The public is invited to attend (however space is limited, and attendees are advised to R.S.V.P. by calling (831) 459-2530).</p>

<p>The screening has been made possible by the film's producer Lindsay Doran, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1970 with a B.A. in creative media. The film will open in theaters nationwide on January 27.</p>

<p>Nanny McPhee is a dark and witty fable in which Thompson portrays a person of unsettling appearance and magical powers. She enters the household of the recently widowed Mr. Brown (Firth) and attempts to tame his seven exceedingly ill-behaved children. The children, led by the oldest boy Simon (Love Actually's Thomas Sangster), have managed to drive away 17 previous nannies and are certain that they will have no trouble with this one. But as Nanny McPhee takes control, they begin to notice that their vile behavior now leads swiftly and magically to rather startling consequences.</p>

<p>The film marks producer Doran's third collaboration with Academy Award-winning actress Emma Thompson during a Hollywood career that has now spanned more than two decades. After graduating from UCSC in 1970, Doran lived in England before moving to Los Angeles in 1979. As vice president of creative affairs at Embassy Pictures, she served as the executive in charge of production on two films directed by Rob Reiner-This is Spinal Tap (her first film credit) and The Sure Thing.</p>
<p>Doran joined Paramount Pictures in 1985, where she oversaw the development and production of such films as Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles, The Naked Gun, Pet Sematary, and Ghost. She left Paramount in 1989 to join Sydney Pollack's Mirage Enterprises, where she produced Sense and Sensibility, written by Thompson and directed by Ang Lee.</p>
<p>Sense and Sensibility won the Golden Globe award for Best Picture and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay by Thompson. It was also nominated for six other Academy Awards, including Best Picture and received the Best Film award given by the British Academy of Film and Theater Arts (BAFTA). While at Mirage, Doran additionally served as executive producer on The Firm and Sabrina, both directed by Sydney Pollack.</p>
<p>In 1996, Doran became president and CEO of United Artists Pictures, where she presided over production of the James Bond movies Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. She also oversaw the Man in the Iron Mask and Ronin, as well as the remake of the Thomas Crown Affair.</p>
<p>Doran left United Artists in 1999 and resumed her career as a producer. She is currently the president of Three Strange Angels Inc., a motion picture production company based at Sony Pictures.</p>

In order to do that successfully, she must think about how information is changing in terms of its formats and delivery, and make sure that the library is positioned to continue to be a primary provider of that information.</p><p>"One of the exciting things about UCSC is that the campus is evolving and changing, and so is the library," said Steel, who began work on October 1. "The whole information environment is different today from five or 10 years ago. We really need to continue to demonstrate our relevance to students and faculty, and anticipate the future."</p><p>Steel came to UCSC from Washington, where she served for four years as director of libraries at Washington State University in Pullman. In that capacity, she oversaw the activities of six libraries and a budget of $11 million. Prior to that, Steel spent four years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as associate director for public services, overseeing the operations and facilities of 14 branch libraries. She also held several high- level library management positions at UC San Diego between 1988 and 1997.</p><p>Steel said that one of her high-priority goals in her new position is to facilitate the McHenry Library expansion and renovation project that began this fall.</p><p>"It will create a destination site for learning on campus," Steel noted. "We want to make the library a real hub for UCSC-a place to experiment with new ways of using and manipulating information to create new knowledge."</p><p>The McHenry expansion project will increase the available library space and ultimately provide the campus with a state-of-the-art research facility. It will include such features as a cyber café/study room, a film and music center, distance-learning facilities, group study rooms, wireless Internet connectivity, an electronic research center, and an instructional design center. Construction will take approximately four years, but the library will remain open throughout the entire project.</p><p>"The social element of libraries is very important," Steel observed. "As McHenry Library is located in the center of campus, we are in a perfect location to support the instructional and research work of students, faculty, staff, and the community."</p><p>Steel added that the current library building is now over capacity and lacks space to add the new materials acquired each year. </p><p>"The building was wonderful when it was built 40 years ago, but it needs to be brought up to date with better lighting, technological infrastructure, different seating, and earthquake retrofitting," said Steel. "We need to add rooms for classes and workshops and spaces for lectures and special events. And, for example, Special Collections needs improved spaces in terms of temperature and humidity control for archival collections."</p><p>Steel succeeds interim librarian Robert White, who guided the library for the past two years after the retirement of longtime University Librarian Allan Dyson. She said she hopes to continue to build ties between the library and the academic programs of the university to support teaching, learning, and research in all disciplines.</p><p>"The library is an active environment-it's not just a warehouse of books and a place to ask somebody questions," Steel noted. "We think of the library as an intellectual center on campus outside of the laboratory or classroom where everyone can go."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f66ce8072704601a012ffe7e416f8"><name>797</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Large survey of galaxies yields new findings on star formation</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>DEEP, galaxies, star formation</keywords><start-date>1136790000000</start-date><display-name>Large survey of galaxies...</display-name><path>/2006/01/797</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/01/797</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338154136</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338154136</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>New findings from a large survey of galaxies suggest that star formation is largely driven by the supply of raw materials, rather than by galactic mergers that trigger sudden bursts of star formation. Stars form when clouds of gas and dust collapse under the force of gravity, and the study supports a scenario in which exhaustion of a galaxy's gas supply leads to a gradual decline in the star-formation rate.</p><p>The results, presented this week at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in Washington, D.C., come from the Extended Groth Strip Survey, a collaborative effort using major ground-based and space-based telescopes to focus on one patch of sky that offers a clear view of the distant universe. </p><p>By analyzing data from a combination of powerful instruments, researchers derived information on galaxy weights and star formation rates, as well as the numbers of stars already formed, for more than 3,500 galaxies. They found that the weight (or mass) of a galaxy is an important factor determining how fast it makes stars and how the star formation rate evolves over time, said Kai Noeske, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"The picture we're getting is that heavy galaxies form stars early and rapidly, whereas smaller galaxies form their stars over longer timescales," said Noeske, who presented the group's findings at the AAS meeting on Monday, January 9.</p><p>The study's findings shed light on ongoing debates over the physical mechanisms that activate star formation in galaxies--in particular, the importance of starbursts triggered by mergers of similar galaxies. </p><p>"What we see is consistent with mostly undisturbed galaxies using up their gas over time, like firewood burning down," Noeske said.</p><p>The Extended Groth Strip collaboration consists of astronomers from 16 institutions who have pooled their data and resources to create what is now one of the most intensely studied regions of the sky, said David Koo, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a member of the team. </p><p>Light from distant galaxies takes billions of years to reach Earth, giving astronomers a window into the past. The galaxies included in this study cover a wide range of redshifts (a measure of distance) and corresponding "lookback times," extending out to redshift 1.4 or as far back in time as 9 billion years, about two-thirds of the age of the universe. The study also encompassed galaxies with a wide range of masses.</p><p>"We have now been able to track star formation in galaxies out to modest distances, more than half the age of the universe, and we find that all galaxies, big or small, seem to be fading gradually so that they are less active today than they were further back in time," Koo said.</p><p>Astronomers have found from previous galaxy surveys that star formation activity becomes more intense as they probe farther back in time. One proposed explanation has been that galaxy mergers were more frequent in the past, triggering bursts of star formation due to compression of gas clouds during the merger process. </p><p>"We are finding that mergers do not appear to play the dominant role in star formation, because we see normal-looking, undisturbed galaxies that are undergoing large amounts of star formation," Koo said. </p><p>"There probably are multiple mechanisms that can activate star formation. We are asking which is dominant," he added. "Mergers do drive star formation; they just don't seem to be the major driver."</p><p>Koo and Noeske are both members of the DEEP2 team, one of seven survey teams involved in the Extended Groth Strip Survey. DEEP (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe) began about 15 years ago, led by Koo and other UCSC astronomers using the twin 10-meter Keck Telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to conduct a large-scale survey of distant field galaxies. Phase 2 of the project, led by UCSC and UC Berkeley, began three years ago using the powerful DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II Telescope and has now gathered spectroscopic data from almost 40,000 distant galaxies. </p><p>DEEP2 has observed 13,000 galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip, one of four fields surveyed by the project. Joining the DEEP2 team in the Extended Groth Strip Survey is a broad consortium of other survey teams that are contributing data. Infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope were especially important for Noeske's study, because they enable astronomers to see through the dust that obscures much of the star formation taking place in distant galaxies.</p><p>"Having the infrared data from Spitzer allows us to measure the star formation rates very accurately because we are no longer blinded by dust," Koo said.</p><p>The array of instruments trained on the Extended Groth Strip covers a tremendous range of wavelengths, including x-rays and radio waves, as well as infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. </p><p>"This is an exceptional period of time for astronomy, because for the first time we are able to combine data from almost all of the important wavelengths," Koo said.</p><p>This work is linked to other projects that analyze Extended Groth Strip data. The same session at the AAS meeting includes a presentation by Kevin Bundy of the California Institute of Technology on how the termination of star formation is related to a galaxy's weight and environment. Projects led by Jennifer Lotz of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and Lihwai Lin of National Taiwan University measure the frequency of galaxy mergers and their importance in the production of new stars over the past 8 billion years.</p><p>The following teams contributed to the study presented by Noeske at AAS:</p><p><b>DEEP2 team:</b> Marc Davis (principal investigator), Jeffrey Newman, and Michael Cooper at UC Berkeley; Sandra Faber (co-PI), Kai Noeske (lead author), David Koo, and Susan Kassin at UCSC; Benjamin Weiner at the University of Maryland; Christopher Willmer and Alison Coil at the University of Arizona; and Jennifer Lotz at NOAO.</p><p><b>Spitzer IRAC team</b> (Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope): Giovanni Fazio (PI), Jiasheng Huang, and Pauline Barmby at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and Gillian Wilson at the Spitzer Science Center, Caltech.</p><p><b>Spitzer MIPS team</b> (Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer): George Rieke (PI), Emeric Le Floc'h, and Casey Papovich at the University of Arizona.</p><p><b>Palomar Near Infrared Survey:</b> Richard Ellis (PI) and Kevin Bundy at Caltech, and Christopher Conselice (co-PI) at the University of Nottingham, UK.</p><p><b>GALEX team</b> (Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite): Christopher Martin (PI) and Todd Small at Caltech, and David Schiminovich at Columbia University.</p><p>The EGS collaboration also includes radio astronomers observing this region with the NRAO Very Large Array and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.

She stayed with women banana workers in Honduras and went on road trips to Guatemala and Nicaragua to observe workshops designed for younger members of the union. Frank had meals with the workers and visited their packing plants and union offices.</p><p>As she conducted her research in Latin America, Frank fortuitously discovered a powerful, sophisticated, and highly successful network of women's banana worker activism that is largely unknown to the rest of the world. The result is Bananeras: Women Transforming the Banana Unions of Latin America (South End Press, 2005), a new book that traces the growth of this vital transnational labor movement.</p><p>"It's an amazing story and I just happened into it," said Frank, an expert on U.S. and international labor issues. "I didn't go down there intending to write about it-I just went down to work with the banana unions, and I was stunned by all of the women's projects. My book is about the history and development of these projects for gender equity and power in the banana unions, and how these women were able to build them and win the support of the men."</p><p>There are now 40,000 unionized banana workers in Latin America, the majority of whom work for Chiquita in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. Frank found that since the 1990s, the unions have formed two large national federations that hold regional conferences on important issues--such as how to negotiate contracts or navigate the Central American Free Trade Agreement-and which provide statistical and qualitative analyses of the situation of female workers. </p><p>"The unions date from the late 1950s and were traditionally about two-thirds men and one-third women," said Frank. "Women were always a minority in the unions, but now they are in leadership roles-they've really changed the whole picture. People have these stereotypes of Latin American women as passive victims, but women banana workers are now having sophisticated conversations about gender roles that rival any discussion by students of feminist studies at UCSC." </p><p>Frank noted that the women's projects are always cast as making the unions more democratic and powerful, which is why the men support them. As she writes in the book's introduction:</p><p>"The banana workers of Latin America offer a new model that explicitly integrates gender equity as part and parcel of any effective labor internationalism. They refuse to separate the global struggle against transnational corporations from the struggle at home for women's equality and respect.They inspire us to envision a new labor internationalism that places women's issues at the center of global class politics."</p><p>Frank received the 1999 Book of the Year award from the International Labor History Association for her previous book Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism (Beacon Press, 1999).

Scientists have mostly considered these events in terms of the accretion of new material and other effects on the impacted planet, while little attention has been given to the impactor. (By definition, the impactor is the smaller of the two colliding bodies.)</p><p>But when planets collide, they don't always stick together. About half the time, a planet-sized impactor hitting another planet-sized body will bounce off, and these hit-and-run collisions have drastic consequences for the impactor, said Erik Asphaug, associate professor of Earth sciences at UCSC and first author of the <i>Nature</i> paper.</p><p>"You end up with planets that leave the scene of the crime looking very different from when they came in--they can lose their atmosphere, crust, even the mantle, or they can be ripped apart into a family of smaller objects," Asphaug said.</p><p>The remnants of these disrupted impactors can be found throughout the asteroid belt and among meteorites, which are fragments of other planetary bodies that have landed on Earth, he said. Even the planet Mercury may have been a hit-and-run impactor that had much of its outer layers stripped away, leaving it with a relatively large core and thin crust and mantle, Asphaug said. That scenario remains speculative, however, and requires additional study, he said.</p><p>Asphaug and postdoctoral researcher Craig Agnor used powerful computers to run simulations of a range of scenarios, from grazing encounters to direct hits between planets of comparable sizes. Coauthor Quentin Williams, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC, analyzed the outcomes of these simulations in terms of their effects on the composition and final state of the remnant objects. </p><p>The researchers found that even close encounters in which the two objects do not actually collide can severely affect the smaller object.</p><p>"As two massive objects pass near each other, gravitational forces induce dramatic physical changes--decompressing, melting, stripping material away, and even annihilating the smaller object," Williams said. "You can do a lot of physics and chemistry on objects in the Solar System without even touching them."</p><p>A planet exerts enormous pressure on itself through self-gravity, but the gravitational pull of a larger object passing close by can cause that pressure to drop precipitously. The effects of this depressurization can be explosive, Williams said.</p><p>"It's like uncorking the world's most carbonated beverage," he said. "What happens when a planet gets decompressed by 50 percent is something we don't understand very well at this stage, but it can shift the chemistry and physics all over the place, producing a complexity of materials that could very well account for the heterogeneity we see in meteorites."</p><p>The formation of the terrestrial planets is thought to have begun with a phase of gentle accretion within a disk of gas and dust around the Sun. Embryonic planets gobbled up much of the material around them until the inner Solar System hosted around 100 Moon-sized to Mars-sized planets, Asphaug said. Gravitational interactions with each other and with Jupiter then tossed these protoplanets out of their circular orbits, setting off an era of giant impacts that probably lasted 30 to 50 million years, he said.</p><p>Scientists have used computers to simulate the formation of the terrestrial planets from hundreds of smaller bodies, but most of those simulations have assumed that when planets collide they stick, Asphaug said. </p><p>"We've always known that's an approximation, but it's actually not easy for planets to merge," he said. "Our calculations show that they have to be moving fairly slowly and hit almost head-on in order to accrete."</p><p>It is easy for a planet to attract and accrete a much smaller object than itself. In giant impacts between planet-sized bodies, however, the impactor is comparable in size to the target. In the case of a Mars-size impactor hitting an Earth-size target, the impactor would be one-tenth the mass but fully one-half the diameter of the Earth, Asphaug said.</p><p>"Imagine two planets colliding, one half as big as the other, at a typical impact angle of 45 degrees. About half of the smaller planet doesn't really intersect the larger planet, while the other half is stopped dead in its tracks," Asphaug said. "So there is enormous shearing going on, and then you've got incredibly powerful tidal forces acting at close distances. The combination works to pull the smaller planet apart even as it's leaving, so in the most severe cases the impactor loses a large fraction of its mantle, not to mention its atmosphere and crust."</p><p>According to Agnor, the whole problem of planet formation is highly complex, and unraveling the role played by hit-and-run fragmenting collisions will require further study. By examining planetary collisions from the perspective of the impactor, however, the UCSC researchers have identified physical mechanisms that can explain many puzzling features of asteroids. </p><p>Hit-and-run collisions can produce a wide array of different kinds of asteroids, Williams said. "Some asteroids look like small planets, not very disturbed, and at the other end of the spectrum are ones that look like iron-rich dog bones in space," he said. "This is a mechanism that can strip off different amounts of the rocky material that composes the crust and mantle. What's left behind can range from just the iron-rich core through a whole suite of mixtures with different amounts of silicates."</p><p>One of the puzzles of the asteroid belt is the evidence of widespread global melting of asteroids. Impact heating is inefficient because it deposits heat locally. It is not clear what could turn an asteroid into a big molten blob, but depressurization in a hit-and-run collision might do the trick, Asphaug said.</p><p>"If the pressure drops by a factor of two, you can go from something that is merely hot to something molten," he said. </p><p>Depressurization can also boil off water and release gases, which would explain why many differentiated meteorites tend to be free of water and other volatile substances. These and other processes involved in hit-and-run collisions should be studied in more detail, Asphaug said.</p><p>"It's a new mechanism for planetary evolution and asteroid formation, and it suggests a lot of interesting scenarios that warrant further study," he said.</p><p>This research was funded by NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Asphaug at (831) 459-2260 or asphaug@pmc.ucsc.edu; Agnor at (831) 459-2426 or cagnor@pmc.ucsc.edu; and Williams at (831) 459-3132 or quentw@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f6af98072704601a012ff8aaebeaf"><name>800</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Essays about Hurricane Katrina by Wynton Marsalis and others appear in new book</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>childs, katrina, hurricane, flood, sociology, emergency, government</keywords><start-date>1136876400000</start-date><display-name>Essays about Hurricane Katrina...</display-name><path>/2006/01/800</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/01/800</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338155205</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338155205</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The weak federal emergency response to Hurricane Katrina fits a pattern of reduced federal government responsibility for public well-being, according to the editor of a new collection of essays about Katrina.</p><p>John Brown Childs, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and editor of the new book <i>Hurricane Katrina: Response and Responsibilities</i> (Santa Cruz, CA: New Pacific Press, 2005), writes that Katrina exposed the consequences of the radical and systematic dismantling of the federal safety net that began with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. </p><p>Childs' chapter, "From New Deal to No Deal: Conservatism's Radical Dismantling of Responsible Government," is the final chapter of the book of 35 essays by scholars, community activists, and others, including New Orleans-born Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and musician Wynton Marsalis. All proceeds from sales of the book go to the People's Hurricane Relief Fund.</p><p>"This book fills the gap between the immediate journalism and the in-depth analysis that will be available in a year or two," said Childs, who was moved to compile the volume while hurricane victims were still confined in the New Orleans Superdome.</p><p>In his essay, Childs contrasts today's "less is more" style of national governing with the philosophy behind the New Deal, which emphasized inclusion. Childs presents a 21st-century alternative to the New Deal he calls "collective individualism," in which government-provided benefits to individuals would circle back to benefit society. Effective relationships between government and community groups are at the heart of his vision, which he proposes for the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast. Childs writes that community groups, labor unions, and other grassroots organizations should be on the front line of Katrina-recovery efforts, providing a link to ensure that hurricane victims receive jobs and job training.</p><p>Throughout the volume, authors analyze the role of government, decry the extent to which race and class shape daily life in the United States, and discuss the "man-made disaster" that followed the natural disaster of Hurricanes Katrina and Stan. </p><p>"The terrible truth is that it is the poor, the most vulnerable, who are the first to suffer," writes Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of <i>Tikkun</i> magazine, calling for decisive action in the rebuilding of New Orleans and the upgrading of housing and the social support infrastructure for the poor in all U.S. inner cities. "Americans are generous, but our government is not wise, and needs the pressure of ordinary citizens to get redirected. Just as we needed a New Deal to get out of the Depression, and not just individual donations to the poor, so today we need a massive societal effort to end poverty as well as rebuild New Orleans."</p><p>"In the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina everything about the social, economic, and racial injustice of American society floated to the surface," writes Bettina Aptheker, UCSC professor of feminist studies and history. "Nothing could be hidden from news cameras on the scene; no sanitized 'spin' could be given to the unfolding catastrophe."</p><p>David Cohen, cofounder of the Advocacy Institute in Washington, D.C., was overseas when the hurricanes struck. "People in Ukraine and Bosnia spoke directly to me," he writes. "They said when you cannot evacuate those in danger, or provide them food and water, you are neither as powerful as you think you are or as caring and kind as you say you are." Cohen writes that the government's failure reveals how "our own government is a threat to our security as a people."</p><p>Stan Oden, assistant professor of government at California State University, Sacramento, writes that the government response "exposed the social, political, and economic underbelly of decades of race and class oppression and governmental indifference to it in the United States," and he calls for reconstruction efforts that train and employ New Orleans residents in construction, urban development, and health care, while reorganizing the city's police department.</p><p>The "policy of intentional neglect toward the plight of the poor" is the way business is done at all levels of government, writes Hardy Frye, professor emeritus of sociology at UCSC.</p><p>Carolyn Dunn, an Irvine Fellow at the Center for American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California, calls the stranding of people of color after the hurricanes "an organized method of genocide" that she likens to the relocation of Native Americans, including her own ancestors in Louisiana.</p><p>In an essay about environmental racism and "cancer alley," an 80-mile stretch from New Orleans to Baton Rouge along which residents live next to highly polluting industries, authors Jose T. Bravo and Arnoldo Garcia write, "Katrina exposed the deadly intersection of race, poverty, immigration status and toxic waste, but dangerous environmental conditions already existed."</p><p>Many contributors see Gulf Coast reconstruction as an opportunity to provide jobs and undo decades of government neglect by working on multiple fronts to revitalize wetlands, reconstruct levees, and build schools, housing, hospitals, child-care and cultural centers, parks, and libraries.</p><p>Detroit-based community activist Sharon Howell, a professor of communication at Oakland University and chair of the Department of Rhetoric, Communication, and Journalism, writes, "Government is the fundamental means we have to express our common, best hopes." </p><p>"I think that the hurricane is a wake-up call for all us people to come together. And you know what? Black people need to get together. We need to do a better job of that," Curtis Reliford, who organized two convoys to truck donated supplies from Santa Cruz to New Orleans, told editor Childs. </p><p>Whether the crisis will generate lasting policy changes or merely fade into the background remains to be seen, says Childs, recalling the televised images of people in desperate need: "It looked sickeningly familiar. It's something you see on a daily basis in our inner cities and on the reservations--people crying out for help and not getting it."</p><p>Michael K. Brown, professor and chair of the Department of Politics at UCSC, says the generosity of ordinary Americans contrasts starkly with "the ineptitude of the government and its abandonment of the poor." But Hurricane Katrina exposed more, he writes: "It ripped open the gauzy facade of a smug, complacent society and revealed the degradation and poverty that are consequences of deeply embedded racial inequality. Will the memory of who the victims were, and why they were in such desperate straits to survive, help us to renew a commitment to social justice, or will we forget?" </p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f6d428072704601a012ffe0211b44"><name>801</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC conference to reflect on New Orleans after Katrina</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1137135600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC conference to reflect...</display-name><path>/2006/01/801</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/01/801</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338155790</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338155790</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Center for Cultural Studies will present a one-day conference, "Reflections on Katrina: Place, Persistence &amp; the Lives of Cities" on Saturday, January 21, from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at Oakes College, Room 105. The conference is the second of three quarterly events in 2005-06 that are part of the Center for Cultural Studies' three-year "Other Globalizations" project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>Before it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina last August, New Orleans was a city of contradictions. Known for its distinctive architecture and atmosphere that meshed elements of African American, Anglo American, French, Cajun, Spanish and Caribbean culture, it boasted a tourism industry that annually generated nearly $5 billion. But the city was less known for its gritty culture of everyday life that was far removed from the tourist image projected around the world.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina exposed the city's contradictions, and current struggles over New Orleans's future have raised critical questions about catastrophe, race, social justice, urban renewal, memory, and the image and marketing of cities. New Orleans is now being forced to confront radically different ideas of exactly what a city is, and what are the responsibilities of local and national institutions to rebuild its communities, preserve its architecture, resolve its inequalities, and honor its memory.</p>
<p>"The aftermath of Katrina has revealed much about the deeply layered character of the global city," noted associate professor of literature Christopher Connery. "We hope that this conference will contribute to our understanding of New Orleans's history, political economy, and future. We also hope to stimulate new thinking about our attachment to cities, and how they are inhabited, imagined, and remembered," Connery added.</p>
<p>Mike Davis, professor of history at UC Irvine, will deliver the keynote address: "Gentrifying Disaster," beginning at 10:15 a.m. Davis's research combines interests in political economy, urban planning, and perceptions of disasters. His most recent book is The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu (New Press, 2005).</p>
