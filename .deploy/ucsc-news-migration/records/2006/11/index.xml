Instead of the usual upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters along the coast during spring and summer, ocean conditions early in the year have been similar to those of an El NiÃ±o, with warm surface waters and low nutrient levels. The effects have rippled through the food web, reducing the amount of food available for fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.</p>

<p>Scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and other institutions have analyzed the events of 2005 in a series of papers published in the journal <em>Geophysical Research Letters (GRL),</em> and they are busy analyzing more data collected this year. At the back of everyone's mind is a troubling question: Are these unusual conditions part of the natural variability of the California Current system, or do they signal a shift to a new oceanographic regime?</p>
<p>"Once is a fluke, but two years in a row makes you think something might be happening. If it happened again next year I'd be really worried," said Raphael Kudela, associate professor of ocean sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>The conditions are consistent with scenarios for the regional effects of global warming, based on the projections of climate models for future decades. Even if the current changes are not related to global warming, they may be giving us a preview of future oceanographic conditions in a warmer world, Kudela said.</p>
<p>Kudela is involved in various ocean monitoring projects with researchers from UCSC and other institutions, and he contributed to several of the <em>GRL</em> papers examining the events of 2005. He said the studies underscore the importance of long-term monitoring projects for detecting and understanding changes in the coastal environment.</p>
<p>The normal upwelling of cold water in the California Current system is driven by wind patterns that push the top layer of warm water offshore, drawing cold, nutrient-rich deeper water to the surface. In 2005--and to a lesser degree in 2006--the spring onset of persistent winds favorable to upwelling was later than usual. Without the influx of nutrients from deep water, the typical springtime blooms of phytoplankton failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton are the "grasslands of the sea," the primary producers of food for the entire ecosystem. Zooplankton, such as the shrimplike krill, graze on the phytoplankton and are, in turn, food for larger animals. Kudela and other researchers were able to trace the effects of the 2005 warm water anomaly on phytoplankton, zooplankton, and animal life higher up the food chain.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers monitoring sea lions in Monterey Bay observed unprecedented feeding behaviors in 2005. Normally a strictly coastal species, the sea lions went hundreds of miles offshore in search of fish, the scientists reported in one of the <em>GRL</em> papers. The study was led by UCSC graduate student Michael Weise and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Daniel Costa (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=817">related news release</a>).</p>
<p>Kudela and his coauthors--William Cochlan of San Francisco State University, UCSC postdoctoral researcher Tawnya Peterson, and Charles Trick of the University of Western Ontario, Canada--found that the phytoplankton recovered quickly when the winds finally kicked in and upwelling began later in the year. But the animals that graze on the phytoplankton took much longer to respond.</p>
<p>"There seems to be a window of opportunity that was missed when the upwelling was delayed," Kudela said. "A key organism is the krill, because krill feed directly on the phytoplankton and they, in turn, are fed on by all kinds of other organisms, from fish and seabirds to whales. So if the krill are affected it has a huge impact."</p>
<p>Phytoplankton blooms are essential for the reproductive success of krill, said Baldo Marinovic, a UCSC research biologist who monitors krill populations in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>"About a week after the eggs hatch, the larvae start feeding, and they can't survive if there are no phytoplankton. The adult krill can survive without the phytoplankton, but they won't reproduce," Marinovic said. "In 2005, the adult krill that had overwintered layed eggs in the spring, but the larvae didn't survive. This year we had a similar situation, although it wasn't as bad because we did have some degree of upwelling."</p>
<p>The krill population recovered later in the year, but by that time it was too late for many of the seabirds and other animals that depend on a springtime boom in the krill population. Scientists reported widespread seabird mortality and nesting failures.</p>
<p>In addition to lower productivity of phytoplankton, the warm water anomalies of 2005 and 2006 have also favored different species of phytoplankton, Kudela said. Single-celled algae called diatoms that tend to dominate in cold, productive waters were replaced by warm-water dinoflagellates that are often associated with "red tides."</p>
<p>"This year we monitored one of the largest red tides I've ever seen in Monterey Bay," Kudela said.</p>
<p>Some dinoflagellates produce dangerous toxins, but so far the red tides along the Central Coast have been dominated by nontoxic species. A species that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning was detected in samples from the red tide, but researchers did not observe any harmful effects on wildlife.</p>
<p>"The dinoflagellates that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning are a minor part of what's turning the water red, but it's scary when they're here," said Mary Silver, a professor of ocean sciences at UCSC. "The state monitoring program does a good job of protecting consumers from toxins in seafood, but the effects on wildlife can be devastating."</p>
<p>One species that was abundant in the red tides produces a slimy mucus material and has been associated with fish kills in other parts of the world (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=646">related news release</a>). But Kudela said the wildlife observed during surveys of the red tide did not seem to be bothered by it. "There were plenty of whales, birds, and fish in it," he said.</p>
<p>According to Silver, the shift to these warm-water species of algae is "scientifically interesting and potentially worrisome."</p>
<p>"It's a sign of a major shift in the ocean. The question is whether it is just a two-year deviation, or is it a longer-term change," she said.</p>
<p>Ongoing monitoring programs will help provide the answer. The monitoring of red tides in Monterey Bay was carried out as part of the Coastal Ocean Applications and Science Team (COAST) sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The <em>GRL</em> papers on the warm-water anomaly of 2005 were based on data from several projects funded by NOAA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), including the River Influences on Shelf Ecosystems (RISE) project of NSF's Coastal Ocean Processes program and the NOAA/NSF-sponsored ECOHAB Pacific Northwest project. The sea lion study was conducted as part of Tagging Of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP), a Census of Marine Life program.</p>

The National Institutes of Health has provided $1.35 million to a team of researchers working to develop new statistical approaches that could dramatically improve the care for severely ill newborn babies. These new methods could eventually be applied to all patients, radically changing the face of hospital care, the researchers said.</p><p>"We are at the forefront of a new wave in medicine," said David Draper, professor of applied mathematics and statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  </p><p>Draper is providing statistical expertise for the project, which is led by Dr. Gabriel Escobar, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek and director of the Perinatal Research Unit at Kaiser Permanente's Division of Research in Oakland. </p><p>The researchers will develop methods that can be incorporated into automated medical records to monitor very ill and critically ill newborns. Their hope is that these methods will eventually take advantage of Kaiser Permanente's decision to deploy an automated medical record system, Escobar said. Electronic records will make it possible to perform instant computer analyses of an individual patient's medical data, while also giving researchers access to an entire database of medical records for similar patients. </p><p>In particular, Escobar's team wants to improve treatment strategies for newborn babies potentially at risk for infection. Their approach would permit a bedside computer to estimate a newborn's risk by combining the baby's data with information from previous newborn patients. Based on the baby's current condition and how other babies fared in the past, computer algorithms could provide physicians with accurate estimates of the probabilities of a variety of outcomes, including death or the need for highly invasive treatments. Doctors could provide early intervention if the analysis indicated a high probability of an adverse outcome. </p><p>Researchers envision that in the future such algorithms could even suggest treatment options to doctors. Draper, who has been working on statistical approaches to medicine for 20 years, said this is "by far the most exciting development that's come along in quite awhile for making optimal use of medical information to improve clinical care."</p><p>Other members of the research team are coprincipal investigator Dr. Thomas B. Newman of UCSF, and Dr. Ellice Lieberman, Dr. John Zupancic, and Dr. Karen Puopolo of Harvard University. The project is funded by a three-year grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.</p><p>Draper and one of his former Ph.D. students, Milovan Krnjajic (now at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), are working on the statistical tools and algorithms that drive the entire project. Their methods use Bayesian statistics, an approach Draper predicts will become "the dominant statistical paradigm for the 21st century."</p><p>The Bayesian approach provides a rigorous mathematical framework for combining new information with existing knowledge to assess a given situation. These tools will enable the system to calculate a likely prognosis for a newborn based on the past history for that baby and the medical histories of other babies. Armed with the experience of an entire database of case histories, doctors will be able to make better-informed decisions.</p><p>According to Escobar, the statistical methodology proposed by Draper was a key factor in enabling them to win funding for this project. </p><p>"Working with him has had a tremendous impact not only on this project, but on the entire way I approach my research," Escobar said. </p><p>Quantitative methods, like the Apgar score developed in 1952, have revolutionized newborn care. But there are still major shortcomings, Draper said. Existing approaches to quantitative outcome prediction are limited in that they use only a fraction of the available information and only for fixed time durations (usually either 12 or 24 hours). Generally, current algorithms examine a few variables in the time frame, select the worst result for each variable, and generate a single probability estimate. This severely limits their use in actual clinical situations, which constantly evolve, he said.</p><p>"Many sick babies die or become critically ill during the first 12 to 24 hours after birth," Draper said. "It would be far better to use information as it arrives."</p><p>The power of Bayesian statistical tools lies in their ability to readily take into account changing conditions. For example, current approaches only incorporate one value of heart rate and ignore whether it is rising, falling, or staying the same. The new methods will be dynamic, accounting for changes over time in variables such as heart rate or respiratory rate as they produce a statistical gauge of a baby's health.</p><p>Embedded in an electronic medical record, these methods could help a doctor decide whether to take certain risks when treating a severely ill baby. According to Escobar, only half of the hospitals in the United States are equipped to care for a severely ill newborn. Transporting the baby to another hospital is not only expensive, but it also poses inherent risks. On the other hand, failure to move a baby that needs specialized care could lead to brain damage or death.  </p><p>"Should the doctor drop everything and get the baby out of there, or can he or she assume things are going well? That's what we need to know," Escobar said.  </p><p>Newer statistical approaches will give physicians important information in making such critical decisions, and, as a result, could save lives, he said.</p><p>Bayesian methods can also prevent unnecessary and painful tests by giving a doctor a more accurate description of how sick the baby is and whether tests are really needed, Escobar said. Another goal of the project is to help scientists see how well common screening tests--such as counting white blood cells--work, he said. While the project is aimed at treating newborns, these methods can be applied toward all patients.</p><p>"The beauty of this project is that the approach we're going to be using could be generalized to other conditions," Escobar said.</p><p>Researchers will spend the first several years of the study period collecting and analyzing paper and electronic data from 340,000 newborns in 14 hospitals in northern California and Boston. They expect their statistical methods will be up and running in three to five years and could be embedded in automated hospital records in five to 10 years. Such systems will improve over time as the size of the database increases, generating more accurate estimates based on growing amounts of properly analyzed data, Draper said.  </p><p>"Developing these methods is challenging, but it is likely that more and more hospitals will employ them in the future," Escobar said. "It used to seem like science fiction, but I don't think it is anymore." </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Draper at (831) 459-1295 or draper@ams.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915079128072704601a012ff350ae31e"><name>973</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Professor Emeritus Elliot Aronson receives lifetime achievement award from the Association for Psychological Science</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>aronson, psychology, award, lifetime, achievement, social psychology</keywords><start-date>1163401200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Professor Emeritus Elliot...</display-name><path>/2006/11/973</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/11/973</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338224348</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338224348</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Called a man who has "fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life," preeminent social psychologist Elliot Aronson has received a lifetime achievement award from the Association for Psychological Science.</p>

The William James Fellow Award is the latest honor bestowed upon Aronson, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
<p>A renowned scholar, teacher, and author, Aronson conducted pathbreaking research on cognitive dissonance and interpersonal attraction before championing the use of social psychological principles to address societal problems, including racial prejudice, energy and water shortages, and AIDS. In the laboratory, Aronson became known for the elegance and simplicity of his experiments. A resident of Santa Cruz, Aronson will receive the APS award at the association's annual convention, which will take place next spring in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The William James Fellow Award honors recipients for a lifetime of significant intellectual contributions to the basic science of psychology. Recipients must be APS members recognized internationally for their outstanding contributions to scientific psychology.</p>
<p>Aronson, 74, who came to UCSC in 1974, has remained active since retiring in 1994. Despite suffering from macular degeneration, which has robbed him of his central vision, Aronson has coauthored with Carol Tavris the forthcoming book, <em>Mistakes Were Made (but not by me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts</em>. He is also revising his classic textbook, <em>The Social Animal</em>, and recently published a children's book, <em>The Adventures of Ruthie and a Little Boy Named Grandpa</em>, with his seven-year-old granddaughter Ruth Aronson. "After all, it is only my eyesight I have lost, not my vision!" quipped Aronson, who was one of only nine scholars invited to contribute a chapter for the book, <em>The History of Psychology in Autobiography, Volume 9</em>, due out next year from APA Books.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the APS cited Aronson's "career-long contributions in empirical research, in theory, in research methodology, in practical application, and in education. His elegant and seminal experiments have fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life."</p>
<p>Aronson's major contribution to the theory of cognitive dissonance, which revealed how people strive to alter their attitudes to conform to their actions, recognized the critical role of a person's self-concept in the arousal of cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>He also conducted a series of experiments on interpersonal attraction that reversed the pop-psychology principle that the route to being liked is to be agreeable and complimentary to others. His work demonstrated the conditions under which a person who committed a clumsy blunder could be more liked than one who didn't, and the conditions under which a person who criticized another could be more liked than one who didn't. The experiments were "empirical and theoretical <em>tours de force</em>" in the field of psychology, said psychology professor Anthony G. Greenwald of the University of Washington, who nominated Aronson for the William James Award.</p>
<p>As Aronson turned his attention to applying social psychology to important societal problems, he developed a technique called "The Jigsaw Classroom" to reduce racial prejudice by increasing interaction, cooperation, and interdependence among students of different races. His subsequent work responded to energy shortages, water shortages, and the AIDS epidemic, harnessing induced hypocrisy to motivate behavioral changes, including conservation and increased use of condoms.</p>
<p>A master of "experimental realism," Aronson was expert at setting up realistic situations in the laboratory that had a powerful impact on his subjects' involvement in the experimental situation, for which Greenwald hailed him as part of a small group he called "a pantheon of modern social psychology."</p>
<p>The APS honor follows a lifetime achievement award from the American Psychological Association, election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Distinguished Career Award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. In 1980, he became the first person in the history of the APA to receive both a distinguished teaching award and a distinguished research award. He has also been honored with a Guggenheim Fellowship, as well as a special research award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1978, he was selected as the first recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Alumni Association. His textbook, <em>The Social Animal</em>, received the coveted National Media Award in 1973 and remains among the most popular texts in social psychology.</p>

Carr, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, serves on the Science Advisory Team that is helping to implement California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). Passed by voters in 1999, the MLPA is moving toward the establishment of an unprecedented network of marine protected areas along the entire California coast. </p><p>"The establishment of marine reserves is one of the biggest marine conservation issues not only in California, but the whole world," Carr said.</p><p>The network of 29 marine protected areas proposed for the Central Coast by the California Fish and Game Commission would include the coastal area outside Carr's office at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. Extending along four miles of the coastline and 200 feet out to sea, the Natural Bridges State Marine Reserve would be a "no-take" zone, a sanctuary for every fish, mussel, and barnacle within its boundaries. Created in the spirit of protected lands like Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks, the proposed network also includes protected areas with fewer restrictions where some forms of recreational or commercial fishing would be allowed.</p><p>As a member of the MLPA initiative's Science Advisory Team, Carr plays a pivotal role in ensuring decisions are made based on sound science. The 17 members of the team, experts in areas like fisheries science and marine ecology, provide guidelines on how to design a network of marine protected areas to best conserve and protect marine ecosystems. They also evaluate the various network designs proposed by interest groups, which include representatives from commercial and sport fishermen, divers, and conservationists. Finally, the science advisers are responsible for explaining the science of marine ecosystems to those stakeholders and policy makers.</p><p> </p><p>The MLPA was written in response to troubling declines of fish populations. But the act has suffered its share of setbacks, including being put on hold indefinitely in 2004 when funding ran dry. A partnership between private foundations and the state later revived the initiative and has focused initially on establishing reserves along the central California coast from Pigeon Point to Point Conception. </p><p>In August of this year, with the guidance of the Science Advisory Team, the California Fish and Game Commission voted to select a preferred plan of marine protected areas that will line the Central Coast. The commission is scheduled to consider adopting the proposal and issuing regulations to implement the preferred plan in March 2007. Under the terms of the MLPA, the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) plans to establish a network of marine protected areas along the entire California coast by 2011. </p><p>Now that the first phase of the MLPA is coming close to fruition, Carr said he is pleased about the role of science in the planning process.</p><p> </p><p>"This is a great success story in terms of science being incorporated into policy," he said. "The policy makers and interest groups involved truly valued the scientific basis for the decision-making process, which is not always the case in policy making."</p><p>One major scientific issue relates to the size of the reserves and how far apart they should be, Carr said. The protected areas must provide enough space for animals to swim freely, yet remain within reserve boundaries. Therefore, marine protected areas are most applicable for species with limited movement. Other species--sharks, tuna, and sea lions, for example--can travel hundreds of miles, beyond the practical limits of a marine reserve. </p><p>In order to protect as many species as possible, scientists recommended that individual reserves should stretch at least three miles along the coast, but preferably six or more miles, and should extend out to three miles offshore. This would protect invertebrates with limited mobility like abalone and mussel, yet still be large enough to protect more mobile species like rockfish and halibut.</p><p> </p><p>A unique characteristic of marine ecosystems is that the majority of fish have what scientists call open populations, Carr said. The offspring of rockfish, sheepshead, and other nearshore species are not restricted to the place where they hatch. After hatching, fish larvae drift away, and by the time they return to their adult habitat they may be far away from their birthplace. Because of this, marine protected areas must be sufficiently close together to allow the reserves to help populate one another, as well as the unprotected areas in between. Based on studies of how far fish larvae can travel, the advisory team recommended that the protected areas must be within 30 to 60 miles of each other.</p><p>"I'm generally happy because the political process did pay attention to the science we provided them with," Carr said.</p><p>According to Carr, the biggest challenge was in evaluating the various proposals from stakeholders with conflicting interests. The scientists drew from a wide range of studies on how species interact in the ecosystem to assess how well the different plans would protect the ecosystem. The DFG reached a compromise by combining elements of the different proposals. Now that the Science Advisory Team has devised an evaluation procedure, the next phase of the MLPA in completing the statewide network of reserves should be easier, Carr said. </p><p>Levels of marine protection have long been lagging behind land protection, he said. Marine reserves currently make up less than 0.1 percent of all U.S. waters, and less than 0.01 percent of waters in California. The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary currently has largest network of marine protected areas on the West Coast--12 protected areas covering 175 square miles that were established separately from the MLPA process in 2003. The Central Coast network proposed under the MLPA would cover 204 square miles. Although the many different kinds of land reserves make it hard to pinpoint how much land is similarly protected, it is undoubtedly more than the amount of protected marine areas, Carr said. </p><p>"It's because of a fundamental difference in how we view ownership of the marine environment," he said.</p><p>Increasingly, however, people are recognizing the need to conserve the oceans, and with the MLPA, California is leading the way to a new era of marine conservation, Carr said.</p><p>For more information, visit the MLPA's web site at <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/">http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/</a>. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Carr at (831) 459-3958 or carr@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91507d958072704601a012ff448ed46d"><name>976</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz literature professor Nathaniel Mackey wins National Book Award</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1163660400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz literature...</display-name><path>/2006/11/976</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/11/976</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338225499</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338225499</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz literature professor Nathaniel Mackey has received a 2006 National Book Award in the poetry category for his latest book, "Splay Anthem."

The awards are presented annually by the National Book Foundation. Finalists were selected by four panels of judges who were asked to choose the best books of the year from nearly 13,000 entries submitted by publishers.<br/>
<br/>
<p>As a poet, literary critic, fiction writer, and journal editor, Mackey has produced a wide variety of work over the past 27 years that has earned him national and international recognition. He is the author of nine books of poetry, including "Four for Trane," "Septet for the End of Time," "Outlantish," and "Song of the Andoumboulou," which are widely regarded as among the most innovative examples of contemporary American experimental writing.</p>
<p>Mackey's 1985 poetry book, "Eroding Witness," was selected for publication in the National Poetry Series. He received a Whiting Writer's Award in 1993 and was elected to the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets in 2001, one of the highest honors in the field of poetry. He was also selected by faculty members to deliver the 39th annual Faculty Research Lecture at UC Santa Cruz last February in recognition of his "extraordinary accomplishments in many fields of scholarly and creative activity."</p>
<p>Mackey's two volumes of literary criticism include "Paracritical Hinge," published last year by the University of Wisconsin Press, and "Discrepant Engagement: Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing" (Cambridge University Press, 1993). For the past 30 years, Mackey has also single-handedly served as editor of the literary journal "Hambone," which brings together diverse strands of innovative work from both established and emerging writers.</p>
<p>Known as an authority on the relations between African and African American music and writing, Mackey has edited an influential anthology, "Moment's Notice: Jazz in Poetry and Prose" (1993), and produced a poetry CD in collaboration with contemporary jazz musicians. He has also completed three novels in a series titled "From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate"--composed as letters written by a composer/multi-instrumentalist named N, a founding member of a fictional band known as the Mystic Horn Society. His longtime radio program on Santa Cruz public radio station KUSP, "Tanganyika Strut," continues to spotlight African music throughout the world.</p>
<p>Mackey graduated with high honors in English from Princeton University in 1969 and completed his Ph.D at Stanford. He taught at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California, where he directed the Black Studies Program, before joining the UCSC faculty in 1979.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91507eeb8072704601a012ffdaa88719"><name>977</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supercomputer study shows Milky Way's halo of dark matter in unprecedented detail</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Madau, dark matter</keywords><start-date>1164006000000</start-date><display-name>Supercomputer study shows Milky...</display-name><path>/2006/11/977</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/11/977</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338225845</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338225845</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have used NASA's most powerful supercomputer to run the largest simulation to date of the formation and evolution of the dark matter halo that envelops the Milky Way galaxy.

<p>Every galaxy is surrounded by a halo of mysterious dark matter that can only be detected indirectly by observing its gravitational effects. The invisible halo is much larger and more spherical than the luminous galaxy at its center. Recent computer simulations have shown that the halo is surprisingly clumpy, with relatively dense concentrations of dark matter in gravitationally bound 'subhalos' within the halo. The new study, which has been accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal,</em> shows much more extensive substructure than any previous study.</p>
<p>"We find almost 10,000 subhalos, about one order of magnitude more than in any past simulations, and some of our subhalos exhibit 'subsubstructure.' This was expected theoretically, but we have shown it for the first time in a numerical simulation," said Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>JÃ¼rg Diemand, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and first author of the paper, said the new results exacerbate what is known as the "missing satellite problem." The problem is that the clumpiness of the normal matter in and around our galaxy--in the form of dwarf satellite galaxies--does not match the clumpiness of the dark matter seen in the simulation.</p>
<p>"Astronomers keep discovering new dwarf galaxies, but there are still only about 15 or so, compared to about 120 dark matter subhalos of comparable size in our simulation. So which ones host the dwarf galaxies, and why?" Diemand said.</p>
<p>Theoretical models in which star formation is restricted to certain types of dark matter halos--sufficiently massive or early-forming ones--may help to resolve the discrepancy, Madau said.</p>
<p>Although the nature of dark matter remains a mystery, it appears to account for about 82 percent of the matter in the universe. As a result, the evolution of structure in the universe has been driven by the gravitational interactions of dark matter. The "normal" matter that forms gas and stars has fallen into the "gravitational wells" created by clumps of dark matter, giving rise to galaxies in the centers of dark matter halos.</p>
<p>Initially, gravity acted on slight density fluctuations present shortly after the Big Bang to pull together the first clumps of dark matter. These grew into larger and larger clumps through the hierarchical merging of smaller progenitors. This is the process the UCSC researchers simulated on the Columbia supercomputer at the NASA Ames Research Center, one of the fastest computers in the world. The simulation took a couple of months to complete, running on 300 to 400 processors at a time for 320,000 "cpu-hours," Diemand said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Michael Kuhlen, who began working on the project as a graduate student at UCSC and is now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, said the researchers set the initial conditions based on the most recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) experiment. Released in March, the new WMAP results provide the most detailed picture ever of the infant universe.</p>
<p>The simulation starts at about 50 million years after the Big Bang and calculates the interactions of 234 million particles of dark matter over 13.7 billion years of cosmological time to produce a halo on the same scale as the Milky Way's. The clumps within the halo are the remnants of mergers in which the cores of smaller halos survived as gravitationally bound subhalos orbiting within the larger host system.</p>
<p>The simulation produced five massive subhalos (each more than 30 million times the mass of the Sun) and many smaller ones within the inner 10 percent of the host halo. Yet only one known dwarf galaxy (Sagittarius) is that close to the center of the Milky Way, Diemand said.</p>
<p>"There are big clumps of dark matter in the same region where the disk of the Milky Way would be. So even in the local neighborhood of our solar system, the distribution of dark matter may be more complicated than we have assumed," he said.</p>
<p>Astronomers may be able to detect clumps of dark matter within the Milky Way's halo with future gamma-ray telescopes, but only if the dark matter consists of the types of particles that would give rise to gamma-ray emissions. Certain dark matter candidates--such as the neutralino, a theoretical particle predicted by supersymmetry theory--could annihilate (that is, be mutually destroyed) in collisions, generating new particles and emitting gamma rays.</p>
<p>"Existing gamma-ray telescopes have not detected dark matter annihilation, but upcoming experiments will be more sensitive, so there is some hope that individual subhalos may produce an observable signature," Kuhlen said.</p>
<p>In particular, astronomers look forward to interesting results from the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), scheduled for launch in 2007, he said.</p>
<p>The simulation also provides a useful tool for observational astronomers studying the oldest stars in our galaxy by providing a link between current observations and earlier phases of galaxy formation, Diemand said.</p>
<p>"The first small galaxies formed very early, about 500 million years after the Big Bang, and there are still today stars in our galaxy that formed at this early time, like a fossil record of early star formation. Our simulation can provide the context for where those old stars came from and how they ended up in dwarf galaxies and in certain orbits in the stellar halo today," Diemand said.</p>

<p>The boundary between the core and the mantle lies half-way to the center of the Earth, at a depth of 1,740 miles (2,900 kilometers). Seismologists are able to probe the structure of this region by studying its effects on seismic waves generated by earthquakes. The new temperature measurements, published in the November 24 issue of the journal <em>Science,</em> were obtained by relating seismic observations to a recently discovered mineral transformation that occurs at the ultrahigh pressures and temperatures prevailing near the core-mantle boundary.</p>
<p>"This is the first time we've had a 'thermometer' that tells us the temperature half-way down to the center of the Earth," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and first author of the paper.</p>
<p>"If our interpretation is right, it gives us the temperature at two different depths right above each other, so we get not just the absolute temperature but the rate at which the temperature is changing with depth, as well as laterally," Lay said. "This temperature gradient tells us the amount of heat flowing out of the core into the base of the mantle in that location."</p>
<p>As heat flows from the outer core into the mantle, it drives important processes in both the mantle and the core. The mantle is a thick layer of silicate rock that surrounds a dense, predominantly iron core. The outer core is molten liquid and surrounds a solid inner core about the size of the moon. The cooling of the liquid outer core results in fluid motions in the molten metal that produce electric currents, which generate the geomagnetic field.</p>
<p>Heating at the base of the mantle, meanwhile, drives upwellings of hot mantle material that may rise to volcanoes at the surface and contribute to the slow shifting of tectonic plates. These plates consist of the thin, rocky crust and the rigid top layer of the mantle. They float on the deeper mantle, which is solid but plastic enough to flow very slowly, and their movements trigger earthquakes and gradually change the positions of continents.</p>
<p>"Heat flow is the holy grail, because it tells us how much energy powers the geodynamo, and it tells us how much the mantle is being heated from below. The approach we used is the most direct method so far for getting that information," Lay said.</p>
<p>Lay's coauthors include John Hernlund of the Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris, Edward Garnero of Arizona State University, and Michael Thorne of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. They applied innovative methods for analyzing seismic signals and used a supercomputer to process a large amount of high-quality seismic data, more than ever before analyzed for a localized region in the Earth. The analysis required 72,000 hours of computer time at the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and produced very detailed seismic velocity models for the deep mantle under the central Pacific.</p>
<p>Their investigation also relied heavily on laboratory studies of mineral physics. Under the extreme pressures and temperatures deep in the Earth, minerals are squeezed into crystal structures not seen on the surface, except in a few specialized mineral physics labs. If scientists take the common mineral olivine and squeeze it--subjecting it to the ultrahigh pressures and temperatures associated with increasing depth in the Earth--the mineral goes through phase transitions involving sudden reorganizations of its crystal structure.</p>
<p>These phase transitions change the mineral's seismic properties--how fast it transmits certain seismic waves--enabling seismologists to detect where the phase transitions occur deep in the Earth. The depth of the transition tells researchers the pressure, and from that they can get the temperature based on laboratory calibrations, since the pressure at which the transition occurs depends on the temperature.</p>
<p>"If we detect a sudden change in the seismic properties of the mantle, we can associate that with a phase transition in the minerals, and we can use the laboratory calibrations to tell us how hot it is. But until two years ago, we never had that kind of information for the lower mantle," Lay said.</p>
<p>In 2004, Japanese researchers working in the laboratory discovered a new form of high-pressure mineral, called postperovskite, that is likely to occur in the lower mantle. Lay and his coauthors detected the phase transition to postperovskite from its precursor perovskite in the lowermost mantle near the core-mantle boundary. Moreover, they observed that the mineral appears and then disappears with increasing depth, forming a layer or "lens" of postperovskite.</p>
<p>"The reason it transforms back into perovskite is that the temperature increases very rapidly right above the core--so rapidly that this high-pressure form becomes unstable," Lay said. "We also see that this layer becomes thinner as you move laterally and eventually thins out and disappears, which you would expect if you have a lateral increase in temperature."</p>
<p>The researchers suspect that upwelling of hot mantle material may be taking place at the edges of the lens of postperovskite. They detected the lens in the lowermost mantle southeast of Hawaii, an area where previous studies have suggested there is an upwelling hot mantle plume from near the core-mantle boundary that may be responsible for the Hawaiian Islands chain of volcanoes.</p>
<p>The temperature at the upper boundary of the lens, where the phase transition from perovskite to postperovskite occurs, is around 2,500 kelvins (4,000 degrees Fahrenheit). At the lower boundary, where the reverse transition occurs, the temperature is around 3,500 kelvins (5,800 degrees Fahrenheit). These two points gave the researchers a temperature gradient from which they calculated the heat flow, or thermal flux: about 80 milliwatts per square meter. Extrapolating to the entire surface of the core gave a total heat flow of about 13 trillion watts.</p>
<p>"We think we are in a relatively hot region of the mantle, and cooler areas will have an even higher heat flux, so this probably sets a lower bound on the total heat flow across the core-mantle boundary. The numbers you might read in a textbook are about one-third of that," Lay said.</p>
<p>Such a high heat flow supports the idea that the upwelling of hot plumes of mantle material from near the core-mantle boundary makes a significant contribution to mantle convection, the slow turnover of mantle material that moves tectonic plates on the surface. It also suggests that the solid inner core may be relatively young.</p>
<p>"The core must have been pretty hot in the past for this much heat to be still coming out, and the inner core, which is slowly solidifying from the inside out as the core cools, may be only about a billion years old," Lay said.</p>
<p>"These implications are not well constrained, but it's amazing that you can go from detecting seismic reflections to this long-term perspective on how the whole system seems to work," he added. "It's a remarkable convergence of advances in seismology, mineral physics, and thermodynamical models of deep mantle processes."</p>
<p>This research was supported by the EarthScope and Geophysics Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The high-quality seismic data analyzed in this study was obtained, in part, by the deployment of hundreds of new seismic stations in the western United States as part of NSF's EarthScope Program.</p>

That's the vision behind an ambitious two-year study of the feasibility of "farm-to-institution" programs being launched this month by researchers at the University of California's Santa Cruz and Davis campuses.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"These programs could be a lifeline for small- to mid-scale farmers struggling to stay afloat, and would improve the eating habits of millions of Americans, from young schoolchildren to elderly hospital patients," said project director Patricia Allen, associate director of the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p>If institutional food buyers embrace sustainably produced goods, including organic and fair-trade edibles, the environmental gains could be enormous, said Allen. "Due to the size of the institutional food market, farm-to-institution programs could catalyze a fundamental transformation in the way the nation produces and distributes food," she said.</p>
<p>Farm-to-institution programs are sprouting up around the country, and the institutional demand for fresh, sustainably produced food is growing nationwide. The project is the first large-scale assessment of the nation's appetite for food-to-institution programs. It encompasses a national survey of college students' food preferences, a survey of the priorities of institutional food buyers in California, and an evaluation of distribution models that could be developed to get more fresh, locally grown food into institutions, including schools, universities, and hospitals.</p>
<p>Allen will be joined on the project by codirector Shermain Hardesty, Cooperative Extension specialist in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis; Jan Perez, associate specialist at CASFS; and Gail Feenstra, food systems analyst, and Jeri Ohmart, food systems program representative, with the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP). Additionally, staff at the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF) will collaborate on the project, including program director Anya Fernald, program manager Kristen Schroer, and Marisol Asselta, coordinator of CAFF's Central Coast "Buy Fresh, Buy Local" campaign.</p>
<p>"Very little is known about the distribution of local produce from small and mid-sized farms to institutions," said Feenstra."We want to find out what works and share this information with the farmers. They're the ones who are disappearing from the landscape the fastest, and we believe they're the ones best positioned to take advantage of the institutional markets we are targeting."</p>
<p>The project, "Increasing Value-Added Profits for Small and Medium-scale Growers: The Institutional Market," will analyze the feasibility of farm-to-institution models, quantify the demand for such programs, and survey individuals and institutions about their interests and willingness to pay for foods grown in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner on small and medium-sized farms.</p>
<p>"The survey of buyers for food service operations at California's universities and colleges will enable us to assess their produce preferences and purchasing practices," said Hardesty. "If the transaction costs significantly affect their decisions to purchase from small- and medium-sized producers, then we'll need to recommend alternative systems that reduce these transaction costs."</p>
<p>On the farm side, researchers will assess the potential profitability of farm-to-institution programs, explore ways that farmers can tap these markets, and identify mechanisms to ease food distribution so institutions can meet their food demands without having to contract individually with multiple growers.</p>
<p>Americans spent nearly $5 billion on food expenditures away from home in 2004, and institutions capture a quarter of this market, said Allen. In California, more than 21,000 education and health care institutions provide meals daily.</p>
<p>"The institutional foods market has been largely untapped by small- and mid-sized farmers," said Allen. "If institutional contracts incorporate sustainability criteria, a huge market could be transformed with an incentive-based approach, rather than through regulation." Such criteria could include wage and benefits requirements for food-system workers and reducing the use of toxic pesticides, she added.</p>
<p>The two-year project is being funded by a $400,000 grant from the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>"It's exciting to see the caliber of the two UC programs that are collaborating with CAFF on this project, and it's encouraging that the USDA is supporting this innovative research," noted Fernald.</p>

In living cells, nutrients are broken down in a series of reactions and the energy is harnessed in the mitochondria, the power plants of the cells. The reactions produce electrons, and cytochrome oxidase uses the electrons to convert oxygen into water, a process that releases energy. At the same time, the enzyme pumps positively-charged particles (protons) across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, thus storing energy in a manner similar to charging a battery. This then spurs another enzyme to make an energy-carrying molecule called ATP that powers biological activity in living organisms.</p><p>Einarsdottir has led the way in developing a technique for triggering the reaction of cytochrome oxidase with oxygen using a laser. Rapid snapshots of the enzyme are then recorded in order to dissect how the enzyme works. By taking snapshots as fast as every 100 billionths of a second, Einarsdottir and her coworkers are able to probe the chemical and molecular changes underlying this fundamental process of biology.</p><p> </p><p>This year's AAAS Fellows were announced in the November 24 issue of <i>Science.</i> The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874.
