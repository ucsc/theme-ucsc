The award recognizes McPherson for his leadership in the Friends of Long Marine Lab and his commitment to the local coastal environment.</p><p>Awards will also be presented to two promising marine sciences students at UC Santa Cruz. The Global Oceans Awards were established in 2004 to recognize outstanding individuals who are making a difference for the world's oceans. The annual dinner, held this year at the Bittersweet Bistro in Rio del Mar, is one of the most popular fundraising events for the Friends of Long Marine Lab.</p><p>McPherson became secretary of state in 2005 after 11 years in the state legislature. A fourth-generation Santa Cruz native, he served three years in the assembly representing Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, followed by eight years in the state senate. While in the legislature, McPherson earned a reputation as a moderate and nonpartisan officeholder--a fiscal conservative who fought to protect California's environment and scenic coastlines. </p><p>Prior to his election to the assembly, McPherson served as the founding president of the Friends of Long Marine Lab, a community support group dedicated to supporting and promoting the public outreach activities of the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory at UCSC. As an assemblyman, McPherson advocated and played a key role in obtaining state funding for construction of UCSC's Earth and Marine Sciences Building, home to the Institute of Marine Sciences. As a state senator, he helped secure funding for the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, which houses Environmental Studies and other programs. Throughout his tenure in California politics, McPherson has helped to protect coastal open space and promote public access. He also helped to fund the "mussel watch" program, which tests for toxins in shellfish, and cast the deciding vote to ban offshore oil drilling in state waters.</p><p>Graduate students Leslie Roland and Dana Wingfield will also receive awards at the dinner. They had the top-ranked proposals among 16 students who received research support from the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards this year. These awards provided more than $11,000 in total funding for undergraduate and graduate student research projects in the marine sciences.</p><p>Roland, who works with UCSC assistant professor of ocean sciences Matthew McCarthy, is identifying the composition of particles suspended in the water below the ocean surface and sinking into the "twilight zone." Wingfield, who works with UCSC professor of Earth sciences Gary Griggs, is elucidating habitat use of foraging juvenile loggerhead turtles in Baja California Sur, Mexico.</p><p>For more information about the Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner and Awards Gala, contact Lisa M.

In a series of lectures in Santa Cruz on April 19 and 20, titled "Quaking 'n' Breaking: Earthquakes to Tsunamis: Then and There, Here and Now," experts will examine these risks in the context of local disaster history and recent global calamities. </p><p>The talks mark the centennial of the April 18, 1906, San Francisco earthquake. On Wednesday, April 19, local historian Sandy Lydon and UC Santa Cruz geologist Gary Griggs will discuss the earthquake history and present-day geological realities of central California. On Thursday, April 20, oceanographer Bruce Jaffe and geologist Harvey Kelsey will examine the threat of tsunamis. </p><p>Sponsored by the Seymour Center at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, the lectures will take place at 7 p.m. at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean Street, in Santa Cruz. Tickets cost $6 per evening or $10 for the series for the general public ($5 per evening or $8 for the series for Friends of Long Marine Lab members). For tickets and information about the lectures, call (831) 459-3800.</p><p>Griggs, a professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC, and Lydon, who teaches history at Cabrillo College, are coauthoring a book on the history of natural disasters in the Monterey Bay Area. In their talks, Griggs and Lydon will discuss the major seismic events that have struck the area during the past several hundred years, including the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Griggs will provide insights into the geological mechanisms underlying the quakes, and Lydon will describe how human populations responded to the calamities.</p><p>Jaffe and Kelsey are former students of Griggs who earned their Ph.D.s in Earth sciences at UCSC. Jaffe is now an oceanographer at the U.S. Geological Survey Pacific Science Center in Santa Cruz. He will present highlights from his trip to Sri Lanka and Indonesia to study the effects of the devastating tsunami that struck southern Asia in 2004. Triggered by an undersea earthquake, the tsunami rose 100 feet above the coast and traveled 3 miles inland. Jaffe found vast and widespread devastation, especially in northwest Sumatra. In some areas, however, the inhabitants had escaped destruction by wisely fleeing inland after sensing the quake. </p><p>Kelsey, an adjunct professor and research associate in geology at Humboldt State University in Arcata, specializes in the study of earthquake history. He will present findings on the Cascadia subduction zone, a major offshore fault that extends from southwestern Canada to northern California. The Cascadia fault has been the main source of earthquake-generated tsunamis that have struck the West Coast in the past. Layers of sand deposited in an Oregon coastal lake during the past 4,600 years bear testimony to past earthquakes and tsunamis along this zone, Kelsey said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f91dd8072704601a012ff099e06fe"><name>831</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores dramatic political life of black activist</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1142578800000</start-date><display-name>New book explores dramatic...</display-name><path>/2006/03/831</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/831</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338165162</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338165162</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new biography by UC Santa Cruz associate history professor David Anthony traces the history of black activist Max Yergan--a prominent African American leader of the 20th century who made a dramatic shift from the political left to the right over a period of three decades. </p><p>Max Yergan: Race Man, Internationalist, Cold Warrior (2006, New York University Press) follows the course of Yergan's life against the backdrop of the complex political and institutional movements that have shaped African American history in the United States and abroad. </p><p>According to Anthony, Yergan was part of a generation of leading African American figures whose careers were made up of an impressive series of pioneering feats. Yergan was the first African American to do YMCA work in South Africa; he was a mentor of Govan Mbeki, who later achieved distinction in the African National Congress; he was one of the first African Americans to work as an adjunct lecturer at City College of New York; he was the second president of the National Negro Congress; and with Paul Robeson, he cofounded the International Committee on African Affairs. </p><p>But as author Adam Hochschild noted in a recent review of the book: "The multiple lives of the man David Anthony explores in these pages are fascinating, tragic, and remarkably little-known. The left to right journeys of many white American intellectuals are familiar, but the trajectory of this talented black man seems more dramatic than any of them--from mentor of a key African National Congress leader to enthusiastic backer of apartheid, from friend of Paul Robeson and target of FBI surveillance to someone eulogized in the National Review, Max Yergan's odyssey through the twentieth century is a prism through which to view an era's dreams and conflicts on four continents."</p><p>Anthony noted that Yergan's dramatic shift politically was the result of intense pressure due to Cold War hysteria. "It was a mix of personal disillusionment and intimidation once the government began pressuring radicals through the Smith Act, Truman Doctrine, and everything leading up to and culminating in McCarthyism," Anthony explained. "Yergan was one of the many casualties of the Cold War."</p><p>Anthony added that many elements of his new book are surprisingly timely. </p><p>"Yergan was a target of government surveillance for almost 30 years, from 1937 through the 1960s," Anthony said. "He was not rehired by City College in 1940 in the wake of an anti-left purge of radical academics by New York State legislators. And during his public life, the Army, Navy, State Department, and FBI all maintained extensive dossiers on Yergan's writings, speeches, comings and goings--this persisted well after he recanted leftism and became an outspoken critic of the left."  </p><p>The book took more than a decade of research, involving a series of Freedom of Information Act requests and numerous trips to southern Africa. Anthony also spent 10 months as a Fulbright Fellow, teaching and researching at the National University of Lesotho in Roma and made three field trips to South Africa as part of the African American Historical Linkages with South Africa project.</p><p>Anthony said the book had its origins as part of a study about men and women of African descent, whose interests in Africa led them to live there for significant periods of time. But he said he became increasingly intrigued with all of the twists and turns of Yergan's complicated life. "I never intended to work as long on this subject as I did," Anthony observed. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>David Anthony will present a book talk and reading at Capitola Book Café (1475 41st Ave., Capitola) on Tuesday, March 28, at 7:30 p.m. For more information about the event, call (831) 462-4415.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f94508072704601a012ffffc41ce4"><name>832</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC recirculates portion of Draft LRDP EIR's traffic section for public comment</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin/Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1142578800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC recirculates portion of...</display-name><path>/2006/03/832</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/832</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338165776</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338165776</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is recirculating additional traffic analysis for public comment as part of the Draft Environmental Impact Report related to the campus's proposed Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP). The recirculated analysis evaluates traffic conditions on sections of Highways 1 and 17, assuming full implementation of the LRDP. The additional traffic analysis is the only part of the Draft EIR that is being recirculated.</p>

"Based on comments we received during the public review period for the Draft EIR, we expanded the traffic/transportation analysis to include sections of Highways 1 and 17 and are recirculating that analysis for public comment," said campus architect Frank Zwart, associate vice chancellor for UCSC's Office of Physical Planning and Construction. "The earlier analysis considered vehicle 'trip' distribution on campus and City of Santa Cruz intersections associated with LRDP implementation," Zwart said, noting that the additional analysis examines freeway segments and interchanges on Highway 17, south of Granite Creek Road, and on Highway 1, between the 'Fishhook' and State Park Drive.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The additional traffic analysis is available for public review at three local libraries (the downtown branch of the Santa Cruz Library and UCSC's McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering Libraries). A printout may be purchased from Santa Cruz Fed-Ex Kinko's on Laurel Street in downtown Santa Cruz or on campus at XpressIt!, located next to the Bay Tree Bookstore. In addition, the document will be posted on the UCSC web site at <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu">lrdp.ucsc.edu</a> as a convenient option for those with access to a personal computer.</p>
<p>The 45-day comment period, which will begin on Monday, March 20, ends at 5 p.m. on May 3, 2006. Reviewers are requested to limit their comments to the materials contained in the recirculated document. Comments must be submitted in writing and received by UCSC before that deadline.

Arnold Schwarzenegger to overhaul the dysfunctional system, underscores the challenges facing would-be reformers, said Craig Haney, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"The governor took on this incendiary issue when his political capital was high, and the departure of his hand-picked champion of reform is a huge blow," said Haney.</p><p>Scathing media reports of overcrowding and mistreatment of inmates in the largest prison system in the country, coupled with high-profile court cases over prison conditions and abuse in a number of states, have triggered calls for prison reform in many parts of the country. "Prisons are intended to deprive inmates of their liberty," said Haney. "Anything more--unnecessary deprivations, indignities, and ill treatment--represents gratuitous pain and can have harmful psychological consequences."</p><p>In his new book, <i>Reforming Punishment: Psychological Limits to the Pains of Imprisonment</i> (Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association, 2006), Haney critiques the "fundamentally flawed prison policies" that have dominated U.S. prisons for much of the last 30 years, and he points the way to systemic reform. </p><p>Reform must be based on the results of decades of psychological research into the real causes of crime and the consequences of imprisonment, said Haney. "We now know a lot about why people commit crime, but prisons do nothing to address those issues--and may actually make them worse," he said. Exposing prisoners to overcrowded and inhumane conditions has adverse psychological consequences, and the effects can be long-lasting, said Haney.</p><p>With 2 million people in custody, the U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country, including unprecedented numbers of mentally ill and nonviolent prisoners, and a grossly overrepresentative number of minorities. Huge numbers of state and federal prisoners are nonviolent offenders, and many have been incarcerated for drug or drug-related crimes, said Haney. </p><p>"Our nation's overreliance on incarceration to control crime is doomed to fail," he said. "Spending so much on imprisonment siphons money away from the kind of crime-prevention programs we need."</p><p>Moreover, Haney points out, most inmates are eventually released, and far too many come out much worse off than when they went in. "Many incur severe psychological costs as they adapt to the dehumanizing effects of modern prison life," he said.</p><p>Prison-based rehabilitation, including educational, vocational, and counseling programs, would require upfront spending but would generate long-run benefits, said Haney. Incarceration rates average upwards of $30,000 a year per inmate, according to Haney, who said inmates also need a lot of community support and other kinds of help after their release to successfully reintegrate into society. </p><p>"Adverse conditions inside prisons and the absence of effective rehabilitation programs contribute to problematic behavior inside prison and dysfunctional behavior after release," he said. "As a society, we can't afford to pursue this wrongheaded approach much longer." </p><p>In the long run, prison reform would generate bottom-line savings as well as benefits to society, said Haney. Recidivism rates would drop, parole costs would decrease, and the prison system itself would shrink, he said. A fair and effective approach to crime control would require shifting resources from punishment to prevention and must address the social and economic injustices that punish the poor and people of color, said Haney. But prison reform will be crucial for the many people now locked inside, he said, identifying the following steps toward real reform:</p><p>	. Repeal mandatory sentencing laws to give judges more discretion over who goes to 	prison and for how long. </p><p>	. Develop alternatives to prison for the mentally ill, certain drug offenders, and those 	convicted of minor crimes.</p><p>	</p><p>	. Give all prisoners access to vocational, educational, and other forms of prison 	programming, as well as proper medical care.</p><p>	. Ensure that prisons adequately address the treatment needs of addicted, mentally ill, and 	developmentally disabled inmates.</p><p>. Improve overall conditions of confinement by reducing overcrowding and minimizing 	the use of psychologically destructive practices like punitive isolation.</p><p>	. Provide extensive postimprisonment assistance and community-based programs 	and services.</p><p></p><p>#####</p><p><i>One of the principal researchers in the landmark "Stanford Prison Experiment," Craig Haney has studied the psychological effects of living and working in actual prison environments for more than 30 years.

"Combining the disciplines of science, economics, and political science to address large-scale environmental problems is a very healthy and productive approach."</p><p>Keeley, a former executive director of the statewide Planning and Conservation League, has a long record of leadership on environmental issues. In the Assembly, he authored Proposition 12 and Proposition 40, the two largest environmental protection and park bond acts in the nation's history. Both were approved by voters, generating a combined $4.7 billion in bond funding for parks and environmental protection. Keeley also authored the Marine Life Management Act and coauthored the Marine Life Protection Act, major legislation that made significant policy changes in the management of California's coastal waters and marine environment.</p><p>In making the bequest, Keeley said, "The University of California is the leading research institution in the nation, and it needs as much support as it can get from as many sources as possible." He hailed the opportunities the STEPS Institute offers students to participate in environmental problem solving and said STEPS addresses his desire to "leave the planet somewhat better than I found it."</p><p>In 2003, in recognition of Keeley's contributions to education and environmental policy, the campus established the Keeley Lecture on Environmental Policy. The popular lecture series has so far brought former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich to campus. Hundreds of people turned out March 2 for Ehrlich's free lecture titled, "One with Nineveh: Politics, Consumption, and the Human Future."</p><p>"The Fred Keeley Lecture provides an annual forum for the community and the campus to come together and learn about environmental issues from outstanding guest speakers," said John Leopold, director of development for the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "The events have been very well received. This bequest will further benefit the people of California."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f98838072704601a012ff5776dbcf"><name>835</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC gene researcher Joshua Stuart awarded prestigious Sloan Research Fellowship</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>bioinformatics, microarrays</keywords><start-date>1143010800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC gene researcher Joshua...</display-name><path>/2006/03/835</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/835</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338166853</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338166853</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has selected Joshua Stuart, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as a Sloan Research Fellow. The prestigious two-year fellowship provides an award of $45,000 to support Stuart's research, which focuses on the development of computational tools for studying how genes work and identifying networks of genes involved in important biological functions. Ultimately, researchers can use these tools to explore the underlying genetic causes of human diseases and develop new therapies.</p><p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are intended to enhance the careers of the very best young faculty members in specified fields of science. Currently a total of 116 fellowships are awarded annually in seven fields, including computational and evolutionary molecular biology.</p><p>Stuart has done pioneering work on computer algorithms for analyzing the results of "microarray" experiments that probe the activities of thousands of genes simultaneously. His computer programs help researchers identify genes that work together and figure out the functions of different genes. These efforts are shedding light on the complex networks of interacting genes that orchestrate the activities of living cells. </p><p>"A lot of the work in my lab aims to get a view of what a gene does in the context of the whole network of genes that it interacts with," Stuart said. </p><p>His lab is involved in various collaborations with molecular biologists and geneticists at UCSC, Stanford University, and other institutions. A common theme throughout his work is the development of bioinformatics tools that are not only useful to his current collaborators, but can serve as a general resource for other researchers.</p><p>"I get satisfaction in seeing people share insights and use these resources for other purposes," Stuart said. "When we find a network of genetic interactions, it's like a big encyclopedia of links. So if you're a biologist, you can look up the gene you're interested in and see what other genes it interacts with."</p><p>The emergence of DNA microarray technology in the 1990s has led to an explosion in the amount of information scientists are able to gather about the activities of large numbers of genes in different kinds of cells and under different conditions. When scientists publish the results of a microarray experiment, they deposit the raw data into one of several publicly accessible databases, such as those maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). </p><p>According to Stuart, these databases are largely an untapped resource. A single microarray experiment generates an enormous amount of data. The researchers who conduct the experiments analyze the data to answer a particular question, but the raw data may hold answers to many other questions as well. Stuart is developing a variety of tools to make it easier for researchers to explore the databases and extract new information from them. </p><p>"Most molecular biologists will at some point use a microarray in their research, so the data are just pouring into the databases," he said. "Microarrays and similar technologies have launched biology into its own digital age, but we still need a search engine that allows us to tap into the richness of the data that's out there, like a Google for biological data." </p><p>One of Stuart's tools is a kind of search engine for gene activity data that was inspired by the online recommender systems used in e-commerce web sites. Movie recommenders, for example, suggest new movies a user might like based on the user's previous choices. Stuart's gene recommender is designed to help researchers studying the genes involved in a particular biological pathway, such as the series of molecular interactions that tell a cell when to stop growing. Researchers can submit a set of genes known to be involved in their pathway, and the search engine will generate a list of other genes ranked according to their probability of being involved in the same pathway.</p><p>Stuart's group tested the gene recommender on data from a common laboratory model for studying the retinoblastoma tumor pathway. They discovered two new genes involved in the pathway, representing new potential points of attack for therapies designed to block tumor formation. </p><p>"This is a pathway that people have been studying for 20 years, so for us to find two new genes is amazing. It's a very promising approach, but I think it is only one of many such tools that we will have in the future," Stuart said.</p><p>Stuart is affiliated with the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC. He is part of a growing group of researchers in the Baskin School of Engineering whose work crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves interactions with researchers in molecular, cell, and developmental biology and other fields outside of engineering. </p><p>Stuart earned a B.S. in computer science and B.A. in molecular, cell, and developmental biology from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a Ph.D. in biomedical informatics from Stanford University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Stuart at (831) 459-1344 or jstuart@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f9a178072704601a012ff0b88f804"><name>836</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Education forum April 5 explores links between schools, community</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>education, forum, glass, community, partnership, collaboration</keywords><start-date>1143010800000</start-date><display-name>Education forum April 5...</display-name><path>/2006/03/836</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/836</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338167258</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338167258</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Educators and parents seeking a model for education that's rooted in community and civic engagement will want to attend a free public forum on Wednesday, April 5, from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. The forum will take place in the Merrill College Cultural Center at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>Participants will describe several projects in which students in low-income, culturally and linguistically diverse neighborhoods benefited from links between their school and the broader community. Discussion will focus on ways that school-community connections empower students, enhance academic achievement, and energize democracy by building alliances and encouraging activism.</p><p>"School reform in this country has largely failed poor students and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds," said Ronald Glass, associate professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who is organizing the forum. "The focus on standards and testing ignores the conditions outside of school that make it difficult for kids to learn."</p><p>Such poverty-related factors as inadequate health and dental care, substandard housing, and poor nutrition make it difficult for many children to succeed, said Glass. "There's only so much schools can do, which is why we want to link school reform with broader community development issues," he said. "If we want to help low-income students, we need to help their parents."</p><p>Glass hopes to launch a project on the Central Coast that would engage parents, businesses, unions, students, teachers, churches, and community organizers. Forum attendees will learn about projects around the world that have integrated education, community, and democracy: </p><p>	Luis Gandin of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil, 	will describe the Workers' Party Citizen School experiment and the educational and 	political impacts of the construction of 70 schools in the city's poorest neighborhoods. </p><p>	</p><p>	Gustavo Fischman of Arizona State University will discuss the global Educative 	Cities movement, an effort to integrate all the cultural and educational spaces of 	cities, such as museums, parks, schools, and universities, in the service of 	advancing the poor.</p><p>	Pia Wong of California State University, Sacramento, and director of the Equity 	Network in Sacramento, will discuss the network's partnership with 12 professional 	development schools that serve poor immigrants from Laos, Mexico, and the 	Ukraine. She will discuss projects that involve parents, integrate garden-based 	science into the curriculum, and develop bilingual science curriculum around the 	health issues of the community: diabetes, heart disease, and drug and alcohol abuse.</p><p>	Pauline Lipman, director of the Institute for Teacher Development and Research at 	DePaul University, will discuss urban school reform in Chicago and the convergence 	of local and global economic and education policy forces that shape efforts to improve 	education and the capacity of teachers to make a difference for both students and 	communities.</p><p>Local educators will respond to the guest presentations and discuss themes within the context of the Central Coast region. The forum is being cosponsored by the Education Department and the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC). Opening remarks will be made by Glass, Rodney Ogawa, chair of the UCSC Education Department, and Manuel Pastor, codirector of CJTC and a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. Increasing parental involvement in educational policy making would help "energize" communities, said Pastor.</p><p>Noting the initial underrepresentation of Latinos in the recent debate over school closings in Santa Cruz, Pastor said, "Ultimately, many families were energized and did voice their concerns." Community schools could provide another bridge to greater engagement, especially if they provided English-language instruction to parents and others, said Pastor. "English is the biggest factor boosting economic outcomes," he noted. </p><p>Glass doesn't shy away from measuring the academic impact of community-based reforms on students in standard ways: by testing students and measuring drop-out and retention rates. Community impact could be gauged by evaluating measures of political engagement, such as voting rates. "We believe meaningful education improves test outcomes, while education that focuses strictly on test outcomes fails to be meaningful," he said.</p><p>The initiatives being launched by the symposium are "long-term and open-ended," said Glass. "It's a democratic process of bringing forces together in a way that makes sense for a particular community. It's not a top-down approach where the university dictates the scope of the project. This forum is an invitation to a conversation."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f9b858072704601a012ff315e4836"><name>837</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC chemist explores the membranous origins of the first living cell</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1143442800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC chemist explores the...</display-name><path>/2006/03/837</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/837</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338167637</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338167637</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Blowing bubbles is child's play, showing how easily soap molecules can assemble into a sheet and curl around to form a bubble. To David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and acting chair of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the formation of a soap bubble is no mere curiosity--it illustrates an essential property of the kinds of molecules that compose the membranes of all living cells. While other researchers debate whether DNA or proteins came first, Deamer traces the origin of life to microscopic bubblelike membranes.</p><p>"Membranous boundary structures define all life today," he said. "A source of membrane-bounded microenvironments on the early Earth was essential for the rise of cellular life."</p><p>Deamer has been investigating the origins of life for more than 20 years, with continuous funding from NASA's Exobiology and Astrobiology Programs. In the 1980s, he demonstrated that meteorites contain molecules capable of forming stable membranes. More recently, he has ventured from the laboratory into the field to test ideas about the kind of environment where life could have begun.</p><p>Charles Darwin, in a letter to his friend J. D. Hooker in 1871, speculated about life beginning in a "warm little pond." Many scientists, however, now believe that life may have begun in extreme environments such as undersea hydrothermal vents and volcanoes, with their abundance of chemicals and energy. While many scientists have attempted to test this hypothesis in the laboratory, Deamer was the first to do so in the field.</p><p>In June 2005, he led a team of scientists, including Russian geologist Vladimir Kompanichenko, to the Kamchatka region in eastern Russia, an area abounding in pools of water heated and sterilized by constant volcanic activity. Deamer carried with him a version of the "primordial soup"--a mixture of compounds like those a meteorite could have delivered to the early Earth, including a fatty acid, amino acids, phosphate, glycerol, and the building blocks of nucleic acids. Finding a promising-looking boiling pool on the flanks of an active volcano, he poured the mixture in and then took samples from the pool at various intervals for analysis back in the lab at UCSC.</p><p>The results were strikingly negative: life did not emerge, no membranes assembled themselves, and no amino acids combined into proteins. Instead, the added chemicals quickly vanished, mostly absorbed by clay particles in the pool. Instead of supporting life, the bubbling pool had snuffed it out before it began. Later, Deamer repeated the same experiment at Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California, with the same negative result.</p><p>What went wrong? The explanation is simple, said Deamer, who presented his findings in February at a meeting of the Royal Society of London. Conditions in geothermal springs and similar extreme environments just do not favor membrane formation, which is inhibited or disrupted by acidity, dissolved salts, high temperatures, and calcium, iron, and magnesium ions. Furthermore, mineral surfaces in these clay-lined pools tend to remove phosphates and organic chemicals from the solution.</p><p>"We have to face up to the biophysical facts of life," Deamer said. "Hot, acidic hydrothermal systems are not conducive to self-assembly processes. But these results serve to guide us to other possible sites that might be better choices."</p><p>A more benign environment for membrane formation, according to Deamer, would be a pool of relatively fresh water at moderate temperature ranges and with low acidity--something not very different from Darwin's "warm little pond." Next year, Deamer plans to find such a site near the Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii and repeat the experiment there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Deamer and postdoctoral researchers Sudha Rajamani and Sara Singaram continue to explore the formation of membrane structures and replicating molecules in the laboratory. Even the most rudimentary cell membrane is far more than a bag of chemicals, Deamer said. It provides a stable compartment for the chemicals inside to interact. It supplies energy needed for nucleic acids to replicate and proteins to be synthesized. It allows nutrients from outside to enter the cell and expels ions from the cell when necessary. Finally, it must be able to grow and divide.</p><p>"These are challenging requirements for life to emerge, but we can be optimistic," Deamer said. "The first cellular forms of life spontaneously overcame all these hurdles."</p><p>The cell membrane's stability and versatility come from a special quality of the molecules it is made from: one end of each molecule is soluble in water, while the other end is repelled by it. Dissolved in water at a sufficient concentration, such "amphiphilic" molecules (as chemists call them) can assemble into fluid-filled bubbles called "vesicles."</p><p>Deamer speculates that the first membranes were made of simpler chemicals than the complex molecules that form modern cell membranes. And he has shown that meteorites could have delivered simple amphiphilic molecules to the Earth.</p><p>"Amphiphilic molecules present in carbonaceous meteorites can form stable membranes," Deamer said. "They are also produced in laboratory simulations of volcanic conditions, so it seems very likely that such molecules were present on the early Earth, along with many other kinds of organic compounds. This is of immense significance to the origin of cellular life."</p><p>Nobody was present to witness the birth of life, but Deamer's findings suggest a scenario something like the following: Four billion or so years ago, comets, meteorites, and interplanetary dust were delivering organic compounds to the Earth at a rate thousands of times greater than what occurs today. Together with compounds produced by volcanic reactions, the organic material was deposited in the ocean and on land masses resembling present-day Iceland or Hawaii. The organic material, along with phosphate, accumulated in small pools fed by intermittent rain.</p><p>Nothing much happened for a while. The pools behaved like a million others, growing in the rain and drying out in the sun. But during each dry spell, the organic compounds became a thin film covering the surfaces of the lava rock, and this allowed reactions to occur that could not take place in the dilute solution. Amphiphilic molecules that had been dispersed in the water began to organize first into sheets, and then into microscopic vesicles that trapped some of the other chemicals inside them. </p><p>Most of the vesicles did not have properties that were conducive to further evolution, but a few had trapped just the right mix of chemicals--amino acids, nucleotides, phosphates, and sugars. Protected from the environment, the chemicals in the vesicles began to react with one another to produce long molecular strings resembling the nucleic acids and proteins found in modern cells. These, in turn, began to interact in ways that researchers don't yet understand, but the end result was a system of encapsulated molecules that could grow and make more of themselves. </p><p>At some point, the vesicles found a way not only to grow, but also to reproduce by dividing into two or more nearly identical yet smaller structures that we would now call living cells.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact David Deamer at (831) 459-5158 or deamer@soe.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f9cfe8072704601a012ffc84c9ea0"><name>838</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz and San Jose State team up on $1.4 million effort to boost reading and writing among fourth graders</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>reading, writing, education, scott, samway, vocabulary, research</keywords><start-date>1143442800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz and...</display-name><path>/2006/03/838</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/838</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338167985</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338167985</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nearly 1,000 fourth graders in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara Counties will participate in a three-year, federally funded educational research project that aims to improve student performance in reading, writing, and language development.</p><p>Judith A. Scott, an associate professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and chair of the doctoral program in language and literacy, will codirect the collaboration with Katharine Davies Samway, an education professor at San Jose State University. They received a $1.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to develop vocabulary-based techniques to enhance the writing, reading, and overall academic performance of students.</p><p>"Vocabulary knowledge is highly correlated with reading achievement and overall academic achievement," said Scott. "But research shows that old 'skill and drill' methods of teaching vocabulary are not very effective. This grant gives us the opportunity to work with local teachers to develop, implement, and assess new strategies."</p><p>"This type of research is extremely important in improving student performance. We need to help students acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in California classrooms," Scott said.</p><p>Local fourth-grade students who are native English speakers, as well as those learning English, will participate in the study. Scott and Samway, an expert in the needs of English-language learners and in writing instruction, will work with teachers on a "word consciousness" approach that emphasizes vocabulary and language in all subjects, including social studies, mathematics, science, and language arts. "Our goal is to infuse vocabulary development in a seamless manner that helps teachers and students cope with the language demands of schooling," said Scott.</p><p>"Word consciousness" fosters an awareness and understanding of how language works, as opposed to having children memorize lists of particular words. The project will emphasize the development of "word consciousness" in a student-centered approach to teaching writing. </p><p>"Academic success after third grade increasingly depends on students' ability to use academic language--as opposed to conversational language--in their writing," said Samway. "This is particularly important for English-language learners, who typically have less exposure to English at home."</p><p>This project builds on Scott's previous research, which indicated that students with teachers who focused on word consciousness were nearly twice as likely to use sophisticated words in writing samples as were students in the control groups. </p><p>Samway's research has focused on the literacy development of English-language learners. "Most teachers in California teach English-language learners, and it's essential that we help them identify practices that enhance their students' literacy and academic development," she said. </p><p>Anthony Villar, a research specialist at the UCSC New Teacher Center, will assess the effectiveness of the project's methods by analyzing student achievement in rigorous field tests in both counties.  </p><p>"The state of California spent $30.3 billion on K-12 education last year," said Scott. "That's 40 percent of the entire state budget. It makes sense to do research in schools to identify and develop educational practices that improve student learning."</p><p>#####</p><p></p><p><i>Editor's Note: Judith Scott may be reached at (831) 459-5066 or via e-mail at jascott@ucsc.edu.

As a litigator with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Los Angeles, Rice filed a landmark case on behalf of low-income bus riders that resulted in a mandate that more than $1 billion be spent to improve the bus system. In 1999, she launched a coalition lawsuit that won $750 million for new school construction in Los Angeles--money previously slated for less crowded, more affluent suburban school districts.

Laurie Zoloth, professor of medical ethics and humanities and of religion at Northwestern University, will give a talk entitled "May We Make the World? Bioethics, Stem Cells, and the New Biology," followed by a question-and-answer period. The event will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center on the UCSC campus.</p><p>Zoloth directs the Center for Bioethics, Science, and Society at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine. She is chair of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Bioethics Advisory Board, serves on the executive committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, and is a member of the NASA National Advisory Council, the nation's highest civilian advisory board for NASA. Her current projects include work on the emerging issues in medical and research genetics and on the ethical issues in stem cell research. </p><p>"She is a truly cross-disciplinary person, an expert in religious studies and medical ethics who also understands the culture of scientific research," said Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who invited Zoloth to speak at UCSC. </p><p>Ares and Ellen Suckiel, professor of philosophy and provost of Stevenson College, will both give brief introductory remarks. The event is sponsored by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) Stem Cell Training Program at UCSC; the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology; Stevenson College; the Department of Philosophy; the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering; and the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research. </p><p>The use of embryonic stem cells for research and, potentially, for medical therapies has been the subject of ongoing public debate. Many scientists believe that stem cell research has enormous potential to produce new therapies and cures for a wide range of diseases. The controversy centers around the use of donated human embryos as the source of embryonic stem cells. The embryos are disrupted in the process of taking stem cells from them, and this is unacceptable to those who consider a human embryo to have the same moral status as a person.</p><p>"These issues are among the deepest challenges we face today," Suckiel said. "We are called upon to arrive at social consensus regarding such big questions as the nature of what it is to be human, our obligations to others, the limits of human reproduction, and the value of scientific inquiry."</p><p>Progress in other areas of biotechnology and biological research raises similar ethical questions, she said. "Biotechnology will enable us to take progressively greater control over human nature itself--a project which calls not only for scientific brilliance but also for intense ethical sensitivity and reflection," Suckiel said.</p><p>Zoloth has explored many of these questions, including the ethical issues arising from the sequencing of the human genome. In addition to her public talk at UCSC, Zoloth will give a seminar in the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology and will meet with faculty and students. </p><p>"As we develop new technologies in the biological sciences, we continually run into new questions about whether it's 'okay' to do certain things," Ares said. "The people who are creating these technologies don't think very often about how the public perceives what they do, so getting this other perspective about biologically transforming technologies is really valuable." </p><p>UCSC was awarded a $1.2 million training grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) for an interdisciplinary group of faculty to establish a training program in stem cell research.

The project builds on earlier advances by UCSC researchers in optical and electrical sensing technologies and involves a broad interdisciplinary group of collaborators at UCSC and Brigham Young University. </p><p>Holger Schmidt, an associate professor of electrical engineering at UCSC, is principal investigator on the grant from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, which will provide $1.6 million over four years for the sensor project.</p><p>"We aim to develop a new type of instrument that can do both electrical and optical sensing of single biomolecules, with all the components of the sensor ultimately integrated onto a chip," Schmidt said. "This would be the first device to provide both electrical and optical characterization of single molecules."</p><p>Potential applications for the new device include highly sensitive testing for medical diagnostics. It could also be a powerful tool for basic research in molecular biology. </p><p>In 2004, Schmidt and his coworkers reported the first demonstration of integrated optical waveguides with liquid cores. This technology, using the principle of antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROW), enables light propagation through tiny volumes of liquids on a chip. Since then, Schmidt has continued to work with Aaron Hawkins of Brigham Young University to optimize the properties of the liquid-core optical waveguides for use in sensor devices. The new project involves the collaboration of two other scientists at UCSC: David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and acting chair of biomolecular engineering, and Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology. </p><p>Deamer has pioneered the development of nanopore devices for electrical sensing of single molecules. A nanopore is a tiny hole with dimensions on the order of nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). Passage of a molecule through the hole generates a characteristic electrical signal. The team plans to integrate nanopores and liquid-core optical waveguides into the new sensor platform. </p><p>"The nanopore will act as a smart gate for entry of individual molecules into the channel of the waveguide," Schmidt said.</p><p>Noller is a leading authority on ribosomes, complex biomolecular machines that are the protein factories in all living cells. The researchers will use the new sensor platform to study individual ribosomes in action.</p><p>"In the integrated sensor, we will be able to study the ribosome without the need to immobilize it, so we hope to gain new understanding of how the ribosome works," Schmidt said.</p><p>The collaboration brings together researchers from three different departments at UCSC: the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Biomolecular Engineering, both in the Baskin School of Engineering, and the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. </p><p>"This is a truly multidisciplinary collaboration," Schmidt said. "I am very excited about using integrated optics to investigate real problems in molecular biology."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Schmidt at (831) 459-1482 or hschmidt@soe.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fba5d8072704601a012ffc245274b"><name>843</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Husband of outed CIA operative Valerie Plame to headline teach-in at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1143702000000</start-date><display-name>Husband of outed CIA...</display-name><path>/2006/03/843</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/03/843</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338175535</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338175535</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph Wilson-the husband of outed CIA operative Valerie Plame-will be among the featured speakers at "The War on Terror: A Credible Threat," a daylong teach-in that will take place on Monday, April 24, at UC Santa Cruz in the Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p>The 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. public event will feature nationally known speakers for a day of reflection on U.S. international politics and university life. Guest speakers will include U.S. Representative Sam Farr; prominent law professors from UCLA, UC Berkeley, Columbia, and Georgetown University; Santa Cruz mayor Cynthia Mathews; and senior UC Santa Cruz faculty members. Chancellor Denton is also expected to attend and speak briefly. Admission is free.</p>
<p>Wilson is now at the center of a controversy involving the White House, the CIA, and the Iraq war. His wife's identity was disclosed after he asserted in a New York Times op-ed column that the administration twisted prewar intelligence to exaggerate the Iraqi threat from a nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>The teach-in is designed to address growing concern over warrantless searches of U.S. citizens, confirmed reports of torture in U.S.-controlled prisons, alleged violations of constitutional and international law in the war on terror, and the deteriorating situations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East. It was initiated by Faculty Against War-a group of 25 senior UC Santa Cruz faculty members-and a coalition of student organizations, including Students Against War (SAW).</p>
<p>"As educators, we feel an obligation to respond, and so we have chosen to respond with education," noted UC Santa Cruz politics professor Michael Urban, who spoke on behalf of Faculty Against War.</p>
<p>The idea for the event grew out of outrage at the Pentagon's spying on antiwar activities by students and a recent report in which UC Santa Cruz was characterized as being a "credible threat" to national security. Chancellor Denton challenged that designation with members of Congress, and it was subsequently removed from the Pentagon's database.</p>
<p>"This event is an effort to spark a national movement similar to the kind of effective teach-ins that were mounted in the 1960s and 1970s about the war in Vietnam," said feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker. The organizers aim to "provide a forum for those who want to consider what is being done in their names, and to inform the judgment and discretion of both the academic and civic communities," she added.</p>
<p>The list of speakers slated for the event includes:</p>
<p>. Richard Abel, Professor, UCLA School of Law</p>
<p>. Bettina Aptheker, UCSC Professor, Feminist Studies and History</p>
<p>. Maria Blanco, Executive Director, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco Bay Area</p>
<p>. Judith Butler, Professor, UC Berkeley Departments of Rhetoric, Comparative Literature, and Gender &amp; Women's Studies</p>
<p>. David Cole, Professor, Georgetown University School of Law</p>
<p>. Sam Farr, Member, U.S. House of Representatives</p>
<p>. Safaa J. Ibrahim, Council on American-Islamic Relations</p>
<p>. Cynthia Mathews, Mayor, City of Santa Cruz</p>
<p>. Eben Moglen, Professor, Columbia University School of Law</p>
<p>. Alan Richards, UCSC Professor, Economics and Environmental Studies</p>
<p>. Miguel Tinker-Salas, Professor, Pomona College, Latin American History</p>
<p>. Neferti Tadiar, UCSC Associate Professor, History of Consciousness</p>
<p>. Daniel Wirls, UCSC Professor, Politics</p>
<p>Major funding for the teach-in has been provided by the Offices of the Chancellor, Executive Vice Chancellor, and Student Affairs, with additional contributions from the Anthropology Department, Center for Cultural Studies, Center for Justice, Tolerance and Community (CJTC), College Nine, College Ten, Cowell College, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office, Feminist Studies Department, History Department, Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR), Institute for Humanities Research, Literature Department, Women's Center, the Santa Cruz Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and other campus and community organizations.
