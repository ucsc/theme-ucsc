<p>Fulbright scholars and professionals from around the world are being introduced to the United States-and English-in University Town Center downtown; youngsters on campus are perfecting their cheers and honing their computer skills; and the campus is playing host to a variety of academic conferences.</p>
<p>Of the 11,000 summer conference participants, 31 percent are attending pre-collegiate academic programs, 45 percent are in youth sports camps and 24 percent take part in adult conferences sponsored by UC Santa Cruz or professional associations.</p>
<p>"Our conferees always say they love our location," said Conference Services assistant director Martha Keeler. "The community is a great draw to them as well."</p>
<p>All this activity grosses more than $4 million for the campus during the 10-week season, June 25-September 2. Summer revenue keeps room and board rates down in residence halls and apartments during the regular academic year.</p>
<p>Summer is an especially busy time for UCSC Extension's English Language and International Programs Department. More than 14 Fulbright Scholars are enrolled in pre-academic orientation programs, and more than 30 Humphrey Fellows-midcareer professionals in a range of fields-receive a three-week crash course in American academia before heading off to campuses around the country. While there is a heavy emphasis on fine-tuning English skills, the program also eases participants into American culture. The students are matched with community mentors and some will take part in a community forum at the Louden Nelson Community Center on July 31 and in August to share information about their Humphrey projects and their home countries.</p>
<p>"Through their mentors, they meet different people in their fields and start a new network in the United States," said Susan Miller, director of English Language and International Programs.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Scholars represent a wide array of disciplines, and Humphrey Fellows include specialists in everything from journalism to HIV/AIDS policy and come from nations as varied as Bhutan, Tunisia, Brazil, Iraq, and Congo.</p>
<p>"The fellows always rave about their experiences here," Miller said.</p>
<p>Adding to the international atmosphere is a group of Mongolian government officials and a number of students from other Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan and Korea, all getting language and cultural education.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz also plays host to a number of academic conferences. New this year is <a href="http://www3.villanova.edu/conferences/biogeomon2006">Biogeomon,</a> a biogeochemical research conference co-sponsored by UCSC and Villanova University.</p>
<p>For the younger set, there are academic camps, cheerleading and sports camps, as well as a camp for aspiring rock musicians. Taking full advantage of UC Santa Cruz's location, the <a href="http://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech Camps</a> even offer a "Surf &amp; Tech" program where students spend half the day surfing and the other half in the lab creating a web site or video game.</p>
<p>For additional information, check the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/conference/">Conference Services website.</a></p>
<p>In between all the visitors' activity, UC Santa Cruz's summer session is well under way. The first summer session began June 26 and ends July 28. The second session runs July 31 to September 1, and there is also an intensive eight-week Spanish class, a seven-week course, 10-week courses, and independent field courses for undergraduates.</p>

The new major, leading to a B.S. degree, provides students with a rigorous background in the technical, artistic, and narrative elements of creating interactive computer games. </p><p>"We are pleased to be able to offer this new degree program, which provides a unique combination of technical and artistic training," said Ira Pohl, professor and chair of computer science in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>The Department of Computer Science will administer the new interdisciplinary program, which will also involve faculty in the Department of Film and Digital Media in UCSC's Arts Division. Students can enroll in the new major beginning this fall.</p><p>"Millions now play massively multiplayer online games, which constitute a new cultural force--a new medium. Digital media courses will provide students with the tools they need to understand this cultural transformation in conjunction with its technological and artistic possibilities," said Warren Sack, assistant professor of film and digital media.</p><p>A highlight of the major is a yearlong game design project in which students work in teams to develop and polish a substantial video game. The campus is creating a new instructional laboratory for computer game design to support these projects. </p><p>"Students will be able to turn their dreams of making computer games into reality," said James Whitehead, associate professor of computer science. "The yearlong project makes it possible to take a game concept and turn it into a fully functional game with high-quality gameplay, characters, and storyline. We want our students to break new ground and achieve excellence in game design. The yearlong project and fully stocked lab make this possible."</p><p>To help launch the program, UCSC has recently hired Michael Mateas, a leading researcher in the area of artificial intelligence for computer games. Mateas, an assistant professor of computer science, focuses on creating computer-controlled characters that have rich emotions, dialogue, and interactions with their environment. </p><p>Mateas is codeveloper of the game Façade, an interactive drama that represents a new genre of computer games. In Façade, the player is a friend of a couple having marital problems. The player "talks" to the couple (by typing), and they respond to the player and to each other. Whether they stay together or break up depends on what the player says. </p><p>"In making Façade, I wanted to create a new game-playing experience, where the player is truly immersed in the story and has nuanced interactions with the characters," Mateas said. "I look forward to teaching students how to use artificial intelligence techniques to create new kinds of game experiences."</p><p>The new major has a core of computer science courses and provides a rigorous education in the technical aspects of creating computer games. Additional courses in digital media permit students to focus on games from an artistic perspective. Electives permit students to explore relevant courses in art, theater, film, music, and economics. Pathways in the major permit students to transfer into it from community colleges. </p><p>Nationwide, there are only a handful of institutions offering technically focused undergraduate degree programs in computer games, Pohl said. In California, the University of Southern California is starting a similar degree this fall. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Georgia Institute of Technology have also both recently launched programs. </p><p>"Campus investment in computer science and engineering combined with a distinguished arts program, as well as the creative environment of Santa Cruz and the campus's connections with Silicon Valley, give us a tremendous advantage," Pohl said.</p><p>The program prepares students to take jobs in the computer games industry or to pursue graduate study in computer science, he said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Pohl at (831) 459-3648 or pohl@cs.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91500cd78072704601a012ff8dd1a8c6"><name>901</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC researchers use new technology to study Cape fur seals in South Africa</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1152601200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC researchers use new...</display-name><path>/2006/07/901</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/901</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338196614</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338196614</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sophisticated electronic tagging technology developed as part of the Tagging of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP) program is now being deployed to study Cape fur seals in South Africa. Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is currently in South Africa working with an international team of investigators to study the biology and feeding behavior of the Cape fur seal, the most important marine predator in the region.</p><p>"The point of this collaboration is to share new technologies and approaches that have been developed in association with the TOPP program," said Costa, a TOPP principal investigator overseeing the program's research on marine mammals and seabirds throughout the North Pacific.</p><p>In South Africa, Costa is working with John Arnould from Deakin University in Australia and Herman Oosthuizen and his colleagues from the Marine and Coastal Management unit of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in Cape Town, South Africa. The team traveled to a fur seal colony on the northwest coast of South Africa to conduct the study. The colony happens to be located in the middle of a diamond mine, which meant the researchers had to pass through stringent security to gain access to the site. </p><p>To understand the habitat needs of the Cape fur seal, the researchers want to find out where the seals feed and how much they eat. The Cape fur seal is currently one of the most abundant fur seals in the world. Researchers and conservationists would like to better understand the role of this top predator in the marine environment, and they would also like to make sure that appropriate protection is in place to assure that the population stays healthy. </p><p>"Our efforts are aimed at helping our South Africa colleagues understand the biology of this amazing animal before its population starts to get in trouble," Costa said. "We've seen many populations of sea lions and fur seals throughout the world become endangered or threatened. In South Africa, not only can we study an animal whose population is healthy, but we can lay the groundwork for conservation and management before there is a crisis."</p><p>With the support of a grant from the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, Costa and his collaborators have developed new tracking devices that use the Global Positioning System (GPS). These GPS tags allow researchers to follow the movements of marine mammals to within 30 feet of their real position. Previous tracking technology using ARGOS satellites could only give locations to within 500 feet, at best, and when used on seals at sea was usually only good to within a half mile or worse, Costa said.</p><p>In addition to the tracking technology, Arnould is deploying stomach-temperature telemetry tags that record when the animals consume prey such as fish or squid. This is based on the idea that seals, as warm blooded animals, have an internal body temperature higher than the temperature of their environment, and when they eat a fish that is the same temperature as the water their stomach temperature declines. UCSC graduate student Carey Kuhn recently validated this technique for use on sea lions and seals for her dissertation research, with support from TOPP and California Sea Grant.</p><p>The team is also interested in how hard the seals are working when they are at sea. They have deployed special heart-rate sensors that will record the seals' heart rates during swimming, diving, and other activities. This technology is based on the same heart-rate sensors that joggers and athletes use. </p><p>The oceanographic conditions off the west coast of South Africa are very similar to those off the California coast, which makes the area of particular interest to TOPP researchers, Costa said. In both locations, a cold-water current flows toward the equator, and winds cause nutrient-rich upwelling. </p><p>"These regions are ecologically very similar, with abundant marine mammals and seabirds, and they are among the most productive waters in the world for commercial fisheries," Costa said.</p><p>For more information on TOPP, visit the program's award-winning web site at <a href="http://www.toppcensus.org">http://www.toppcensus.org</a>.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Costa at costa@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91500fee8072704601a012ffc84d7f35"><name>903</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC scientists to discuss life on Earth in conjunction with world premiere of Frans Lanting's Life: A Journey through Time</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1152774000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC scientists to discuss...</display-name><path>/2006/07/903</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/903</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338197437</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338197437</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A scientific forum exploring advances in the understanding of life on Earth will take place on Monday, July 31, at 7 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.

Dynes announced today (July 14) the appointment of George Blumenthal as acting chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, effective immediately. Blumenthal, a UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics and a former chair of the UC systemwide Academic Senate, will assume on an interim basis the responsibilities of Chancellor Denice Denton, who died tragically on June 24.</p>
<p>Dynes made the appointment in accordance with UC policy and after consulting with members of the Board of Regents. The president will bring a recommendation for confirmation of <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/tenth_chancellor/">Blumenthal's acting appointment</a> to the Regents at their July 19-20 meeting.</p>
<p>To ensure a period of continuity for the Santa Cruz campus, Blumenthal is expected to serve as acting chancellor for much or all of the 2006-07 academic year. A national search for Chancellor Denton's permanent successor will be conducted over the course of that period and is expected to begin this fall.</p>
<p>"This has been a period of grief and sober reflection for UC Santa Cruz community, and for all of us in the extended University of California family, in the wake of Denice Denton's death," Dynes said. "For the next interim period, I am looking to George Blumenthal to provide for UC Santa Cruz the thoughtful, collegial, and constructive leadership that I have witnessed in his leadership of the systemwide Academic Senate.</p>
<p>"George is respected throughout the university, and he has more than 30 years of deep working knowledge of the Santa Cruz campus. I greatly appreciate his willingness to step in at this difficult moment. And I know that he, working with campus Provost David Kliger and the other talented members of the existing leadership team, will help the campus continue moving forward - which it absolutely must do."</p>
<p>Blumenthal, 60, has been a member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty since 1972. He has chaired the UCSC Astronomy and Astrophysics Department and the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate. In 2004-05 he served as chair of the UC systemwide Academic Senate, and he was faculty representative to the Board of Regents for the years 2003-05.</p>
<p>"This appointment is difficult because it has come about through such a tragic circumstance," Blumenthal said. "But I have enormous respect for the faculty, staff, and students of UC Santa Cruz, and I am honored to assume this responsibility.</p>
<p>"Over the past decade, UC Santa Cruz has been on a positive trajectory, moving upward among the top tier of our nation's universities. I am determined to continue that momentum. We shall increase the enrollment in our graduate and professional programs, while maintaining our uncommon commitment to undergraduate education. And our campus will remain committed to diversity and tolerance at all levels of the institution."</p>
<p>Blumenthal received his B.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and his Ph.D. in physics from UC San Diego. As a theoretical astrophysicist, Blumenthal's research encompasses several broad areas, including the nature of the dark matter which constitutes most of the mass in the universe, the origin of galaxies and other large structures in the universe, and the structure of active galactic nuclei such as quasars. Blumenthal also is a co-author of the astronomy text 21st Century Astronomy.</p>
<p>As acting chancellor, Blumenthal will receive an annualized salary of $260,000. In addition to salary, Blumenthal will receive standard pension and health benefits in accordance with UC policy.

Hutchison is a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Westermann is chair of international economic policy in the Department of Economics and Business Administration at the University of Osnabrueck, Germany.</p><p>The abrupt plunge of the Japanese economy, considered during the 1980s the "new economic powerhouse" of the global economy, provides a critical case study for other advanced industrialized nations, said Hutchison.</p><p>"In the 1980s, Tokyo was the center of the world, and there was no end in sight for growth," said Hutchison. "The industrial and economic power of Japan was considered unstoppable." </p><p>The book presents an in-depth discussion of the causes and effects of Japan's prolonged downturn by leading experts on the Japanese economy, including UCSC economics professor Kenneth Kletzer. The introduction by Hutchison and Westermann sets the stage for the chapters that follow.</p><p>They write that the stunning drop in the Japanese stock market on the last day of trading in 1989 signaled the beginning of a downturn that ushered in conditions as close to those of the Great Depression as any industrialized economy has faced since the 1930s. "No one saw it coming," said Hutchison. </p><p>No specific news triggered the stock market collapse--assets plunged more than 50 percent by 1992--but the drop, coupled with declining land prices and increasing unemployment, pushed the banking system to the brink of collapse. One precipitating factor was an unusual level of cooperation among government, banks, and industry in Japan known as the "iron triangle."</p><p>"The banking system was failing in every regard, and what was needed was a total overhaul of the regulatory structure," Hutchison said of a period marked by bank failures and the coining of the term "zombie banks" for institutions that were allowed to remain open despite shortages of capital. "Japanese bank regulators didn't have all the information they could have, and they hid or understated the information they did have, hoping the problem would go away." </p><p>Japanese policy makers reduced interest rates to zero, but the economy refused to budge: Banks were unable to make loans, investors lacked confidence, and the exchange rate plummeted. Faced with weak demand inside Japan, manufacturers turned to the United States, where a booming economy fueled the American appetite for Japanese exports, and China, where they sold goods and built factories.</p><p>Not until late 1997 did the Japanese government begin to make fundamental changes, stripping the Ministry of Finance of responsibility and establishing a separate regulatory agency, the Financial Services Agency. "They should have done that five years earlier," said Hutchison. </p><p>By contrast, the U.S. banking industry is heavily regulated and monitored. "Our own savings and loan crisis in the 1980s was resolved quickly because we took aggressive action, closed down bad banks, and paid off their loans," said Hutchison. Sweden's banking crisis in 1989 was resolved within 18 months by selling assets, mergers, and nationalizing some banks. </p><p>"What happened in Japan underscores how critical the financial system is to the workings of an advanced industrialized economy," said Hutchison. "The recession lasted twice as long as it would have because of the broken-down banking system."</p><p>"What had worked so well in Japan--decision making by consensus--became a problem because they couldn't reach consensus regarding how to handle the banking crisis," said Hutchison. "It had worked for years as a postwar development strategy that made Japan one of the richest countries in the world. But that policy impasse led to continued economic malaise and what we call the Great Stagnation."</p><p>Although monetary policy was sound--reducing interest rates was the right thing to do, noted Hutchison--the credibility of the policies was undermined by statements of officials, who failed to inspire confidence in the effectiveness of their own actions, said Hutchison. "They were very uncomfortable having rates so low, and they talked about it as a temporary measure," he said. "They should've acted decisively and with confidence to keep interest rates low."</p><p>The Japanese economy didn't emerge from the Great Stagnation until late 2005, noted Hutchison. "In modern societies, the banking system is critical to the smooth functioning of the economy," he said. "We take that for granted because it usually works so smoothly. But when it doesn't, the economic costs can be enormous."</p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: Michael Hutchison can be reached via e-mail at hutch@ucsc.edu.

For all practical purposes, physicists can and do ignore the bizarre implications of the theory and use the equations of quantum mechanics to understand atoms and stars and to create the marvels of modern technology, from computers to flat-screen televisions. But the strangeness of quantum theory remains an enigma at the heart of modern physics. </p><p>In a new book, <i>Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness</i> (Oxford University Press, July 2006), physicists Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner of the University of California, Santa Cruz, present a clear exposition and entertaining discussion of the baffling mysteries of quantum physics. Their motivation, in part, was to counteract the irresponsible distortions of quantum physics that are often used to support pseudoscientific claims, as in the recent movie "What the [Bleep] Do We Know!?"</p><p>"Things like that movie upset me, but this is not a debunking book," said Rosenblum, a professor emeritus of physics at UCSC. "A mystery in quantum physics indeed hints at some really wild stuff. The problem is that a layperson can't tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins."</p><p>Physicists have a responsibility, he said, to be more open and honest about the quantum enigma, which has been called the skeleton in the physicist's closet. When Kuttner and Rosenblum proposed a course for nonmajors on the quantum enigma, one colleague told them that "presenting this stuff to nonscientists is the intellectual equivalent of allowing children to play with loaded guns." They said they'd teach gun safety, and it's now the most popular course in the department, Rosenblum said.</p><p>The book presents the quantum enigma in nontechnical terms--no scientific background is needed to grasp the essential mystery. The aim is to give readers a sound basis for evaluating the various interpretations that have been proposed (all of them unsettling in one way or another) and to engage in their own speculations. The issues raised are more philosophical than technical.</p><p>"The quantum enigma rears up at a boundary of the physics discipline, and beyond this boundary, a physicist flounders just like the next guy," Rosenblum said.</p><p>Both Rosenblum and Kuttner have spent much of their careers in industry, using quantum mechanics in their daily work. They note that one-third of the nation's economy involves products based on quantum mechanics.</p><p>"Physicists can use quantum mechanics and calculate with it beautifully, but nobody understands it," said Kuttner, now a lecturer in physics at UCSC.</p><p>The encounter with consciousness referred to in the book's subtitle arises in the classic quantum experiments in which physicists found that they could demonstrate contradictory things. An atom or a molecule can be shown to be in two places at once. That's hard enough to believe by itself, but the same atom or molecule can also be shown to be in just one place. Looking for it causes it to be in a single place, so that what is observed depends on decisions made by the observer. And what is true for atoms and molecules is, in principle, also true for baseballs and cats, Rosenblum said.</p><p>The mystery does not emerge from quantum theory, but arises directly from the experiments. Quantum theory provides an explanation of sorts, in the form of equations that can be used to predict experimental results with unfailing accuracy. The theory is consistent with the experiments, but it conflicts dramatically with our sense of reality.</p><p>The book presents nine current interpretations of the quantum enigma (which physicists often refer to as the "measurement problem"). They range from the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation (which has been summarized as "shut up and calculate!") to the mind-boggling many-worlds interpretation. The authors do not endorse a favorite, but they do point out that each interpretation either involves consciousness or tries to evade the encounter so that physics need not deal with it.</p><p>"As far as what's really going on in the world, I don't have a clue, except that it's much stranger than we once thought, and somehow consciousness seems to be involved," Kuttner said.  </p><p>Many years ago, when Rosenblum was a graduate student, he and a fellow student got to spend an evening with Albert Einstein, who tried to discuss the enigma of quantum mechanics with them. But they were ill-prepared. </p><p>"Our advanced courses in quantum mechanics taught us how to calculate, but avoided the  mystery. Our ignorance of it disappointed Einstein," Rosenblum said. "The missed opportunity of that evening is one of the motivations behind this book. Physics courses still avoid presenting the quantum enigma. We would like to see our book used as collateral reading in such courses."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Notes to reporters and editors:</b> </p><p>For review copies of this book, contact Darren Shannon at Oxford University Press at (212) 726-6075 or darren.shannon@oup.com.</p><p>Reporters may contact Rosenblum at (831) 459-2326 or brucero@ucsc.edu and Kuttner at (831) 459-2061 or fkuttner@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915015cb8072704601a012ffec006f63"><name>907</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Atomic-resolution structure of a ribozyme yields insights into RNA catalysis and the origins of life</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1153378800000</start-date><display-name>Atomic-resolution structure of a...</display-name><path>/2006/07/907</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/907</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338198943</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338198943</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Which came first, nucleic acids or proteins? This question is molecular biology's version of the "chicken-or-the-egg" riddle. Genes made of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) contain the instructions for making proteins, but enzymes made of proteins are needed to replicate genes. For those who try to understand how life originated, this once seemed an intractable paradox.</p><p>The solution came with the discovery 20 years ago that certain types of RNA can act as enzymes, catalyzing reactions just as enzymes made of protein do. This means, in principle, that a single type of molecule, RNA, might be able to both encode information and replicate it. The idea that the first self-replicating molecules in a pre-biotic primordial soup were composed of RNA, known as the "RNA World" hypothesis, is one of the central tenets upon which many theories of the origin of life are now based.</p><p>Research on the structure and function of RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, has been one of the main activities in the Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as many other laboratories throughout the world. In addition to offering glimpses into how life may have originated, ribozymes are also being engineered in many academic and industrial laboratories to be therapeutic agents for potential use in fighting infectious and chronic diseases.</p><p>Scientists at UCSC's RNA Center have now obtained a near-atomic resolution image of the three-dimensional shape of a very simple--and therefore potentially understandable--ribozyme in which the atoms are uniquely arranged and poised for catalysis in the context of an intricately twisted and folded segment of RNA. The new findings are described in a paper by graduate student Monika Martick and her adviser, William Scott, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, in the July 27 issue of the journal Cell. The paper will be available online on July 20 at http://www.cell.com. </p><p>Using the technique of macromolecular x-ray crystallography, Martick and Scott were able to obtain a three-dimensional picture of the spatial arrangement of the several thousand atoms that comprise the ribozyme, known as the hammerhead ribozyme. The resulting color-coded structure was recently featured on the cover of the abstract book for the annual meeting of the RNA Society held in Seattle in early June.</p><p>"The structure illustrates unambiguously how functional groups of the RNA mediate acid-base chemical catalysis, permitting us to suggest that acid-base chemistry is so fundamental to enzyme catalysis that it predates the origin of protein enzymes," Scott said.</p><p>For Scott, these results are the culmination of 19 years of research on the structure of the hammerhead ribozyme. He started work on the project as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1987, a few months after the ribozyme was discovered. Later, as a postdoctoral researcher at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, he achieved his first breakthrough.</p><p>Scott subsequently built an internationally-recognized research team at UCSC that has performed static and time-resolved experiments resulting in the first crystallographic time-lapse "movie" of ribozyme catalysis. His group has also elucidated structures of other RNAs, including the recent structure of a highly conserved motif from the SARS virus genome.</p><p>Scott's structural observations of the hammerhead ribozyme, however, could not explain a growing number of biochemical experimental results. The hammerhead ribozyme has been the subject of intensive investigations by researchers around the world, and Scott found his most cherished accomplishments called into question.</p><p>"In 2002, I had two very lucky breaks," he said. "The first was that I learned of a new form of this ribozyme that was 1,000 times faster than the most widely studied form. The second was that an exceptionally talented graduate student, Monika Martick, joined my research group." </p><p>The faster form includes an extended sequence of RNA building blocks that researchers had previously neglected to study. Martick and Scott set to work on this newly discovered form of the ribozyme, achieving a breakthrough in March after four years of experiments. </p><p>"Monika e-mailed me from the Stanford Synchrotron at 3 a.m. to show me the most beautiful electron density map I had ever seen," Scott said. "I was so amazed I probably didn't sleep for the next three weeks." </p><p>The new results explained the earlier discrepancies in a way that reconciled them with the previous 11 years of Scott's experiments, he said. </p><p>"Seldom do scientific research projects have this sort of fairy tale ending. It has been extremely rewarding as well as humbling," Scott said.</p><p>The RNA Center at UCSC was immensely helpful, providing support that was instrumental to the group's success, he added. Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology and director of the RNA Center, has assembled a world-class team of investigators that includes two members of the National Academy of Sciences and two Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators.  </p><p>"It is very inspiring to work with this collective concentration of talent," Scott said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Scott at wgscott@ucsc.edu and Martick at martick@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915017218072704601a012ff377a496e"><name>908</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alison Galloway named vice provost of academic affairs at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin (831) 459-5190; emirwin@ucsc.edu or Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>galloway, academic, appointment, regents, provost</keywords><start-date>1153378800000</start-date><display-name>Alison Galloway named vice...</display-name><path>/2006/07/908</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/908</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338199276</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338199276</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alison Galloway, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named vice provost of academic affairs at the Santa Cruz campus.

In the post, which Galloway has held on an interim basis since last August, Galloway will work with the Academic Senate on two fronts: coordinating campuswide academic planning, program development, implementation, and review, and coordinating policies affecting faculty, including personnel actions, faculty diversity, and the development of senior leadership from within the campus community.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"It is a delight to announce that Professor Galloway has been approved to hold this key administrative post," said UCSC Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal, who served with Galloway as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Academic Senate. "She is highly regarded by faculty and is widely recognized as an engaged and effective leader with strong collaborative and administrative abilities. She will provide excellent leadership, and I look forward to working together to move the Santa Cruz campus forward."</p>
<p>Galloway, former chair of the Academic Senate, replaces George Brown, a professor of physics, who resigned as vice provost of academic affairs effective July 1, 2005. Her annual salary is $160,000, plus $5,000 to reimburse research expenses. A half-time graduate student researcher will support Galloway's research while she serves as vice provost.</p>
<p>"The campus is poised to take some major steps so this is an exciting time to be involved in the academic planning," said Galloway. "We face a number of hurdles, but we also have great faculty, staff, and students upon whom we are staking our reputation. I am looking forward to working with them to realize our aspirations."</p>
<p>Galloway is a physical anthropologist whose research focuses on human evolution and human skeletal biology. As one of the nation's leading forensic anthropologists, she regularly analyzes forensic evidence and provides expert witness testimony. She joined the UCSC faculty as an assistant professor in 1990 and was promoted to professor in 2001. She graduated with honors from UC Berkeley in 1975, earned her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in anthropology from the University of Arizona in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1988.</p>
<p>Galloway served as chair of the Academic Senate from 2003 to 2005 and vice chair of the Academic Senate and chair of the Anthropology Department from 2001 to 2003. During Galloway's tenure as vice chair, the position was revised by then-chair Blumenthal to give the vice chair much wider exposure to campus finances, organization, and planning. She previously served on the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching, Committee on Faculty Welfare, and Committee on Planning and Budget.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915018988072704601a012ff32de0dc0"><name>909</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A simple survey yields a cosmic conundrum</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1154329200000</start-date><display-name>A simple survey yields...</display-name><path>/2006/07/909</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/909</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338199655</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338199655</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A survey of galaxies observed along the sightlines to quasars and gamma-ray bursts--both extremely luminous, distant objects--has revealed a puzzling inconsistency. Galaxies appear to be four times more common in the direction of gamma-ray bursts than in the direction of quasars.</p><p>Quasars are thought to be powered by accretion of material onto supermassive black holes in the centers of distant galaxies. Gamma-ray bursts, the death throes of massive stars, are the most energetic explosions in the universe. But there is no reason to expect galaxies in the foreground to have any association with these background light sources.</p><p>"The result contradicts our basic concepts of cosmology, and we are struggling to explain it," said Jason X. Prochaska, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Prochaska and graduate student Gabriel Prochter led the survey, which used data from NASA's Swift satellite to obtain observations of the transient, bright afterglows of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). They described their findings in a paper accepted for publication in <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters.</i> The paper, which could have strange cosmological implications, has been a source of significant debate among astronomers throughout the world.</p><p>The study is based on a fairly straightforward concept. When light from a GRB or a quasar passes through a foreground galaxy, the absorption of certain wavelengths of light by gas associated with the galaxy creates a characteristic signature in the spectrum of light from the distant object. This provides a marker for the presence of a galaxy in front of the object, even if the galaxy itself is too faint to observe directly. </p><p>Prochter and Prochaska analyzed 15 GRBs in the new study and found strong absorption signatures indicating the presence of galaxies along 14 GRB sightlines. They had previously used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine the incidence of galaxies along the sightlines to quasars. Based on the quasar study, they would have predicted only 3.8 galaxies instead of the 14 detected along the GRB sightlines.</p><p>The quasar analysis was based on more than 50,000 SDSS observations, so the data for quasars are much more robust statistically than the data for GRBs, Prochaska said. Nevertheless, the probability that their results are just a statistical fluke is less than about one in 10,000, he said.</p><p>The researchers examined three potential explanations for the inconsistency. The first is obscuration of some quasars by dust in galaxies. The idea is that if a quasar is behind a dusty galaxy it wouldn't be seen, and this could skew the results. "The counter argument is that with this huge database of quasar observations, the effect of dust has been well characterized and it should be minimal," Prochter said.</p><p>Another possibility is that the absorption lines in the GRB spectra are from gas ejected by the GRBs themselves, rather than from gas in intervening galaxies. But in nearly every case when researchers have taken a closer look in the direction of the GRB, they have in fact found a galaxy at the same position as the gas.</p><p>The third idea is that the intervening galaxy may act as a gravitational lens, enhancing the brightness of the background object, and that this effect is somehow different for GRBs than for quasars. Although Prochaska said he prefers this explanation, several factors make strong lensing of the GRBs seem unlikely. </p><p>"Those who know more about gravitational lensing than I do tell me it's unlikely to be the answer," Prochaska said.</p><p>The paper, a draft of which has been posted on an Internet server for several weeks, has stimulated widespread discussion and at least one new paper proposing a potential explanation. But so far the findings remain perplexing.</p><p>"A lot of people have been scratching their heads, and most hope that it goes away," Prochaska said. "The GRB sample is small, so we would like to triple or quadruple the number in our analysis. That should happen during Swift's extended mission, but it will take time."</p><p>In addition to Prochaska and Prochter, the authors of the paper include Hsiao-Wen Chen of the University of Chicago; Joshua Bloom and Ryan Foley of UC Berkeley; Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky of the Geneva Observatory; Sebastian Lopez of the University of Chile; Max Pettini of Cambridge University; Andrea Dupree of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; and Puragra GuhaThakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>Data used in this study were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini Observatory, the Very Large Telescope at the Paranal Observatory, and the Magellan Observatory. Support for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation and NASA.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Prochaska at (831) 459-2135 or xavier@ucolick.org.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91501a658072704601a012ff943a0e20"><name>912</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Regional equity movement is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, say authors of Ford Foundation report</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>planning, equity, region, pastor, CJTC, Ford, movement</keywords><start-date>1154329200000</start-date><display-name>Regional equity movement is...</display-name><path>/2006/07/912</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/912</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338200082</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338200082</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Across the country, many urban neighborhoods and entire regions are segregated as surely as if there were "whites only" signs posted. But leaders of the new "regional equity" movement are organizing to break down the divisions of race, income, education, and employment that cut off opportunity and polarize Americans.</p><p>A new Ford Foundation report outlines an ambitious action plan for social change from Los Angeles to Detroit and Atlanta. The report, "Edging Toward Equity: Creating Shared Opportunity in America's Regions," is issued as a call to action by a team of academics, community activists, labor organizers, and foundation representatives brought together by the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Far more than a planning tool, regional equity has emerged over the past decade as a framework that combines economic competitiveness and fairness to rethink the landscape of cities and metropolitan areas.</p><p>"Regional equity represents new promise for the nation as a whole," said project coordinator Manuel Pastor, director of the CJTC and a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz. "Regional equity isn't just about being fair. It's about building a better America."</p><p>Just as the 1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles exposed that city's racial and economic fault lines, Hurricane Katrina laid bare the depths of concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and isolation experienced by many residents of New Orleans and the greater Gulf Coast. Without private vehicles or access to public transit, Katrina's most impoverished victims were effectively trapped in their devastated city while millions watched the suffering on television.</p><p>Proponents of regional equity blame widespread spacial inequality on a combination of public policy and market forces, and they call on policy makers, elected officials, and community activists to take a regional approach to economic growth so that all residents will benefit. </p><p>Pragmatic strategies include innovations such as Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs), which ensure that residents of neighborhoods slated for major regional attractions receive specific benefits. Developers of the Staples Center arena in Los Angeles, for example, negotiated with community organizers, who agreed not to oppose the project in exchange for benefits such as hiring preferences for neighborhood residents, development of a job-training academy at a local community college, and creation of a housing fund to help residents cope with the pressures of increased demand that accompany new development. Similar agreements were struck during the planning of the Los Angeles International Airport expansion, noted Pastor. "The idea is to bring the costs and benefits of development into alignment," he explained. </p><p>In another example of an equitable approach to urban planning issues, the "Fix it First" road program in Detroit diverted funds from building new roads to repairing old ones in an attempt to improve the city's infrastructure rather than enhance the suburban experience. </p><p>The fates of poor inner-city areas are increasingly intertwined with older outer suburbs that face similar problems of disinvestment and decline: in the 1990s, poverty rates in central cities actually declined while they rose in the nation's suburbs. Although cities and housing markets remain racially segregated, more African Americans and Latinos are living in suburbs than ever before, according to the report.</p><p>Regional equity strategies focus on addressing inequality in transportation, employment, housing, and environmental protection, but it is not just about helping the poor. Unbalanced and sprawling growth undermines economic efficiency and competitiveness, said Pastor, an economist who cited numerous studies that indicate that regions addressing such inequalities--from San Jose to Boston--are experiencing greater prosperity than those that ignore the problems. In Charlotte, North Carolina, city leaders recognized that their dream of becoming the "center of the New South" would never become reality if they didn't address the needs of the city's poor black population, noted Pastor. "The business community is embracing regional equity because workers in the new economy care tremendously about quality of life, and they don't want to live in cities with large populations of disenfranchised residents," he said. </p><p>The regional equity movement has "taken off" around the country in part because people respond to its core value of fairness, said Pastor. "People know polarization is wrong," he said. "They know it feels hurtful, and they are tired of growing apart. Regional equity promotes an idealistic vision of America's promise." </p><p>#####</p><p>Note to journalists: Manuel Pastor can be reached at (831) 459-5919 or via e-mail at

UC Santa Cruz Colleagues:</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of congratulations and support that I have received since the announcement of my appointment as UCSC's Acting Chancellor. I am truly honored to serve in this capacity.</p>
<p>This past month has been a difficult time for our campus, as we have dealt collectively and individually with the shock and grief of Chancellor Denton's untimely death. Denice Denton was a noted scholar, a generous mentor, a relentless fighter for diversity and tolerance, and a pioneer as a university leader. I urge us all to remember her many achievements. In her honor, UCSC has established a Denice D. Denton Memorial Fund (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/denice_denton/memorial_fund.asp">http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/denice_denton/memorial_fund.asp</a>), to support efforts to achieve Chancellor Denton's vision of excellence and diversity.</p>
<p>Today is my first day in the Chancellor's office. I am eagerly looking forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead. In the coming weeks, I expect to learn more about the issues that are front and center on the campus's agenda, while continuing to address UCSC's long-term priorities. Working with UCSC's superb leadership team and with the Academic Senate, I expect to make decisions and take actions that will continue the impressive progress that has characterized our campus during the past decade.</p>
<p>Our primary mission as an institution is to serve the State of California through teaching, research, and public service. Therefore, the priorities on which I will focus include:</p>
<p>* Recruiting and retaining the outstanding faculty, staff, and students that characterize our campus;</p>
<p>* Building on our academic strengths as we refine and implement our academic plan;</p>
<p>* Expanding graduate programs and enrollments, and considering the creation of additional professional schools;</p>
<p>* Maintaining our distinction and achievements as an outstanding undergraduate institution;</p>
<p>* Ensuring diversity among all segments of the university;</p>
<p>* Building positive relationships with the local community and community leaders; and</p>
<p>* Spreading the word about our campus's distinctions to various groups around the State and the country.</p>
<p>Meaningful and open communication is important to me. The Chancellor's web site soon will include a link inviting your ideas and comments. I welcome hearing from you. Although I won't be able to answer each note, I am committed to reading each and every one of your messages. I also plan to have discussions with groups of faculty, staff and students in a variety of venues.</p>
Again, thank you for your expressions of support. I am committed to working closely with the faculty, staff, and students as we face the challenges ahead. Together, we can continue building our university in which we all take enormous pride.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Colleagues</audience><admin>Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a278bc898072704601a012ff392fc6ef"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626075745</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626075745</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
