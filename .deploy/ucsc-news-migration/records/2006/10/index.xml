His pledge of $350,000 establishes the Olga T. Griswold Chair in Environmental Studies, which will focus on environmental stewardship, conservation, and restoration. </p><p>"We are delighted to be singled out for this honor, which comes at a time when land-use issues are at the forefront of public policy discussions in central California," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. </p><p>Griswold's gift will support a professor whose research and teaching focuses on issues of environmental stewardship in the state of California, with special emphasis on management and public policy. Griswold chose to make the gift to UCSC because of the campus's leadership in environmental conservation and restoration. UCSC faculty are involved with open-space preservation, water conservation, and landscape restoration efforts in the greater Central Coast region.</p><p>"My grandparents on both sides of my family vacationed in Santa Cruz from the early 1900s," said Griswold, a fourth-generation farmer and rancher whose cattle ranch near Cambria includes a mile of coastline. "We have many photographs depicting memorable moments camping there, visiting the boardwalk, and playing on the beach."</p><p>Olga Griswold was an avid gardener who did more than share her love of nature with her children. She fostered in them a stewardship ethic that's evident today on Griswold's ranch, where he is eradicating nonnative invasive weeds and protecting habitat for endangered red-legged frogs discovered on the property. "My mother had a particular love of frogs," noted Griswold.</p><p>The Griswold family has a long association with the University of California, with many family members graduating from UC campuses, including Griswold's nephew, Luke, who graduated from UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91505b728072704601a012ff5ba831e5"><name>955</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum features a wide variety of plants at the annual Fall Plant Sale on Saturday, October 14</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Arboretum</keywords><start-date>1159772400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum features a...</display-name><path>/2006/10/955</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/955</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338216767</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338216767</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum will hold its annual Fall Plant Sale on Saturday, October 14, from noon to 4 p.m. It will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection of Western Drive. Held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, the sale opens early (from 10 a.m. to noon) for members only. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.  </p><p>Fall is a good time for planting because roots can establish themselves during the rainy season, which makes for a stronger and healthier plant to withstand the dry summer. The sale will highlight an unusual selection of native and nonnative species chosen to thrive in home gardens. A complete list will be available on the Arboretum's web site (<a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">http://arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>) before the sale. </p><p>Featured plants include some lesser-known members of the protea family: Australian banksias with large, conelike flowers and South African leucadendrons with attractive foliage that can take on a yellow or burgundy-red color. There will also be a variety of manzanitas and other California natives.  </p><p>The sale will also include a variety of South African succulents, perfect plants for dorm rooms as well as the home garden, according to Stephen McCabe, research and education coordinator at the Arboretum. Several species of <i>Dudleya</i> (live-forevers) from California and Baja California will be available, including <i>Dudleya viscida,</i> a California native succulent recently highlighted in an article by McCabe in the <i>Rock Garden Quarterly</i> (Summer 2006).</p><p>One of the more unusual plants available this year is <i>Coreopsis gigantea,</i> which is native to California's Channel Islands. This plant's bright yellow daisylike flowers and finely divided leaves sit atop a woody, semisucculent trunk that can be four inches wide and more than six feet high. Other plants at the sale include <i>Salvia</i> 'Phyllis' Fancy,' a selection introduced by the Arboretum and featured in the September issue of <i>Horticulture</i> magazine.</p><p>For more information, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </p><p> </p><p>_____</p><p><b>Images</b> of plants available at the sale can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91505cf98072704601a012ffeadcff29"><name>956</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Living Writers Series' begins October 4 at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1159858800000</start-date><display-name>'Living Writers Series' begins...</display-name><path>/2006/10/956</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/956</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338217162</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338217162</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Humanities Division's "Living Writers Series" kicks off this fall quarter on October 4 with a presentation by poet Joshua Clover, a widely published critic and journalist, a frequent contributor to the New York Times, and the poetry editor for the Village Voice Literary Supplement.</p>
<p>Clover is one of many authors and poets who will appear at UCSC this academic year as part of the annual series coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita--codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program. The presentations are sponsored by the campus's Institute for Humanities Research, Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund, and the Literature Department.</p>
<p>"The series this fall is particularly exciting because we have several alumni reading--Cole Swensen, winner of a Guggenheim; Heather Nagami, a just-published poet; and Noria Jablonski, who recently published her first book of short stories," said Perks. "Another writer I'm really excited about is Kate Moses, who wrote the prize-winning, beautiful, and disturbing book, Wintering, about Sylvia Plath. We have a great mix of both established and young writers."</p>
<p>All of the readings will take place on Wednesday evenings from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Kresge College Town Hall, Room 466. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>"As always, UCSC's Bay Tree Bookstore will be selling the authors' books at a discount at the readings," Perks added. "They have been wonderful partners in this series."</p>
<p>Clover's work has been anthologized in American Poets in the 21st Century and American Poetry: Next Generation, and his poems have been chosen three times for inclusion in the annual Best American Poetry series. The author of two poetry books, The Totality for Kids, and Madonna anno domini-which earned him the 1996 Walt Whitman Award-Clover is also the recipient of two Pushcart Prizes and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

The Packard Fellowship, worth a total of $625,000, is one of the nation's most prestigious honors for young faculty members.</p><p>Rockosi will receive $125,000 per year for the next five years to support her research on the structure of the Milky Way galaxy. The Packard Foundation awards these fellowships to young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity.</p><p>Rockosi is interested in the old, distant stars in our galaxy and the clues they hold to the early history of the galaxy's formation. She is coleader of a team of astronomers exploring the structure of the Milky Way galaxy in a project called the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). The SEGUE survey--part of SDSS-II, an extension of the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey--is mapping the positions of tens of millions of stars and measuring their motions and chemical abundances. </p><p>"The Milky Way is a pretty typical spiral galaxy, so we can study our own galaxy to learn about galaxies in general and how they formed," Rockosi said. </p><p>She plans to use the Packard Fellowship to support a new project that will build on the data obtained from SEGUE. Using adaptive optics technology on the Shane 3-meter telescope at UC's Lick Observatory, she will observe selected stars from the SEGUE survey and combine the data from Lick and SEGUE to obtain a complete, 3-dimensional picture of how the stars are moving through the galaxy. This information will enable Rockosi to use the velocities of individual stars and substructures within the galaxy to map its overall size and shape and shed light on its history.</p><p>Streams of stars in the Milky Way have been identified as remnants of small companion galaxies that collided and merged with the larger galaxy. Many such mergers are thought to have taken place over the lifetime of the galaxy and are still taking place today. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, for example, is in the process of merging with the Milky Way, and spectacular streams of stars stripped away from Sagittarius by its gravitational interaction with the Milky Way have been traced over much of the sky by previous surveys. </p><p>Evidence of much older mergers should still be detectable in the form of coherent streams of old stars moving through the galaxy, even if obvious structures can no longer be seen, Rockosi said.</p><p>"We are looking for groups of stars all moving with the same motion relative to the rest of the galaxy. Those coherent streams of stars are signatures of the galaxy's formation from smaller building blocks," she said. "I'll use the Lick observations to measure the velocities of streams found by SEGUE and other surveys."</p><p>The SDSS instruments can determine a star's velocity along the line of sight of the telescope. To obtain a complete picture of the star's motion in three dimensions, however, astronomers must also measure its motion in the plane of the sky. This requires the sharpest possible images of the star to determine its exact position in the sky and how that changes over time. For distant stars, the change in position, even over a year or two, is so small that it can be obscured by blurring of the star's image in the telescope. </p><p>That's where the adaptive optics technology pioneered at Lick Observatory comes in. Adaptive optics (AO) can correct for the blurring of telescope images caused by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Using the AO system on Lick's Shane Telescope, images of stars are so sharp they appear ten times smaller than uncorrected images, Rockosi said.</p><p>"Adaptive optics is a fantastic tool and will be very powerful for studying the distant galaxy. This project is an ideal match between the SEGUE survey and the great facilities we have here at Lick Observatory," she said.</p><p>Rockosi will use the SEGUE survey to carefully select the most useful targets for follow-up observations at Lick. She said it will take two or three years to obtain the data she needs to determine the three-dimensional velocities of a large number of stars. She can then use those findings to address fundamental questions about our galaxy and the mysterious dark matter that holds it together. </p><p>Most of the mass in the universe is dark matter that we cannot directly observe. Every galaxy is surrounded by a halo of dark matter that can only be detected by observing its gravitational effects. Rockosi's precise measurements of stellar velocities will provide a unique set of data that can be used to measure the total mass of our galaxy and the shape of its dark matter halo. </p><p>The Packard Fellowship program, established in 1988, provides support  for science and engineering researchers early in their careers, allowing them to pursue their research with few funding restrictions and limited paperwork requirements.

But you don't need an advanced degree or even a telescope to participate--just a computer, access to the Internet, and an interest in astronomy.</p>
<p>The project, called Systemic, enlists volunteers to help astronomers better understand what kinds of planetary systems inhabit our galaxy, the Milky Way, and whether systems like our solar system are common. Astronomers have already found nearly 200 extrasolar planets orbiting other stars. But according to Gregory Laughlin, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, the types of planetary systems astronomers are finding may not represent the full range of what is out there.</p>
<p>"There are interesting and profound selection effects in the data," said Laughlin, who started the Systemic project with a small group of collaborators.</p>
<p>The technique most often used to find extrasolar planets relies on measuring slight wobbles in a star's motion caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. This technique favors configurations in which the orbiting planet is not only large, like Jupiter, but also close to the star. As a result, so-called "hot Jupiters" are overrepresented in the current census of extrasolar planets.</p>
<p>Other potential biases arise from factors that limit how observations are made. Astronomers are often limited to blocks of telescope time lasting only a few days, which means they cannot observe prospective planetary systems as often as they would like. The limited geographic locations of telescopes also limit what parts of the sky astronomers can observe. As a result of these kinds of restrictions, some planetary systems are studied more than others, and so the current data on extrasolar planets does not yet fully reflect what is really out there, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>To get a better handle on these problems, Laughlin and his collaborators launched the Systemic project, in which public participation will help create a virtual database of extrasolar planetary systems. His team includes Aaron Wolf, who developed the Systemic software as a UCSC undergraduate; graduate student Stefano Meschiari; postdoctoral researcher Eugenio Rivera; and Paul Shankland at the U.S. Naval Observatory.</p>
<p>Laughlin said he was inspired by the success of public participation in other scientific research projects, such as SETI@home, where users download a screensaver that uses their personal computer's processing power to analyze radio telescope data. He wanted to do something similar that would further stir public interest in astronomy. Instead of just a screensaver, however, he wanted something that also engaged the user.</p>
<p>"We wanted to involve the public in a meaningful way," Laughlin said.</p>

<p>The project involves a sophisticated simulation of the search for planets. The researchers created a data set of 100,000 stars, complete with many diverse planetary systems. Participants can analyze this virtual galaxy with software available on the project web site (<a href="http://oklo.org">http://oklo.org</a>). Using the software, volunteers can analyze the data for a target star, varying planetary properties like mass, orbital shape, and period to find a configuration that best fits the data. The web site includes a tutorial on the software, called the Systemic Console, as well as a blog, which Laughlin updates regularly.</p>
<p>The simulated search uses the same kind of planetary wobble data that astronomers measure, and it also incorporates all the observational biases they encounter when collecting real data. What the public provides is a set of simulated observations the researchers can compare with observations in the real world. No one knows how extrasolar planets are distributed in the Milky Way, but the researchers know the full range of planetary systems in the simulated virtual galaxy. By comparing the simulated observations with the real observations, the researchers hope to better understand how well, or how poorly, the search process collects a census of extrasolar planets.</p>

<p>"How good are we at detecting strange systems? Stars with three planets instead of two? Two instead of one? There are a lot of questions like this that can be addressed with a large-scale simulation," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>And because it is a large-scale simulation, the participation of the public is critical. Complicated systems with multiple planets require a human eye and patience to arrive at an accurate description. It is a time-consuming process that involves a lot of data.</p>
<p>"We need public participation because the most interesting systems are very hard to decipher," said Laughlin. "Automated methods often fail to adequately describe them."</p>

<p>Recruiting the public to do astronomical research is not new to Laughlin, who helped start the Transitsearch project (<a href="http://www.transitsearch.org/">http://www.transitsearch.org/</a>). Transitsearch asked amateur astronomers to point their telescopes at potential extrasolar systems and to search for events called transits, when a planet passes in front of its star, slightly dimming the starlight. Astronomers can learn about the size, composition, and atmosphere of the planet just from the dimming of the light. Of course, Transitsearch requires participants to have telescopes and cameras. Systemic invites public participation without the need for expensive equipment.</p>
<p>Systemic is now in an introductory phase to develop a reliable user base. The first of the virtual data will not be released for another month. Meanwhile, scientists have released real data of extrasolar systems for people to analyze. <em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em> magazine is sponsoring a contest in which participants race to find the best configuration of a planetary system, with a new set of data every two weeks. Winners receive a star atlas.</p>
<p>Although the project started in January, the software and the web site were not available until two months ago. So far, several hundred people have already volunteered and are producing good results, Laughlin said. In some cases, he said, volunteers have found better descriptions of planetary systems than the astronomers.</p>
<p>While users have come from all walks of life, educators and students form a major market for Systemic. The web site already receives 800 unique hits a day, Laughlin said. Eventually, he hopes to reach 10,000 users.</p>
<p>"I think it's realistic because the Internet is a global thing. We have users from all over the world," he said.</p>
<p>As computers become more powerful in the coming decades, the researchers hope to go beyond virtual data of planetary systems. Laughlin said he envisions creating entire virtual worlds that people can explore and that remain true to the laws of physics.</p>

Other articles address issues of involuntary body modifications--such as aging and warfare--in the context of organ transplants, prosthetics, and anti-aging technology, raising questions of who deserves or who can afford a "normal" body. </p><p>A piece by City University of New York sociology professor Victoria Pitts, author of the book Surgery Junkies: The Cultural Boundaries of Cosmetic Surgery, focuses on cosmetic surgery and tattooing--examining what these practices tell us about self-identity and the values inscribed on bodies by the beauty industry. And an essay by University of Kentucky professor Virginia Blum contends that it is mainly through the "normalizing" effect of television that cosmetic surgery is no longer simply thought of as an expression of vanity.</p><p>The book also features several essays written in response to a posthumous exhibition at UC Santa Cruz of photographs, videos, and mixed media by artist Hannah Wilke. From the 1970s until 1993, Wilke produced work that examined the body and its representation--culminating with a stark, moving series of photographs of her face and body during her struggle and eventual death from cancer.</p><p>"This is a book that tries to take apart easy value judgments that name behaviors as normal or pathological, beautiful or ugly, and voluntary or compulsory," Moglen noted. </p><p>"There's nothing quite like it that is available now," she added. "The contributors are looking at a range of practices that aren't usually linked: tattooing, cosmetic surgery, life extension technologies, self-cutting. These are hot issues right now, and they are very relevant to people's everyday lives."</p><p>Bodies in the Making is the second publication of the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Advanced Feminist Research in a series titled "Feminist Provocations," published by New Pacific Press.

<p><strong>From George Blumenthal, UC Santa Cruz Acting Chancellor:</strong></p>
<p>While the announcement today came as no surprise, it is disappointing to learn that the University of California is being sued over its recent approval of the Long-Range Development Plan for the Santa Cruz campus. The University believes the plan is fully compliant with the law and is necessary to meet California's societal needs as well as to provide future access to UC for students throughout California.</p>
<p>Since my appointment as Acting Chancellor in July, I have personally expressed in public meetings and private conversations with City and other elected officials my willingness to work together and avoid costly litigation. In fact, this lawsuit will prove extremely costly for the city, county, and the campus at a time when we should be combining our resources to solve problems together.</p>
<p>In response to community concerns, I recommended to UC Regents last month that the board take the unilateral step of reducing by 25 percent the potential enrollment growth in UCSC's long-range plan. The Regents accepted that recommendation in their unanimous vote.</p>
<p>I remain convinced that the most productive course for the City, County, and University is one of full engagement concerning the issues arising from University growth. As Acting Chancellor of UCSC, I pledge to actively pursue that kind of serious engagement about our shared future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915067e58072704601a012ff9a720757"><name>963</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Stanley Flatté to give UCSC Emeriti Faculty Lecture on Thursday, November 2</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Flatte</keywords><start-date>1161759600000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Stanley Flatté to...</display-name><path>/2006/10/963</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/963</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338219962</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338219962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Stanley Flatté, professor emeritus and research professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, will give the Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC on Thursday, November 2.

Will the world's oil supply dry up in 40 years or 400 years? (Both figures have been suggested.) What can solar, wind, biofuels, hydrogen, fuel cells, and nuclear energy contribute? What can be the role of conservation practices, such as the use of more efficient engines? Flatté will address these questions from a scientific and technological perspective.</p><p>Flatté has made important contributions in a variety of fields, including ocean acoustics, atmospheric optics, seismology, and particle physics. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society of America, the Optical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. </p><p>Flatté earned his B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley.

<p>This touring ensemble brings together celebrated artists from Muslim, Jewish, Christian, and Hindu backgrounds to perform together in a spirit of mutual respect for a one-time-only U.S. collaboration during the month of October.</p>
<p>The lineup of master musicians represents some of the world's most sophisticated artistic traditions and includes:</p>
<p>. Lebanese-American percussionist Jamey Haddad--one of the most notable world music and jazz percussionists in the United States. Haddad has collaborated with such renowned musicians as Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel, Carly Simon, Joe Lovano, the Paul Winter Consort, and Betty Buckley.</p>
<p>. The Daqqa Roudania of Taroudant--a Moroccan Sufi group whose rituals bring together a swirl of music, chant, dance, and percussion utilizing such instruments as bendir (frame) and tarija (clay) tambourines, the unique Moroccan metal castanets called qarqaba, and the wind instrument called a neffar.</p>
<p>. Palestinian-American multi-instrumentalist Zafer Tawil--based in New York City and playing the violin, oud (lute), percussion, and qanoun (hammered dulcimer), he has performed with some of the Arab world's most celebrated artists, including violinist and oud master Simon Shaheen and rai singer Cheb Mami--as well as with Western superstars like Sting.</p>
<p>. Vocalist Susan Hellauer--one of the founding members of the extraordinarily popular early music ensemble Anonymous 4, whose recordings have sold well over one million copies worldwide and whom Billboard magazine recently praised, saying: "For sheer radiance.nobody else comes close."</p>

<p>. Gerard Edery--born in Casablanca to a Jewish family and one of today's leading interpreters of Sephardic vocal music, he has also performed more than 30 roles with opera companies around the United States.</p>
<p>. South Indian singer Aruna Sairam--one of the most celebrated practitioners of the intricate Carnatic (South Indian classical) style, which is rooted in the devotional traditions of South India's Hindu temples.</p>
<p>The tour is an outgrowth of Morocco's world-acclaimed annual FÃ¨s Festival of World Sacred Music held each summer in Morocco's former imperial city of FÃ¨s--which brings together artists, audiences, political figures, and spiritual leaders from across the globe. It was founded 12 years ago in the wake of the first Gulf War with the goal of creating a cultural dialogue between the world's diverse cultures.</p>
<p>After the events of September 11, a U.S. tour was initiated in 2004 when festival organizers noted a large drop in the number of Americans attending the Moroccan festival. The idea was to bring to this country the spirit of FÃ¨s--which for centuries has been one of the great centers of spiritual, political, and intellectual life within the Muslim world, and has been home to generations of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian communities living side-by-side.</p>
<p>This will be the second touring ensemble from the festival to perform in the United States. Over the years, the Moroccan event has attracted some of the world's most celebrated performers and cultural ambassadors, including Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar, Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour, Brazilian singer and guitarist (and Brazil's current Minister of Culture) Gilberto Gil, and South African vocalist Miriam Makeba, plus many soloists and ensembles from FÃ¨s itself and surrounding areas of Morocco.</p>

The daughter of historian and U.S. Communist Party leader Herbert Aptheker, she grew up in a lively home environment that often included spirited visits by such renowned family friends as W. E. B. DuBois and Paul Robeson. </p><p>In her new book, "Intimate Politics: How I Grew up Red, Fought for Free Speech, and Became a Feminist Rebel," Aptheker tells a fascinating story of her life-a life that traces her role in major historical and political events ranging from her co-leadership of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, the movement against the war in Vietnam, and the trial of Angela Davis, to the building of the Women's Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Aptheker also tells a parallel story of shocking childhood sexual abuse, depression, and violence amidst the backdrop of events that made up a key chapter in our nation's history. As Barbara Ehrenreich, author of "Nickel and Dimed," puts it in a quote on the book's cover: "You can read 'Intimate Politics' as part of the history of American radicalism.Or you can read it as the painfully honest, often shocking, story of one woman's coming of age from confusion and depression to self-confidence and peace. Either way, you'll be riveted."</p><p>"The book moves back and forth between personal and political events to show how they interact," said Aptheker. "I wanted it to be helpful for people-to other survivors of sexual abuse such as incest, rape, and violence-so they could see that healing is possible."</p><p>Described by The Chronicle of Higher Education as "a stunning new memoir" the book does not shy away from documenting Aptheker's childhood sexual abuse by her father, her illegal, pre-Roe abortion in Mexico, her battle with severe depression, and a sexually abusive relationship. But as she took on prominent roles in the politically turbulent events of the 1960s and '70s, Aptheker describes how she eventually comes to terms with her lesbian identity and political convictions--becoming in the process a prominent feminist leader and activist.  </p><p>A scholar of history with a national reputation for her talents as an instructor, Aptheker has been teaching one of the country's largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses for the past 24 years at UC Santa Cruz. Starting out in 1980 as the sole lecturer in the Women's Studies Department, she became the department's first ladder-rank faculty member in 1987. Aptheker was honored with the Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001. </p><p>She is also the author of "The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis" (Cornell University Press, 1997) and "Tapestries of Life: Women's Work, Women's Consciousness, and the Meaning of Daily Experience" (University of Massachusetts Press, 1982).</p><p>					                                           #####</p><p>Bettina Aptheker will celebrate the publication of "Intimate Politics" with a book reading/signing event at Bookshop Santa Cruz on November 2 at 7:30 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91506cb98072704601a012fffd9c3ea3"><name>967</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Free public forum on Persian Gulf crisis Nov. 2 at Veterans Memorial Hall in Santa Cruz</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>persian gulf, war, iraq, crisis, forum, panel</keywords><start-date>1161759600000</start-date><display-name>Free public forum on...</display-name><path>/2006/10/967</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/967</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338221195</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338221195</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The public is invited to a free panel discussion about the Persian Gulf Crisis with an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, an expert on international terrorism, and a <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> reporter who has covered wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kashmir.</p>

The town hall forum, "The Persian Gulf: Situations &amp; Strategies," will take place Thursday, Nov. 2, from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Veterans Memorial Hall Ballroom in downtown Santa Cruz. The panel is being sponsored by the Center for Global, International and Regional Studies (CGIRS) at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"With the Bush administration zig-zagging and Democrats saying we can't stay and we can't pull out, it's hard to know what's actually going on in the Persian Gulf today," said CGIRS director Ronnie Lipschutz, a professor of politics at UCSC. "This panel discussion will bring together three highly accomplished people with varied expertise to help us understand what's taking place in the Middle East."</p>
<p>Each panelist will make a 20-minute presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session, said Lipschutz.</p>
<p>Panelist Alan Richards, a professor of environmental studies at UCSC, is an expert on the politics of the Middle East and a critic of Bush administration policy, which he says is inflaming widespread despair and anger among young Arabs and Muslims. A frequent consultant to the U.S. government on Middle Eastern affairs, Richards has briefed top Pentagon officials about the sources of instability in the Middle East and cautions that current policies are contributing to rampant anti-Americanism in the region.</p>
<p>Panelist Anna Badkhen has been a staff reporter for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> since 2001. She has reported extensively on the Iraq war, as well as wars in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kashmir, and the Middle East. Currently based on the East Coast, Badkhen is an astute observer of domestic and international politics. Before joining the Chronicle, the Russian-born Badkhen was a reporter for the <em>St. Petersburg Times</em> and the <em>Moscow Times</em>.</p>
<p>Panelist John Arquilla is an associate professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, where he teaches courses in the history of special operations, international political theory, the revolution in military affairs, and information-age conflict. An expert on terror and transnational criminal networks, Arquilla is a strong supporter of the global war on terrorism but a critic of the war in Iraq. He is coauthor with David Ronfeldt of the 2001 book, <em>Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy</em>, which analyzes the rise of global terrorism and criminal networks and considers strategic options for waging the current war on terrorism.</p>
<p>"These panelists are the experts who can tell us what's really going on in the week before the midterm elections," said Lipschutz.</p>

UC Observatories is a multicampus research unit with headquarters at the UCSC campus. Bolte has served as interim director since Joseph S. Miller retired from the position last year to return to full-time teaching and research. <br/>
<br/>
<p>"Professor Bolte is an ideal choice for this important position," said Acting Chancellor Blumenthal. "With his proven administrative expertise, as well as his notable accomplishments both in observational astronomy and in the development of astronomical instrumentation, Mike will provide critical leadership for astronomers at UC Santa Cruz and throughout the UC system."</p>
<p>"The director of UCO/Lick serves in a critical academic and administrative position for the entire University of California," added Provost Hume. "Astronomers associated with UCO/Lick conduct research that has international impact and greatly expands our knowledge of the cosmos. Professor Bolte is taking the helm at an exciting time, as we cross the threshold toward a very promising era of new discovery."</p>
<p>UCO/Lick operates the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton and the UCO Technical Labs at UCSC, and is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Lick Observatory, established in 1888, was the first major mountaintop observatory. It continues to be an important research site and is a leader in the development of instrumentation for adaptive optics. Most of the instruments for the Lick and Keck Observatories are designed and fabricated at UCO's technical facilities at UCSC and UCLA. The UCSC facilities include an optical lab and shops, an engineering lab, an advanced detector lab, and the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics.</p>
<p>The Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea houses the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, the twin 10-meter Keck I and Keck II Telescopes. The observatory is operated by a scientific partnership among UC, the California Institute of Technology, and NASA. The UCO/Lick director serves on the Board of Directors of the California Association for Research in Astronomy, the governing board of Keck.</p>
<p>"I am excited by this opportunity and honored to be selected," Bolte said. "The preeminence of the University of California's astronomy community is due in large part to the outstanding facilities that we have built at Lick Observatory and Keck Observatory. I am looking forward to taking on the challenges of keeping Lick Observatory vital, maintaining the Keck Observatory at the research vanguard, and using the vast talent pool in UCO and UC astronomy to help design, fund, and build the Thirty-Meter Telescope. I am also humbled by the magnitude of these challenges and inspired by the lofty standards set by previous directors who have led UC astronomy to its current distinction in world astronomy."</p>
<p>The Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) will be the first of a new generation of giant ground-based telescopes. The project is a collaborative effort involving UC, Caltech, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy (ACURA). Bolte has been active in the planning and design of the TMT and is currently on the TMT Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Bolte's research interests include the evolution of stars and the nature of the earliest stars to form in the universe. Much of his research involves observations of the oldest stars and star clusters in our Milky Way galaxy to better understand the first epoch of star formation. Bolte was coprincipal investigator on the Echellete Spectrograph and Imager on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope, and he led the development of a new prime-focus camera for the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Bolte earned his B.S. in physics from the University of Central Florida, his M.S. in physics from Florida State University, and his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Washington. He was a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSC before joining the UCSC faculty in 1993.</p>
<p>UCSC is one of the world's leading centers for both observational and theoretical research in astronomy and astrophysics. The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics includes 25 faculty members, whose research interests range from the solar system and the Milky Way to the most distant galaxies in the universe and the most fundamental questions of cosmology.</p>

Miller, who served as director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory for 14 years before stepping down last year, also received the UC Citation of Excellence. Both awards were presented at a dinner in Miller's honor on October 20. </p><p>George Breslauer, executive vice chancellor and provost at UC Berkeley, presented Miller with the Berkeley Medal. It is bestowed on "individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievements whose work or contributions to society illustrate the ideals of the University and contribute to its goals, and whose careers have manifestly benefited the public well beyond the demands of tradition, rank, or direct service to the University." Previous recipients of this award include Herman Wouk, Francois Mitterrand, Glenn Seaborg, Gordon Moore, and Bill Clinton. </p><p>UC Vice Provost for Research Larry Coleman presented Miller with the UC Citation of Excellence.</p><p>Miller served as director of UCO/Lick from 1991 to 2005. His research interests include quasars and active galactic nuclei, focusing on their relationships with the surrounding environment and the nature of their host galaxies. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994 and served as chair of the AURA Coordinating Council of Observatory Research Directors from 1997 to 1999. </p><p>Miller earned his B.A. in astronomy and physics from UCLA and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Wisconsin. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1967.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915070f88072704601a012ff264a2f74"><name>970</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rare bilingual Latino literature conference at UCSC on Nov. 10-11</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1162278000000</start-date><display-name>Rare bilingual Latino literature...</display-name><path>/2006/10/970</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/970</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338222280</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338222280</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A distinguished group of writers, editors, and critics will converge on the UCSC campus November 10 and 11 for a bilingual conference on Latino literature, titled "Latino Literature/La Literatura Latina: Writing, Publishing, Reading." </p><p>In addition to a series of academic panels, the conference will feature eight nationally recognized writers who will read from their works in two evening sessions titled "Latina/o Writers Read." Admission is free and the public is encouraged to attend.</p><p>"It is rare to find a conference about Latino literature of this magnitude," noted associate professor of literature Juan Poblete, who organized the event along with his colleagues in the UCSC Literature Department, professor Norma Klahn and associate professor Kirsten  Silva Gruesz. "This is not something that happens on a regular basis for the Latino community or for those who are interested in Latino literature."</p><p>"In fact you don't find many conferences on Latino literature at all in the U.S.," Poblete added. "It's usually just a small part of conferences on minority literature featuring one or two Latino writers."</p><p>Poblete said that the conference was organized to explore the variety and diversity of Latino literature, noting that it is an umbrella term covering writing that spans a broad range of possibilities--from Spanish to English with all the hybrids in between, such as Spanglish. "We don't want to homogenize Latino literature or obscure that there are multiple projects and a wide spectrum of writers that fall under that heading," he explained. </p><p>Poblete added that the conference will also include the participation of editors and booksellers.</p><p>"We have a full panel on Saturday morning about the process of publishing and circulation," said Poblete. "We will discuss questions such as: What makes a book Latino? What gets published and distributed? What are the constraints that publishing companies and nonprofits are faced with when trying to publish Latino literature?"</p><p>Another panel will talk about the audiences for Latino literature, discussing the possibilities of opening up the perception of the genre from just fiction, to other forms of writing such as nonfiction, screenwriting, radio, and television writing. Panelists will also examine the history of Latino literature in the U.S. "There is a long tradition of Latino writing that goes against the popular perception that it is the 'new kid on the block,'" noted Poblete. </p><p>Guest writers and panelists at the conference will include:</p><p>. Francisco Goldman--author of three award-winning novels, The Long Night of White Chickens, The Ordinary Seaman, and recently The Divine Husband. His short fiction and journalism have been published in Harper's, Esquire, the New York Times Sunday Magazine,  and the New Yorker. The Ordinary Seaman was a finalist for the IMPAC Dublin International Literary Prize and was named one of the Hungry Mind One Hundred Books of the Century. </p><p>. Alfredo Vea--a former migrant farmworker who is now a practicing criminal defense attorney, is also the author of three novels, La Maravilla, The Silver Cloud Cafe and Gods Go Begging, which was named One of the Best Books of 1999 by the Los Angeles Times. Vea has been described as "a cross between John Steinbeck and Gabriel Garcia Marquez." </p><p>. Nina Marie Martinez--the author of Caramba! A Tale told in Turns of the Card, holds a bachelor's degree in literature from UC Santa Cruz. The San Francisco Chronicle said of her book:  "A triumph of whimsy and imagination-Monty Python meets One Hundred Years of Solitude . . . Wow! This is something absolutely and authentically new! This author is going to be a star." Martinez is currently at work on her second novel.</p><p>. Tino Villanueva--the founder of Imagine Publishers, Inc., and editor of Imagine: International Chicano Poetry Journal. Author of the book-length poem Scene from the Movie GIANT, Villanueva has published three other volumes of poetry, Hay Otra Voz Poems, Shaking Off the Dark, and Chronicle of My Worst Years/ Crónica de mis años peores. Villanueva won the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation for Scene from the Movie GIANT in 1994. </p><p>. Reyna Grande--author of Across a Hundred Mountains, her first novel, of which People magazine said: "Grande's spare, elegantly written tale of a young Mexican girl searching for her farmworker father, missing since he left to seek his fortune in 'el otro lado', is a timely and riveting read." A graduate of UC Santa Cruz, Grande was named a PEN Center USA Emerging Voices Rosenthal Fellow in 2003. </p><p>. Alicia Alarcón--the author of La Migra me hizo los mandados, moved to Los Angeles from Jalisco, Mexico, where she began her journalism career with La Opinión, serving as both a reporter and an editor. She later became the West Coast reporter for Univisión and was contracted by CNN as a Latin American radio correspondent. Alarcón eventually became the first woman to host a radio news and opinion program during prime time; her program currently airs on Radio Unica (1580) in Los Angeles. She is also working on projects for television.</p><p>. Susana Chavez-Silverman--specializing in gender and sexuality studies, Latin American and U.S. Latina/Chicana literature, and poetry, has published numerous essays on these topics and coedited several books. Her most recent book, Killer  Crónicas: Bilingual Memories, was published in 2004 after she was awarded a fellowship by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities for a project on contemporary Argentine women's poetry. </p><p>. Alicia Gaspar de Alba--won the Premio Aztlan Award given by Rudolfo and Patricia Anaya for her book of fiction The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories. Her first novel, Sor Juana's Second Dream, won First Place in Historical Fiction in the Latino Literary Hall of Fame in 2001, and has been translated into Spanish and German. Her latest novel, Desert Blood: The Juarez Murders, was released in 2005 by Arte Publico Press. Gaspar de Alba describes Desert Blood as "a mystery novel based on the 12-year crime wave of murdered, raped, and mutilated young Mexican women on the El Paso/Juarez border."</p><p>For more information and a detailed schedule of events, plus directions for the conference, go to:</p><p>http://www2.ucsc.edu/raza/litconference.shtml </p><p>or contact Juan Poblete at jpoblete@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-5734.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27927068072704601a012ff1b8af411"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626102962</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626102962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-page id="c4b93f0a8072704601015f88cf0075af"><name>regents-visit-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Visit to UCSC by UC Regents</title><start-date>1161331200000</start-date><display-name>Visit to UCSC by UC Regents</display-name><path>/2006/10/regents-visit-ucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/10/regents-visit-ucsc</link><created-by>jward1</created-by><created-on>1296085630648</created-on><last-modified-by>jward1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1296085728874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Yesterday marked the end of a successful visit by UC Regents and other guests to the UC Santa Cruz campus. This was a major event that will provide long-term benefit to UCSC. We were proud to present representative campus distinctions, showcasing students and faculty whose scholarly and interdisciplinary work is both innovative and beneficial to society. 
<p>Despite the overall positive aspects of the visit, we were deeply troubled by the lack of civility and outbursts of violence that occurred during the demonstration on Wednesday at the Humanities Lecture Hall, where Regents and others were assembled.</p>
<p>We are neither surprised nor concerned about peaceful demonstrations whenever Regents visit any UC campus. In fact, such demonstrations are time-honored ways for students and others to express their views.</p>
<p>What was both unexpected and completely unacceptable was pushing, kicking, biting, spitting, heaping verbal abuse, and throwing bottles and decayed fruit at staff and visitors, as occurred on Wednesday. Staff members, including our police officers, were verbally abused and physically injured. Guests from the community were pushed and spat upon. Regents, campus visitors, and others were trapped in the hall for nearly two hours before they could leave the building without the use of force.</p>
<p>Such actions crossed a line of behavior that put people's safety at risk. While many of the participants tried to remain peaceful, a significant part of the crowd became unruly and engaged in behavior that included violent and dangerous acts. These behaviors are unacceptable in any civil community.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this unacceptable behavior by a few individuals resulted in cancellation of a part of the program. As a result, our visitors missed several planned presentations of the exceptional work of our students and faculty. This outcome essentially silenced the voices of those faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Regents ended their visit with a very favorable view of UCSC, based on the excellent interactions with faculty, staff, and students during the rest of their visit, including thoughtful comments by graduate and undergraduate students at Thursday's public comment period. Even so, an opportunity was lost to impress them even more.</p>
<p>We believe that UC police behaved appropriately and professionally in the face of threats to the safety of campus visitors. In the end, three individuals were arrested by police, and one of them could face three felony charges of battery against a police officer. In addition to the consequences that may result from legal action by the District Attorney's Office for those three individuals, any students among the demonstrators found to have violated campus policy are subject to sanctions through the campus Student Judicial process.</p>
<p>Many actions during the demonstration violated the Principles of Community that this campus values. We urge each of you to review and renew your commitment to the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">UCSC Principles of Community</a>.</p>
<p>Students, faculty, staff (including UCSC police), and visitors are all members of our community and are entitled to civil and respectful treatment.</p>
<p>Please join us in working together to ensure a respectful environment in which all opinions, including dissent, can be expressed freely, effectively, and with civility and respect.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Acting Chancellor George R.
