The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, offers the first evidence in vertebrates of an important theoretical concept in evolutionary biology known as "greenbeard" altruism.</p>
<p>"This reflects a major breakthrough in our understanding of how cooperative behavior arises from genes," said Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and first author of a paper describing the new findings, published May 9, 2006, in the&#160;<i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i><i>.</i></p>
<p>The paper describes unrelated male lizards that form cooperative partnerships to protect their territories. These partnerships are often mutually beneficial, enabling both partners to father more offspring than they would on their own. Under some circumstances, however, one male in the pair may have few or no offspring as a result of protecting its partner from the aggressive intrusions of other lizards.</p>
<p>This type of cooperation, in which one individual bears all the costs and another unrelated individual receives the benefits, is called "true altruism." These lizards have an annual life cycle, so this behavior may spell the end of the altruistic male's lineage.</p>
<p>The evolution of cooperation is puzzling because cooperative systems are vulnerable to cheaters or defectors. Cheaters and defectors benefit from the cooperative behavior of others without paying the costs, so they ought to be favored under natural selection. But then cheater genes would spread in the population, and the cooperative system would collapse. The greenbeard effect is one way to get around this.</p>
<p>The concept originated with the British evolutionary theorist W. D. Hamilton and was popularized by Richard Dawkins in his book <i>The Selfish Gene.</i> Dawkins illustrated the concept with a hypothetical example in which a green beard serves as a marker enabling individuals with a gene for cooperation to recognize others with the same gene. The greenbeard gene (or genes) must do three things: establish a signal (the green beard), enable recognition of others that share the signal, and promote cooperative behavior towards other greenbeards.</p>
<p>In side-blotched lizards, the greenbeards have blue throats. This species comes in three different throat colors--orange, yellow, and blue--and throat color corresponds to different territorial behaviors in the males. Blue-throated males form partnerships in which two males cooperate to protect their territories; orange-throated males are highly aggressive and usurp territory from other lizards; and yellow-throated males sneak into the territory of other males to mate with females.</p>
<p>Previous research by Sinervo and his collaborators has demonstrated that these strategies result in a kind of "rock-paper-scissors" game in which orange defeats blue, blue defeats yellow, and yellow defeats orange. The lizard populations go through cycles in which one color after another increases its numbers at the expense of the others, but none are able to maintain dominance.</p>
<p>In the new paper, Sinervo's group investigated the genetic basis of the cooperative behavior in blue-throated males. They found that, in addition to the gene that controls throat color, there are at least three other genetic factors that determine the components of the greenbeard effect.</p>
<p>"Our study provides the first comprehensive genetic evidence of a greenbeard in vertebrates," Sinervo said. "Unlike Hamilton's idea and most modern views of greenbeards, we find that many genetic loci across the genome 'cooperate' to establish conditions for the greenbeard behaviors."</p>
<p>The cooperative behavior of blue-throated males plays out differently depending on the frequency of aggressive orange males in the population. In years when there are few orange males, cooperating blue males both benefit. But when orange males are common, one blue male ends up serving as a buffer for his territorial partner, bearing the brunt of the advances of aggressive orange males. Thus, the behavior of the blue-throated males cycles between mutualism and altruism, depending on where the population as a whole is in the rock-paper-scissors cycle.</p>
<p>"One of the big problems in the evolution of altruism is explaining how it gets off the ground in the first place," said Alexis Chaine, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper. "This is a situation that oscillates between mutualism and altruism, depending on the circumstances. Periods of mutualism give a much-needed boost at early stages in the evolution of altruistic genes and also provide long-term stability to the cooperative relationship."</p>
<p>"True altruism may be something that is evolutionarily fleeting, and what keeps it stable is the long-term payoff," Sinervo added. "The lizards are in a bind. They can't break up the partnership, because the success of the blue strategy depends on cooperation. Evolution has set them up so they can't cheat and turn on their partner."</p>
<p>The study is the culmination of two decades of laboratory and field research by Sinervo's lab to develop a deep pedigree of side-blotched lizards and their behavioral traits in the field. The researchers have tracked 18 generations of lizards so far and have mapped the locations of genes that coordinate reproductive behavior and throat color, as well as "genetic self-recognition"--the ability to recognize other individuals with the same gene complex.</p>
<p>The researchers used genetic tests to determine the paternity of all the lizards in each generation, and from this they could determine the "fitness" of each male in terms of the number of offspring he fathers. The fitness of altruistic blue males drops to nearly zero, while the protected partner is able to maintain high fitness. But in years when orange males are few, both blue males in a partnership have high fitness. Sinervo emphasized that the cooperative blue males are not even remotely related to one another.</p>
<p>"All other examples of greenbeards are found in invertebrates, such as ants, or lower taxa, such as slime molds, and in all these examples the researchers have not completely ruled out the confounding effects of kin selection," he said. "We establish that the greenbeard of the side-blotched lizard is not confounded by the effects of kin-helping behavior."</p>
<p>Interestingly, not all blue-throated males possess the complete set of genes required for greenbeard altruism. These "loner males" do not form partnerships with other blue-throated males. Their fitness is higher than that of altruistic males, but lower than that of the protected partner. And in years when blue-male partnerships are mutually beneficial, the fitness of loner males is lower than that of cooperating males.</p>
<p>The existence of loner blue males means that the genetic self-recognition required to establish a partnership involves more than the recognition of a blue throat in the other male. Cooperative males are able to recognize others that possess the complete set of genes for cooperative behavior.</p>
<p>"These are genes that cause lizards to recognize one another at the gene level and cause them to act in a certain way. The genes are driving the whole social system," Sinervo said.</p>

Singer will speak about his new book: The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter (Rodale Books; May, 2006). Admission is free and open to the public.</p><p>The author of Animal Liberation and coauthor of Animal Factories, Singer was named by Time magazine last year as one of 2005's "100 Most Influential People." He is often described as the world's leading ethicist, and The New Yorker once wrote that Singer "may be the most controversial philosopher alive."  His theories have set off passionate debates that have been reflected today in arguments about abortion, stem-cell research, and euthanasia. </p><p>A professor of bioethics at Princeton University, Singer was the founding president of the International Association of Bioethics, and founding coeditor of the journal Bioethics. His works have appeared in 20 languages, and Singer is the author of the major article on ethics in the current edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. </p><p>The Economist noted that "Singer's influence extends to the world beyond the ivory tower partly because he writes with such lucidity and quiet passion about genuinely pressing questions." And the New York Times Book Review noted that "No other living philosopher has had this kind of influence."</p><p>The event is cosponsored by KUSP, the Environmental Studies Department, and the Forum on the Environment--a new venture at UCSC initiated by Victoria Kamsler, a visiting professor this spring in the Philosophy Department from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p><p>"The Forum will be videoconferencing in distinguished experts from around the world on environmental subjects," Kamsler noted. "It will meet weekly, and a local faculty member will act as interlocutor with our videoconferenced guests, who will take questions from our audience. The Forum will be podcast, and it has been designated as a pilot project for Media Services Webcasting," she added.  </p><p>Parking is available at the East Remote Parking Lot for $5 with a free shuttle to the event.

But researchers already knew that a gamma-ray burst near enough to threaten our planet was highly unlikely. They are more interested in the implications of the new study for understanding how gamma-ray bursts and supernovae are triggered by the collapse of massive stars.</p><p>"The fundamentally interesting observation is that the stars that explode as gamma-ray bursts have a different distribution from stars that explode as supernovae. Gamma-ray bursts tend to take place in galaxies not like ours," said Stephen Thorsett, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the <i>Nature</i> paper.</p><p>Thorsett first described the terrestrial implications of a nearby gamma-ray burst in a 1995 paper, but he said the likelihood of such an event now appears to be very small. </p><p>The new paper is a comprehensive analysis of observations of gamma-ray bursts and supernovae made by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope over the past ten years. The Hubble observations show that long-duration GRBs--those lasting more than one to two seconds--tend to occur in small irregular galaxies where stars are deficient in the heavier elements. Spiral galaxies like the Milky Way tend to be rich in heavier elements.</p><p>The study involved a large team of researchers led by Andrew Fruchter of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a leading expert on gamma-ray bursts and supernovae, is also a coauthor of the paper.</p><p>The paper looks at long-duration gamma-ray bursts and type II or core-collapse supernovae, both of which result from the violent deaths of massive stars. When such a star exhausts its fuel, the core collapses and explodes. The new findings shed light on the conditions that determine whether the collapse will generate a brilliant supernova or an even more powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB). </p><p>Fruchter's team used Hubble to examine the environments of 42 long-duration GRBs and 16 core-collapse supernovae. The researchers found that most of the long GRBs in the sample were detected in small, faint, misshapen galaxies. Such "irregular" galaxies are usually deficient in heavier elements. Only one of the GRBs was spotted in a spiral galaxy. By contrast, the hosts of supernovae were divided equally between spiral and irregular galaxies.</p><p>The researchers also found that long GRBs are far more concentrated on the brightest regions of their host galaxies where the most massive stars reside. Supernovae, on the other hand, occur throughout their host galaxies.</p><p>"The discovery that long-duration GRBs lie on the brightest regions of their host galaxies suggests that they come from the most massive stars--20 or more times as massive as our Sun," Fruchter said. "Their occurrence in small irregulars implies that only stars that lack heavy chemical elements [elements heavier than hydrogen and helium] tend to produce long-duration GRBs." </p><p>Galaxies build up a stockpile of heavier chemical elements through the ongoing evolution of successive generations of stars. Massive stars abundant in heavy elements are unlikely to trigger GRBs because they may lose too much material through stellar "winds" off their surfaces before they collapse and explode. When this happens, the stars don't have enough mass left to produce the proper conditions that would trigger GRBs. </p><p>These findings fit with the predictions of Woosley's "collapsar model," which describes how a long GRB is produced when a massive star collapses to form a black hole. The more massive a star is when it dies, the more likely it is to form a black hole. And stars with low metallicity lose less mass as they burn and are more massive and rotate more rapidly when they die, Woosley said. </p><p>"The core of the star has to be rotating rapidly to make a gamma-ray burst, and as stars lose mass by blowing away material in stellar winds, they rotate more slowly," Woosley said. </p><p>When the core of a massive star collapses to form a black hole, the energy from the collapse escapes along a narrow jet, which burns its way through the remnants of the  star. The formation of directed jets that concentrate energy along a narrow beam explains why GRBs are so powerful. </p><p>GRBs can be divided into two classes: short bursts, which last between milliseconds and about two seconds and produce very high-energy radiation, and long bursts, which last between two and tens of seconds and create less energetic gamma rays. Short bursts are believed to arise from collisions between two compact objects, such as neutron stars. </p><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is an international cooperative project between NASA and the European Space Agency.

Triton is unique among all the large moons in the solar system because it orbits Neptune in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a "retrograde" orbit). It is unlikely to have formed in this configuration and was probably captured from elsewhere.</p><p>In the May 11 issue of the journal <i>Nature,</i> planetary scientists Craig Agnor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Douglas Hamilton of the University of Maryland describe a new model for the capture of planetary satellites involving a three-body gravitational encounter between a binary and a planet. According to this scenario, Triton was originally a member of a binary pair of objects orbiting the Sun. Gravitational interactions during a close approach to Neptune then pulled Triton away from its binary companion to become a satellite of Neptune.</p><p>"We've found a likely solution to the long-standing problem of how Triton arrived in its peculiar orbit. In addition, this mechanism introduces a new pathway for the capture of satellites by planets that may be relevant to other objects in the solar system," said Agnor, a researcher in UCSC's Center for the Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets.</p><p>With properties similar to the planet Pluto and about 40 percent more massive, Triton has an inclined, circular orbit that lies between a group of small inner moons with prograde orbits and an outer group of small satellites with both prograde and retrograde orbits. There are other retrograde moons in the solar system, including the small outer moons of Jupiter and Saturn, but all are tiny compared to Triton (less than a few thousandths of its mass) and have much larger and more eccentric orbits about their parent planets.</p><p>Triton may have come from a binary very similar to Pluto and its moon Charon, Agnor said. Charon is relatively massive, about one-eighth the mass of Pluto, he explained. </p><p>"It's not so much that Charon orbits Pluto, but rather both move around their mutual center of mass, which lies between the two objects," Agnor said.</p><p>In a close encounter with a giant planet like Neptune, such a system can be pulled apart by the planet's gravitational forces. The orbital motion of the binary usually causes one member to move more slowly than the other. Disruption of the binary leaves each object with residual motions that can result in a permanent change of orbital companions. This mechanism, known as an exchange reaction, could have delivered Triton to any of a variety of different orbits around Neptune, Agnor said.</p><p>An earlier scenario proposed for Triton is that it may have collided with another satellite near Neptune. But this mechanism requires the object involved in the collision to be large enough to slow Triton down, but small enough not to destroy it. The probability of such a collision is extremely small, Agnor said. </p><p>Another suggestion was that aerodynamic drag from a disk of gas around Neptune slowed Triton down enough for it to be captured. But this scenario puts constraints on the timing of the capture event, which would have to occur early in Neptune's history when the planet was surrounded by a gas disk, but late enough that the gas would disperse before it slowed Triton's orbit enough to send the moon crashing into the planet.</p><p>In the past decade, many binaries have been discovered in the Kuiper belt and elsewhere in the solar system. Recent surveys indicate that about 11 percent of Kuiper belt objects are binaries, as are about 16 percent of near-Earth asteroids.</p><p>"These discoveries pointed the way to our new explanation of Triton's capture," Hamilton said. "Binaries appear to be a ubiquitous feature of small-body populations."</p><p>The Pluto/Charon pair and binaries in the Kuiper belt are especially relevant for Triton, as their orbits abut Neptune's, he said. </p><p>"Similar objects have probably been around for billions of years, and their prevalence indicates that the binary-planet encounter that we propose for Triton's capture is not particularly restrictive," Hamilton said.</p><p>The exchange reaction described by Agnor and Hamilton may have broad applications in understanding the evolution of the solar system, which contains many irregular satellites. The researchers plan to explore the implications of their findings for other satellite systems.</p><p>This research was supported by grants from NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics, Outer Planet Research, and Origins of Solar Systems programs. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Agnor at (831) 459-2426 or cagnor@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fe54f8072704601a012ff46baf018"><name>868</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SF Federal Reserve President and CEO Janet Yellen to deliver keynote address May 27</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>economics, SCCIE, yellen, euro, dollar</keywords><start-date>1147676400000</start-date><display-name>SF Federal Reserve President...</display-name><path>/2006/05/868</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/05/868</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338186523</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338186523</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Janet Yellen, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, will deliver the keynote address on Saturday, May 27, during the upcoming conference of the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Yellen's talk, "Monetary Policy in a Global Environment," will begin at 9 p.m. PDT in the University Center at UCSC.

Denton, chancellor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has won the 2006 Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award, a prestigious national recognition of exceptional work that advances opportunities for women and girls in the sciences.</p>
<p>A jury of distinguished educators and scientists selected Denton, citing her work in developing programs on university campuses and with neighboring organizations to encourage women and girls to pursue the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p>"Maria Mitchell was a true mentor and role model for generations of women students," Denton said. "I'm deeply honored to have been selected by the association that continues her goal of making the sciences more accessible to women."</p>
<p>Denton's leadership at UC Santa Cruz and her accomplishments at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Washington were noted as examples of reaching beyond the campus into local communities and organizations to mentor girls and women in science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>
<p>Juror Nancy Doe Hopkins, Amgen professor of biology at M.I.T. and the 2004 Women in Science winner, said that Denton, in her role as chancellor, "uses the power of her leadership position to raise the visibility of issues related to supporting and advancing women and girls in science-related careers, both on and off the campus."</p>
<p>Another juror, Judy Tevethia, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, cited Denton's creative strategies to build mentoring networks. "Where they are few in number on a campus, women scientists have followed Denton's cues to find and support each other,'' she said.</p>
<p>As dean of engineering at the University of Washington for nine years before taking the top job at UC Santa Cruz, Denton created programs and strategies to match school-age girls with university students working on robotics and web-design projects. She served as principal investigator for a National Science Foundation ADVANCE grant to eliminate barriers for women in the science, engineering, and math workplaces. She also supported junior faculty in writing grants, with the result of more than doubling the sponsored research funding at the College of Engineering.</p>
<p>Earlier, at the University of Wisconsin, Denton served as faculty adviser for the Society of Women Engineers, providing advice and support to university students and encouraging them, in turn, to become mentors to young women in local high schools.</p>
<p>The jury said, "Denton's ideas and projects are accessible models for other communities to follow."</p>
<p>Denton was named Chancellor at UC Santa Cruz in late 2004. She assumed the office Feb. 14, 2005. She is an internationally known expert in engineering education and mentoring programs for women and girls.</p>
<p>Established in 1997, the annual award is named for Maria Mitchell (1818-1889), the first woman astronomer in the United States. It honors a person, program, or organization whose efforts have encouraged the advancement of girls and women in the natural and physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, computer science and technology.</p>
<p>Mitchell gained international fame in 1847 at age 29 when she discovered a comet by telescope. She became the first female professor of astronomy and trained women scientists during 23 years as a professor at Vassar College.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mmo.org">The Maria Mitchell Association</a> was founded in 1902 on Nantucket Island, Mass. in honor of Mitchell, an astronomer, educator, and librarian, who hailed from the island 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast.</p>

A team of seismologists led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, detected the slab by analyzing seismic waves reflected from the deepest layer of the mantle beneath an area off the west coast of Central America.</p><p>"If you imagine cold honey pouring onto a plate, you would see ripples and folds as it piles up and spreads out, and that's what we think we are seeing at the base of the mantle," said Alex Hutko, a graduate student in Earth sciences at UCSC and first author of a paper describing the new findings in the May 18 issue of the journal <i>Nature.</i></p><p>The discovery sheds new light on the processes that drive the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. The planet's outermost layer, or lithosphere, is broken into large, rigid plates composed of the crust and the outer layer of the mantle. New plate material is created at mid-oceanic ridges, where the ocean floor spreads apart, and old plate material is consumed in subduction zones, where one plate dives beneath another. But the fate of subducted lithosphere has been uncertain.</p><p>"There is a big debate over whether subducted slabs sink all the way down to the base of the mantle or get trapped in the upper mantle. This is one line of evidence favoring the presence of subducted slabs in the deep mantle," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC and coauthor of the <i>Nature</i> paper. </p><p>"It's the first evidence from direct imaging to support the idea that ancient seafloor makes its way down to the bottom of the mantle," Hutko added.</p><p>Within the mantle, which extends to a depth of about 1,740 miles, cold rock sinks while hot plumes rise toward the surface, and this slow circulation of mantle rock is thought to drive the movement of plates in the lithosphere. The base of the mantle absorbs heat from the core. The researchers were able to image the buckling and folding of subducted oceanic lithosphere at the base of the mantle because of the temperature difference between the relatively cool subducted slab and the hotter mantle rock surrounding it. </p><p>The subducted slab is composed of essentially the same minerals as the surrounding mantle, but its temperature is about 700 degrees Celsius cooler, Hutko said. This temperature difference affects the location of a "phase transition," where the crystal structure of the mantle rock changes due to increasing pressure and temperature with depth. Seismic energy reflected by this phase transition revealed an abrupt step in the phase boundary about 60 miles (100 kilometers) high. </p><p>"That's more than the thickness of the crust," Lay said. "It's a huge geological structure and it requires some large-scale dynamic process to produce it. A subducted slab piling up and spreading out is the only mechanism we know of that could give such an abrupt step."</p><p>The researchers also saw evidence of hot plume-like structures at the edge of the slab, indicating possible upwelling of hot material from the base of the mantle as the spreading slab pushes into it. </p><p>"We think there is a kind of pushing and bulldozing away of a hot basal layer of the mantle, giving rise to small plumes at the edges," Hutko said.</p><p>The study used seismic data from earthquakes in South America that were recorded at seismographic stations in the western United States. The researchers analyzed the data using imaging techniques adapted from those used in oil exploration to study complex structures in the crust.</p><p>"The oil industry has been using these techniques for decades, but only recently have we been able to exploit them for the deep Earth because of new data available from the seismographic network," Hutko said.</p><p>In addition to Hutko and Lay, the other authors of the <i>Nature</i> paper are Edward Garnero of Arizona State University and Justin Revenaugh of the University of Minnesota.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Hutko at ahutko@pmc.ucsc.edu and Lay at (831) 459-3164 or thorne@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p><p><b>Images:</b> A color graphic depicting the folded slab is available.

Thorsett, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has served as acting dean of <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu">physical and biological sciences</a> since 2005, when the previous dean, David Kliger, was appointed campus provost and executive vice chancellor. 

<p>"Professor Thorsett has shown himself to be an exceptional leader with well-developed management skills," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "He has a strong commitment to diversity and a genuine interest in the well-being of all the disciplines for which he will be responsible."</p>
<p>Thorsett's accomplishments as acting dean include a newly updated academic plan; leadership of the campus's California Teach Program to increase the number and quality of science and math teachers in California schools; and the establishment of a task force designed to study the climate for women faculty in the division, one goal of which is to promote women and minorities into academic leadership roles.</p>
<p>"I'm honored and delighted to have this chance to work with my colleagues from the science division and across the campus on building and strengthening our educational and research programs," Thorsett said. "Our students and faculty already make important contributions to environmental science, biomedical science, and the development of advanced technologies. An important goal for me will be to better connect our programs to partners both inside and outside our local region who share our interest in these societally important research areas."</p>
<p>Thorsett's considerable administrative experience at UCSC includes service as associate dean in the division and chair and associate chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He also chaired the Academic Senate Committee on Research and served for two years as the Senate's Parliamentarian. In addition, he has been a member and subcommittee chair for the University-wide Committee on Research Policy and has served on numerous national and international advisory and review committees and panels.</p>
<p>The author of more than 100 scientific publications, primarily on radio pulsars and gamma-ray bursts, Thorsett has made important contributions in astronomy and astrophysics. He has used radio pulsar timing to confirm aspects of general relativity and to investigate binary systems, neutron star masses, and planets around pulsars. Thorsett uses all of the major national radio telescope facilities in his research, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope, and he is a core member of the science teams of two major NASA satellites for high-energy astrophysics (GLAST and NuSTAR).</p>
<p>Thorsett earned a B.A. in mathematics from Carleton College and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Princeton University. He was an assistant professor of physics at Princeton University before joining the UCSC faculty in 1999.</p>

The combined gifts in support of the program total $75,000 and will enable the university to provide courses that would otherwise be eliminated due to budget cuts. </p><p>The gift was initiated by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kamil and Talat Hasan, who put together a group of 15 donors who have each committed $1,000 a year for the next five years to support the language classes. Kamil Hasan noted that the Hindi/Urdu language program is the anchor for UC Santa Cruz's South Asia initiative--a project established in 1999 to create an enduring resource for understanding the region and its cultures. "History, economics, literature, music-they all depend on knowledge of these languages," he said.</p><p>The addition of second-year Hindi/Urdu courses provides the essential language preparation necessary for UC Santa Cruz students who plan to continue their education in graduate programs. Funding for the classes initially began in January, and two students have already benefited from the generosity of the donors. Maia Ramnath, a graduate student in history, and Max Bruce, a 2005 graduate in philosophy, were just awarded fellowships to study Urdu language at the American Institute of Indian Studies program in India, after completing two years of Hindi/Urdu study at UCSC.</p><p>The Hasans hosted a dinner in April at the India Community Center in Milpitas to thank the donors and give them a chance to meet UCSC's chancellor Denice D. Denton, language program chair Gildas Hamel, interim dean of humanities Gary Lease, and Hindi/Urdu lecturer John Mock. </p><p>"It was a very positive event," noted Mock, who teaches all Hindi and Urdu classes at UCSC and holds Ph.D. and M.A. degrees from UC Berkeley in South and Southeast Asian studies, specializing in South Asian languages and literature. "The donors were very happy to see that their gift is already paying off."  Mock's expertise includes the languages and cultures of northern Pakistan, and he speaks Urdu, Wakhi, Hindi, and Nepali, among other languages. </p><p>"I'm so excited that this project has enabled us to bring new donors to UC Santa Cruz," added Talat Hasan. "It was so heartwarming to see the outpouring of support that within two days, we were able to get this group together. We endowed a chair in Indian music several years ago, and our feeling was that knowledge of the languages of North India-Hindi and Urdu (we often call it Hindustani)-is crucial to understand and appreciate that music." </p><p>Interim humanities dean Lease said that the campus was particularly honored and deeply appreciative of the contributions from the donors, noting that they have established "an absolutely essential foundation for further and expanded studies of the Indic subcontinent." </p><p>"This gift ensures five years of support for the instruction of Hindi/Urdu, and perhaps even more importantly, it provides us with precious breathing room to seek a more permanent ongoing funding base for South Asian studies at UC Santa Cruz," Lease added.</p><p>					</p><p>The consortium of donors includes: Prakash Agarwal, Anil and Sonali Batra, Anil Godhwani, Gautam Godhwani, Kamil and Talat Hasan, Sridar and Anita Iyengar, Anuradha Luther Maitra, Javed and Shaheena Khan, Arjun and Kiran Malhotra, Asha Jadeja and Rajeev Motwani, Venktesh and Abha Shukla, and Sanjay and Suniti Subhedar, Vish Mishra, Zafar Hamdani, and Raj Jaswa.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fef388072704601a012ff70068cdf"><name>875</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two geographic sites in Antarctica named in honor of UCSC biologists</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1148454000000</start-date><display-name>Two geographic sites in...</display-name><path>/2006/05/875</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/05/875</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338189060</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338189060</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Costa Spur and Terrie Bluff, once nameless features of the austere Antarctic landscape, have now been officially named in honor of Daniel Costa and Terrie Williams, professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Both scientists have done extensive field research on marine mammals in Antarctica. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names approved the names last year, but Costa and Williams only recently found out about the honor when they received official letters and photos of the sites. </p><p>"It was a complete surprise," Costa said.</p><p>Costa Spur, Antarctica, is described as follows: "Costa Spur is a prominent spur located 4 miles southwest of Quetin Head, Daniell Peninsula, Borchgrevink Coast. The spur descends eastward to the Ross Sea and marks the southern extent of Mandible Cirque."</p><p>Costa studied seals at McMurdo Sound, South Georgia, and Livingston Island for seven field seasons starting in 1978. He was chief scientist aboard the research ship <i>L. M. Gould</i> for two winter cruises associated with the U.S. Southern Ocean GLOBEC projects in 2001 and 2002.</p><p>Terrie Bluff, Antarctica, is located on the side of Mt. Terror overlooking a large penguin rookery, Williams said. The official description is as follows: "Terrie Bluff is a rock bluff that rises to 1,000 meters in height. It is located 1.5 miles south-southeast of Ainley Peak, Kyle Hills on Ross Island. The steep rock bluff face marks the eastern end of a mound-shaped and mostly ice-covered elevation 0.5 mile northwest of Detrick Peak."</p><p>Williams was a U.S. Antarctic Program coprincipal investigator of hunting behavior of free-ranging Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound sea ice areas for several seasons between 1984 and 2002. </p><p>"The cool thing about Terrie Bluff is that it's not far from our research site, so we can go see it the next time we're down there," Williams said.</p><p>The geographic names and descriptions will be published in future editions of the Antarctic Gazetteer and will also be available through the U.S. Geographic Names Information System (<a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov">http://geonames.usgs.gov</a>).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ff0938072704601a012ff0f99268b"><name>876</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Class of 2006's commencement exercises take place June 16-18</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495; jrburns@ucsc.edu)</author><keywords>commencement, graduation ceremonies, uc santa cruz, university of california santa cruz, ucsc, steven hawley, steve wozniak, john laird</keywords><start-date>1148626800000</start-date><display-name>Class of 2006's commencement...</display-name><path>/2006/05/876</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/05/876</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338189403</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338189403</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A former NASA astronaut, the cofounder of Apple Computer, and a member of the California Assembly will be among the featured speakers when the Class of 2006's commencement exercises take place at the University of California, Santa Cruz on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, June 16-18.</p>

According to a new study, this reorientation process could explain the polar location of a region where NASA's Cassini spacecraft recently observed icy jets and plumes indicating active geysers of water vapor spewing from the moon's surface.</p><p>"When we saw the Cassini results, we were surprised that this hot spot was located at the pole. So we set out to explain how it could end up at the pole if it didn't start there," said Francis Nimmo, assistant professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Coauthor Robert Pappalardo worked on the study while at the University of Colorado and is now at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Nimmo and Pappalardo have proposed a reorientation process driven by an upwelling of warm, low-density material inside Enceladus. A similar reorientation process may also have operated on other small moons in the solar system, such as Uranus's moon Miranda, they said. The researchers described their findings in a paper published in the June 1 issue of the journal <i>Nature.</i></p><p>Nimmo and Pappalardo calculated the effects of a low-density blob beneath the surface of Enceladus and showed that this could indeed cause the moon to roll over and put the low-density blob at the pole. Rotating bodies, including planets and moons, are most stable if most of their mass is close to the equator. Therefore, any redistribution of mass within the object can cause instability with respect to the axis of rotation. The resulting reorientation will tend to position excess mass at the equator and, conversely, areas of low density at the poles, Nimmo said. </p><p>"The whole body rolls over, while the spin axis stays fixed," he said.</p><p>An upwelling of warm, low-density material could also help to explain the high heat flux and striking surface features observed at Enceladus's south pole. These features include not only geysers, but also a "tiger stripe" pattern suggesting fault lines caused by tectonic stress. </p><p>"The whole area is hotter than the rest of the moon, and the stripes are hotter than the surrounding surface, suggesting that there is a concentration of warm material below the surface," Nimmo said.</p><p>Internal heating of Enceladus probably results from its eccentric orbit around Saturn. The gravitational pull Enceladus feels from Saturn changes in the course of its orbit, and the resulting tidal forces generate heat inside the moon.</p><p>"Enceladus gets squeezed and stretched by tidal forces, and that mechanical energy is transformed into heat energy in the interior," Nimmo said.</p><p>The upwelling blob (called a "diapir") may be within either the icy shell or the underlying rocky core of Enceladus, he said. In either case, as the material heats up it expands and becomes less dense, then rises toward the surface. </p><p>The reorientation scenario leads to testable predictions, Nimmo said. For example, the leading hemisphere of a moon as it travels through space should have more impact craters than the trailing hemisphere. But if the moon rolls over, the pattern of impact craters will also be reoriented. A low-density mass may also produce an observable anomaly in the moon's gravitational field. </p><p>Additional observations of Enceladus are planned for the Cassini mission and should enable the researchers to test these predictions, Nimmo said.</p><p>This research was supported by grants from NASA.
