Last year, they used a nest box on the PG&amp;E building, where a webcam installed by PG&amp;E and scientists from the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG) enabled scientists and viewers from around the world to watch the falcons raise their young. This year, the pair laid four eggs on a ledge across the street from the PG&amp;E building. A new and improved webcam, with sharper images and the ability to pan and zoom around the nest, has been set up at the new location, and PG&amp;E has created a wireless link to connect the camera with existing infrastructure at PG&amp;E headquarters so that Internet viewing can continue.</p>
<p>Falcon fans who want a firsthand look into the lives of these peregrines can access a special link to the "peregrine cam" on SCPBRG's web site (http://www.scpbrg.org). This site provides visitors with a bird's-eye view of the falcons as they care for their eggs and later raise their eyases in the city. The SCPBRG also hosts a discussion group on its web site to enhance public understanding of the peregrines and their behavior.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory in Santa Cruz, SCPBRG researchers are releasing to the wild three young peregrine falcons that were reared in captivity. Visitors to the lab can observe the young falcons as they test their wings, perch on lab buildings, and make daily visits to the nest box for food provided by attendants. SCPBRG has released more than 1,000 peregrine falcons to the wild since 1975.</p>
<p>"The releases not only add peregrine falcons to the wild population, but doing it at Long Marine Lab provides an opportunity for public viewing and for UCSC students to get hands-on conservation biology experience," said Glenn Stewart, a program manager for the SCPBRG.</p>
<p>In the wild, peregrine falcons usually fledge (fly for the first time) from nests on cliff faces when they are six weeks old. On March 24, Stewart put three captive-reared young in a simulated nest (called a hack box) on the lab's Center for Ocean Health Building. One week later, he opened the box to allow the birds to fledge. The birds will return to the box for food until they learn to hunt on their own, a process that usually takes six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Peregrines often nest on tall city structures that are similar to the sheer cliffs they prefer in nature. They began using PG&amp;E's building in San Francisco as a perch in the mid 1980s. SCPBRG scientists placed a nest box on the ledge of the high-rise with hopes that someday peregrines might nest there.</p>
<p>George and Gracie first staked the urban wilderness of San Francisco's Financial District as their territory in 2003 and selected PG&amp;E's building as their nesting site. Since then, the utility has teamed up with SCPBRG scientists to look after the birds, which are the fastest animals on the planet.</p>
<p>In 2004, the peregrine couple successfully hatched two eggs at the nest and later returned in 2005 to raise four more eyases. The events created lots of excitement for birdwatchers throughout San Francisco's Financial District as they witnessed the young peregrines' first flights in the city.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E made a charitable contribution of $35,000 to SCPBRG this year to cover the cost of the new web camera and associated computer equipment. Over a million hits to the peregrine cam were recorded from early March to early May last year, and the new equipment will help accommodate the large number of expected visitors to the site. PG&amp;E's contribution will also help fund SCPBRG's educational outreach program, which each year educates 8,000 to 10,000 students in grades K-12 about science, nature, and careers in science.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 235 nesting pairs of peregrine falcons in California, up from just two known nesting pairs in 1970. At that time, there were no known nesting pairs east of the Mississippi. The efforts of SCPBRG scientists were instrumental in the recovery of the West Coast peregrine falcon population, and similar efforts in other parts of the country also paid off. The peregrine falcon was removed from the federal endangered species list in 1999, but is still listed as an endangered species in California.</p>

A new study has found dramatic differences in contaminant levels between two closely related albatross species that forage in different areas of the North Pacific. Researchers also found that levels of PCBs and DDT have increased in both species over the past ten years.</p><p>The differences in contaminant levels between black-footed and Laysan albatrosses indicate regional differences in the contamination of North Pacific waters, said Myra Finkelstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the study. </p><p>"The black-footed albatrosses forage mostly in the California Current, whereas the Laysan albatrosses forage at higher latitudes near Alaska. So it appears that the California Current system has significantly higher concentrations of these contaminants," Finkelstein said. </p><p>The researchers published their findings in the April issue of the journal Ecological Applications.</p><p>Mercury and organochlorine compounds such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), DDT, and related compounds persist in the environment for a long time and build up in the tissues of animals high on the food chain. Analysis of blood samples showed that concentrations of these compounds in black-footed albatrosses were 370 to 460 percent higher than in Laysan albatrosses. </p><p>The two species breed at the same sites in the Hawaiian Islands. But when they leave their breeding colonies on foraging trips, the black-footed albatrosses head northeast toward the West Coast of North America, while Laysan albatrosses head northwest toward the northern and western regions of the North Pacific. </p><p>Black-footed and Laysan albatrosses both consume a mixed diet of squid, fish, and fish eggs. Finkelstein analyzed nitrogen isotope ratios in the two species--an indicator of an animal's "trophic level," or how high it is on the food chain--and found no significant difference.</p><p>"Biomagnification means that you get higher concentrations of these compounds as you go up the food chain, but these species appear to be feeding at the same trophic level. We saw huge differences in contaminant levels, which we attribute, at least in part, to the differences in foraging patterns between the two species," Finkelstein said.</p><p>The high contaminant load in black-footed albatrosses foraging in the California Current probably reflects the long history of industrial and agricultural discharges along the West Coast, Finkelstein said. But she added that the distribution and transport of contaminants in the North Pacific involves processes that are still not fully understood. </p><p>Concentrations of DDE (the main breakdown product of DDT) and PCBs in both black-footed and Laysan albatrosses were 130 to 360 percent higher in the samples Finkelstein collected in 2000 and 2001 than in samples collected by previous researchers in 1991 and 1992. The increases were much greater in black-footed albatrosses than in Laysan albatrosses, Finkelstein noted. DDE concentrations, for example, increased 360 percent in black-footed and 170 percent in Laysan albatrosses.</p><p>Many countries do not regulate the manufacture and use of PCBs and DDT as strictly as the United States does now, and these compounds continue to be released into the marine environment. </p><p>"The increases we saw compared with ten years ago probably reflect the ongoing use of these chemicals in countries that border the Pacific," Finkelstein said. </p><p>The biggest current threat to albatross populations in the North Pacific is the longline fishing industry, which kills significant numbers of both black-footed and Laysan albatrosses. But the contaminants measured in this study may also take a toll. Comparable levels of these contaminants in other species, such as herring gulls and Caspian terns in the Great Lakes region, have been associated with a variety of adverse effects, including reproductive deformities, endocrine disruption, and immune system dysfunction. </p><p>"It is very difficult to show a cause-and-effect link in a wild population, but there is evidence of health impacts in other species at these contaminant levels," Finkelstein said. </p><p>Humans are exposed to the same contaminants when they eat seafood, she added. </p><p>"It is important to realize that these contaminants have long-term effects, and we are only beginning to understand many of the subtle effects they can have, such as endocrine disruption and effects on the immune system," she said. "A lot of people think this issue has been taken care of, but it is still very much a problem." </p><p>Finkelstein, who earned a Ph.D. in ocean sciences at UCSC in 2003, conducted this study as part of her thesis research. Her advisers were Donald Croll, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Donald Smith, professor of environmental toxicology. In addition to Croll and Smith, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC researchers Bradford Keitt and Bernie Tershy; Walter Jarman of the U.N. Environmental Program; Sue Rodriguez-Pastor of the University of Colorado, Boulder; David Anderson of Wake Forest University; and Paul Sievert of the U.S. Geological Survey.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Finkelstein at (831) 459-4581 or myraf@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fc1bc8072704601a012ff494d334f"><name>847</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC receives funding for training grants from stem cell institute</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1144652400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC receives funding for...</display-name><path>/2006/04/847</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/847</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338177404</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338177404</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has received $375,000 from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to fund the first year of a new training program in stem cell research. CIRM announced today that it has distributed $12.1 million in grants to 16 California institutions as part of the CIRM Training Program.</p><p>At UCSC, the program will support the training of three predoctoral fellows (graduate students) and three postdoctoral fellows. Faculty in the Departments of Biomolecular Engineering and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology are involved in the program. </p><p>"It's exciting to see this program under way," said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UCSC training program. "It is a very forward-looking initiative for us, one that will definitely help prepare students for future biomedical careers."</p><p>Funding for the grants was drawn from the sale of $14 million of bond anticipation notes (BANs) to six California philanthropic entities. The California Stem Cell Research and Cures Finance Committee approved the BANs in early April. The Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee (ICOC), the agency's governing board, had approved training grant applications on September 9, 2005, but funding for the grants could not be awarded due to litigation impeding the state's ability to sell approved General Obligation bonds. </p><p>"This is an exhilarating day for the scientists, patients, and the millions of Californians who support stem cell research," said ICOC chairman Robert Klein. "CIRM was created to fund science in the service of therapies, and today we're making our first grants. These grants are an investment in human capital. They will train the next generation of scientists."</p><p>The CIRM Training Program will educate fellows from a variety of scientific backgrounds, including computation and molecular biology, nanotechnology, and clinical medicine. All programs are required to offer at least one course in stem cell biology and disease as well as a course in the social, legal, and ethical implications of stem cell research. </p><p>Preparations for the program have been under way for several months at UCSC, where various campus units have come together to provide additional funding. The campus is establishing new dedicated laboratory space for stem cell research and training and has hired a lab manager, and faculty are planning the new courses. </p><p>The UCSC stem cell training program is cosponsoring a lecture and discussion on the ethics of stem cell research this month. Laurie Zoloth, professor of medical ethics and humanities and of religion at Northwestern University, will speak at the event on Monday, April 17, from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center on the UCSC campus. The lecture is free and open to the public.</p><p>CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act (Proposition 71). The institute is responsible for disbursing $3 billion in State funds for stem cell research to California universities and research institutions over the next ten years and is overseen and governed by the ICOC.

Her most recent novel Caramelo, was named a notable book of the year by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and San Francisco Chronicle, among others. She lives in San Antonio, Texas. </p><p>The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Distinguished Lecture Award honors the work of one of the first openly lesbian Chicana writers. A Santa Cruz resident, Anzaldúa published essays, poetry, short stories, interviews, anthologies and children's books and was considered a bold feminist thinker and social activist before her death in 2004. She wrote the landmark Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, which was named one of the 100 Best Books of the Century by Hungry Mind Review and Utne Reader. Anzaldúa was awarded a posthumous Ph.D. in literature from UCSC.</p><p>"Sandra Cisneros embodies the spirit of creativity, struggle, and intellectual honesty that shaped Gloria's work and life," said CLRC director Aida Hurtado, a professor of psychology at UCSC. </p><p> "Cisneros' work, like Gloria's, has transformed the way the world understands what it means to be Chicana," said Marcia Ochoa, assistant professor of community studies and a member of the event organizing committee. </p><p>The event is being sponsored by three Chicano/Latino organizations at UCSC: the CLRC, El Centro, and the Latino Alumni Network.</p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fc48d8072704601a012ff8317248e"><name>849</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC physicist Michael Dine awarded Guggenheim Fellowship</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1144738800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC physicist Michael Dine...</display-name><path>/2006/04/849</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/849</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338178108</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338178108</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Michael Dine, professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been awarded a 2006 Guggenheim Fellowship.

The rest of the year he will spend at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. </p><p>The focus of Dine's work during his sabbatical will be to prepare for interpreting new experimental results expected from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an international facility now under construction in Geneva, Switzerland, which is scheduled to begin operation in 2007. The LHC will be the highest-energy instrument for particle physics research in the world, and physicists hope it will help them resolve many unanswered questions about the physics of elementary particles.</p><p>"There are good reasons to think that the LHC will produce major discoveries," Dine said.</p><p>Dine has made major contributions in the areas of supersymmetry, string theory, and other efforts to develop a "new physics" beyond the standard model of particle physics. The standard model is a very successful theory explaining the interactions of elementary particles, yet it is known to be incomplete. Ideas developed by Dine and others have led to predictions that will be tested for the first time in experiments conducted at the LHC. Dine is engaged in a number of projects exploring the experimental possibilities for the LHC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fc6158072704601a012ff0f29f811"><name>850</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seymour Center unveils new exhibit on fisheries research</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1144825200000</start-date><display-name>Seymour Center unveils new...</display-name><path>/2006/04/850</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/850</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338178509</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338178509</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>What is an otolith? How long do rockfish live? What affects salmon populations? The number of people who can answer these questions is about to increase dramatically, thanks to a new exhibit on fisheries research at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center in Santa Cruz. </p><p>The exhibit will be officially "unveiled" on Friday, April 21, with free admission to the Seymour Center from 3 to 5 p.m., light refreshments, and remarks from local marine scientists. </p><p>The new exhibit features the work of scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Santa Cruz Laboratory. The NMFS lab is located next to UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, home of the Seymour Center. According to the volunteer docents who lead tours and interpret exhibits at the Seymour Center, visitors began asking questions about what goes on at the NMFS lab as soon as it opened in 2000. </p><p>NMFS is an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is sometimes called "NOAA Fisheries." Scientists at the Santa Cruz lab study Pacific Coast groundfish (including rockfish and other bottom-dwellers) and Pacific salmon and steelhead. Their findings influence decisions about the management of important fisheries and protection of threatened and endangered species. </p><p>Wendelin Montciel, visitor programs manager at the Seymour Center, worked closely with a team from the NMFS lab to develop the new exhibit. The kid-friendly, interactive exhibit is designed to appeal to various age groups and includes hands-on activities and three-dimensional models, as well as text and image panels, Montciel said. </p><p>One aspect of the exhibit is a comparison of the life histories of salmon and rockfish, showing how scientific research provides the information needed to plan successful strategies for managing fisheries. </p><p>Both salmon and rockfish are popular with commercial and recreational fishers, but their life histories are dramatically different. Salmon are born in freshwater streams, migrate to the ocean, live four to six years, grow up to 48 inches, and return to the streams where they hatched to spawn. Rockfish are born in the coastal ocean, grow slowly to 18 inches, reach sexual maturity at age 20, give birth to live young each year, and can live to be more than 100 years old. Management strategies for these species must take into account these differences in their life histories.</p><p>Another part of the exhibit explains what an otolith is (it's an ear bone that plays a role in hearing and balance) and how scientists can use otoliths to learn valuable information about individual fish. A third aspect of the exhibit is called "Be a Scientist." It features images of NMFS scientists as children who grew up pursuing their interest in marine science and gives kids a fun opportunity to picture themselves as scientists.</p><p>The Seymour Center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for students and seniors, and $4 for children ages 4 to 16. Admission is free the first Tuesday of each month. The center will be closed for the Easter holiday on Sunday, April 16.

But don't despair--this year's UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Annual Spring Plant Sale features a range of hard-to-find organic annuals, perennials, and vegetable starts.</p>
<p>The theme of this year's sale is "Granny's Favorites: Old Fashioned Plants and Heirlooms." The sale takes place Saturday, May 6, and Sunday, May 7, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets in Santa Cruz. Hours are 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday. Only cash and checks will be accepted. Members of the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10 percent discount and enjoy early admission on Saturday starting at 9 a.m.; memberships will be available during the sale.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the unusual heirloom varieties that will be available are flowers such as 'Danebrog Lace,' a poppy variety with a red exterior and an elaborate cream inside. Also on sale will be the Centaurea americana 'Basket Flower'--an intriguing bloom that combines shades of gold and pink--and 'Whirly Bird Mahogany,' a deep, dark-red nasturtium unlike the more typical orange flowers.</p>
<p>Rare perennials include several raspberry varieties--the prodigious 'Heritage' and the fragrant 'Autumn Bliss' among them--as well as standouts such as Iris unguiclaris, a beardless iris that blooms mid-December to mid-February. A range of California native perennials will also be available, including flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) that blooms in March, and white sage (Salvia apiana) that is used in ceremonial smudge sticks.</p>
<p>As always, the sale offers a wide selection of vegetable starts. Heirloom varieties of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants will be available, as will a broad assortment of unusual lettuces both mild and spicy. Many types of Asian vegetables still unfamiliar to some will also be there, including bok choy, baby bok choy, and tatsoi.</p>
<p>The sale is the largest all-organic event of its kind in the Monterey Bay Area. All of the herbs, flowers, and vegetable starts were propagated using organic methods. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides were used in growing the plants from seed, and no artificial growth hormones were used to stimulate root development.</p>
<p>The sale benefits the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening. For more information about the Spring Plant Sale or the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden, call (831) 459-3240 or send e-mail to jonitann@ucsc.edu.</p>

Hamilton obtained the only good record of local strong ground motion from the great earthquake that devastated San Francisco that day. </p><p>Astronomers at Lick Observatory recently discovered what appears to be the original tracing of the 1906 earthquake from the Mt. Hamilton seismograph. The Mt. Hamilton tracing provided the most scientifically useful local record of the event and was reproduced in the official state report on the earthquake (known as the Lawson Report). The original has now been archivally mounted and is being put on display in the main building at Lick Observatory.</p><p>"It is a tangible link to April 18, 1906, and has the fascination of an artifact that connects us across many years to an important event," said Tony Misch, support astronomer at Lick Observatory, who found the tracing in the "plate vault" where old photographic plates from astronomical observations are stored.</p><p>"It is actually quite a beautiful artifact," added Remington Stone, recently retired operations manager at Lick Observatory, who initiated the search for the observatory's seismographic records from 1906. </p><p>The instrument at Mt. Hamilton that recorded the earthquake was a Ewing three-component seismograph, which made tracings on smoked glass plates. A permanent photographic record was then obtained, probably by placing the glass plate on photosensitive paper and exposing it to light, according to seismologist Robert Uhrhammer of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. </p><p>The smoked glass recording plates were routinely wiped clean, resmoked, and reused, Uhrhammer said. The tracing now on display shows wavy blue background lines in a pattern typically seen on photographic copies of smoked-glass seismograms. The darker seismic traces were also originally light blue and were traced in ink during the annotation process, he said.</p><p>"All the evidence indicates that it is indeed the original tracing of the Mt. Hamilton Ewing three-component seismogram record of the 1906 earthquake," Uhrhammer said.</p><p>The seismographic station at Mt. Hamilton was established in 1887 by the first director of Lick Observatory, Edward S.

But the development of an unfertilized egg into an adult (called parthenogenesis) remains a mysterious process. </p><p>One mystery has been the origin of the centrosome, an essential cellular component that is ordinarily derived from the sperm after fertilization. A new study led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, describes a remarkable process by which the egg cells of Hymenopteran insects make new centrosomes from scratch. The process involves enigmatic cellular structures called accessory nuclei, the function of which has not been explained since they were first discovered in the 1960s.</p><p>"Centrosomes arise from other centrosomes through duplication, but there is no centrosome in the egg that could give rise to new ones. We found that the accessory nuclei seed the formation of new centrosomes in unfertilized eggs," said Patrick Ferree, a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC.</p><p>Ferree is first author of a paper describing the new findings in the April 18 issue of the journal <i>Current Biology</i>. Coauthor William Sullivan, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC, said the findings have implications for understanding basic cell biology, the evolution of Hymenopteran insects, and centrosomal anomalies in cancer cells. The study also shows just how much remains to be discovered about the diversity of life at the cellular level, he said.</p><p>"You would think we'd have identified all the structures in the cell by now, but 90 percent of the material in cell biology textbooks comes from research on nine or ten organisms," Sullivan said. "Every time I look at a honeybee now, I think about these amazing structures they have, and it implies that among the millions of other species there must be cellular mechanisms we haven't even imagined."</p><p>Centrosomes help orchestrate cell division, building an apparatus of microtubules called the mitotic spindle, which pulls apart the duplicated chromosomes so that each of the two daughter cells gets a complete set of chromosomes. The centrosome contains about a hundred different proteins, including the main protein for making microtubules, called gamma tubulin. </p><p>The UCSC researchers studied the development of centrosomes in the eggs of two parasitic wasps (<i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> and <i>Muscidifurax uniraptor</i>). Using fluorescently labeled antibodies that recognize and bind to gamma tubulin and other centrosomal proteins, they demonstrated the presence of these proteins in accessory nuclei and showed that the accessory nuclei appear to give rise to centrosomes. </p><p>Accessory nuclei bud off from the membrane of the nucleus, the cellular structure that contains the chromosomes. By the time the egg is fully developed, it contains several hundred accessory nuclei that look much like the nucleus except that they don't contain chromosomes. Late in the development of the egg cell, the accessory nuclei disintegrate and centrosomes appear in the same locations in the cell.</p><p>"Right before the egg is laid, the membranes of the accessory nuclei break down, and at the same time the centrosomes begin to form," Ferree said. </p><p>One of the most striking aspects of this mechanism is the large number of accessory nuclei and centrosomes that form in the developing eggs of these Hymenopteran insects.</p><p>"You only need two centrosomes, and they make hundreds of them. So they go through a lot of work to make a male," Sullivan said. "A lot of energy goes into making these centrosomes, and if the egg gets fertilized they don't use them--the centrosome from the sperm is used preferentially."</p><p>Centrosomes remain somewhat mysterious structures, Ferree said, but researchers may be able to learn more about them by purifying accessory vesicles and studying their protein components. </p><p>Accessory nuclei have been observed in other species besides Hymenopteran insects, and they may have other functions in addition to making centrosomes, he said. They may also hold clues to the evolutionary origin of the Hymenoptera. Because the males of these insects develop from unfertilized eggs, they have half the number of chromosomes that females have--in technical terms, the males are haploid and the females are diploid. </p><p>This situation, known as haplodiploidy, results in interesting genetic relationships that are thought to underlie the complex social behavior of Hymenopteran insects. One of the key steps in the evolution of social insects, therefore, may have been the development of a mechanism for making centrosomes from scratch.</p><p>"The Hymenoptera were probably derived from a species that had accessory nuclei, and in the evolution of haplodiploidy the accessory nuclei were co-opted as a way of building centrosomes," Sullivan said.</p><p>In addition to Ferree and Sullivan, the other coauthors of the paper are Kent McDonald, a researcher in the Electron Microscope Laboratory at UC Berkeley, and Barbara Fasulo, a postdoctoral fellow in Sullivan's lab at UCSC. This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Ferree at (831) 459-3402 or ferree@biology.ucsc.edu and Sullivan at (831) 459-4295 or sullivan@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fcf288072704601a012fff6735a36"><name>855</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to hold 16th annual Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting on Saturday, April 22</title><author>Allison Garcia (831) 459-3966; acgarcia@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1145257200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to hold 16th...</display-name><path>/2006/04/855</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/855</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338180854</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338180854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Alumni Association's popular annual Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting will be held this Saturday, April 22, and the public is invited.

<p>Like parents, education researcher Doris Ash sees facilities like the Exploratorium, Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium as pathways that help all cross sections of the community learn about science while having a good time.</p>
<p>"Museums make science accessible and engaging," said Ash, an assistant professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Visitors sometimes don't recognize they're 'doing science,' but they are."</p>
<p>Called "informal science education," the learning that takes place at aquaria, zoos, and natural history museums enriches classroom learning and engages people in ways that schools sometimes can't. Such venues have become laboratories for Ash and other researchers eager to gauge the impact of museums on the learning process.</p>
<p>Ash recently received a $1.8 million grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct a five-year study of informal science education with Judith Lombana, vice president of research and institutional development at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry (MOSI) in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>"One hundred years ago, natural history museums were where the public learned most of what they knew about the natural world and conservation," said Ash. "There's value in looking at real objects and living things. It enhances the quality of learning in ways we don't even understand."</p>
<p>Ash, a trained biologist and former classroom teacher, is impressed by the scientific reasoning that takes place in museums. "People start asking questions, observing features, comparing and categorizing what they see, and they make connections," said Ash, who is especially interested in the impact of informal science learning on "nontraditional" visitors, including the poor and those with limited or no English skills.</p>
<p>"Families who can't read the display materials because they don't speak English are still very engaged in making sense of what they're seeing," she added. "The life sciences are so profound, and we all know something about them. In the absence of more specific knowledge, parents enter the conversation and families work together to bring meaning to the experience."</p>
<p>Cognitive and developmental psychologists have determined that even young children can make connections about living things, noting for example that they grow and reproduce. Less is known about when and how people grasp notions of form and function, which are other ways of reasoning about living things, she said.</p>
<p>At MOSI, Ash's team will videotape families to document and later analyze the interactions that occur among people with different levels of knowledge. Ultimately, her insights into the learning process could help museum educators improve their services and reveal successful strategies that could be carried over into classrooms.</p>
<p>Ash has researched informal science learning at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. She is a member of UCSC's Informal Learning Group, which has extensive expertise working with bilingual and English-speaking families in informal settings. MOSI is at the forefront of museum efforts to enhance educator training and museum programs by participating in research projects with practical applications.</p>

The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Weissman is a professor of pathology and developmental biology and director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Stanford. He has cofounded three companies--SyStemix, StemCells, and Celtrans (now Cellerant)--and now serves as director and chair of the scientific advisory board of Cellerant and member of the scientific advisory board of StemCells.</p><p>Weissman has done pioneering work in stem cell biology. Stem cells are precursor cells that can give rise to a wide variety of specialized cell types and are thought to hold great potential for medical therapies and cures. Weissman's laboratory was the first to isolate mammalian stem cells, identifying the blood-forming stem cells in both mice and humans. His lab went on to define the stages of development between the stem cells and mature blood cells. Weissman's work has led to new treatments for leukemia and lymphoma, and he is in the forefront of efforts to develop adult stem cell therapy for other diseases. </p><p>Weissman is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has received numerous awards, including Stanford's Linus Pauling Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Science, the Medal for Distinguished Contributions to Biomedical Research from the New York Academy of Medicine, the Kovalenko Medal from the National Academy of Sciences Council, and the Pasarow Foundation Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cancer Biology. Weissman earned a B.S. from Montana State College and M.D. from Stanford University. </p><p>The Sinsheimer Distinguished Lectureship in Biology is supported by an endowment from UCSC Chancellor Emeritus Robert L.

They are Harry Berger, Jr., professor emeritus of English literature and history of art and visual culture; David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering; and Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics.</p><p>The 175 new fellows elected this year also include former Presidents George H. W. Bush and William Jefferson Clinton; Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts; Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and Rockefeller University President Sir Paul Nurse; director Martin Scorsese; and conductor Michael Tilson Thomas.</p><p>"It gives me great pleasure to welcome these outstanding leaders in their fields to the academy," said academy president Patricia Meyer Spacks. "Fellows are selected through a highly competitive process that recognizes individuals who have made preeminent contributions to their disciplines and to society at large."</p><p>Berger was recognized for his contributions to literary criticism. A founding faculty member at UCSC, he is known for his wide-ranging and interdisciplinary approach that goes far beyond traditional academic boundaries. Berger studied literature and art history at Yale University, where he earned his B.A. and Ph.D. in English and taught for nine years. He came to UCSC in 1965 and has taught a variety of subjects under the general category of culture theory and Renaissance culture, including Renaissance drama and Shakespeare. In art history, Berger specialized in Italian and Dutch painting and the theory and practice of portraiture. He has published extensively, with a dozen books and more than 80 articles to his credit.</p><p>Haussler was recognized for his work in computer science, including artificial intelligence and information technology. A Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, Haussler directs the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC. He is also affiliated with UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA and is scientific codirector of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research. He has done pioneering work in the fields of computational learning theory and bioinformatics. His research group made vital contributions to the International Human Genome Project and remains at the forefront of the field of computational genomics. </p><p>Haussler is also one of two UCSC faculty members elected to the National Academy of Sciences this week (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=862">separate press release</a>). A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, he earned his B.A. in mathematics from Connecticut College, M.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1986.</p><p>Widom has made important contributions in an area of mathematics called random matrix theory, which is also of great interest to physicists. His work with collaborator Craig Tracy of UC Davis led to the discovery of a new class of distribution functions called Tracy-Widom distributions. Widom and Tracy shared the prestigious George Pólya Prize in 2002 for this work. Widom's early research was in the areas of integral equations and operator theory. </p><p>Widom attended the City College of New York as an undergraduate, then received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the University of Chicago. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1968.</p><p>The American Academy of Arts and Sciences will welcome this year's new class at its annual induction ceremony on October 7 at the academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. Founded in 1780 by John Adams, James Bowdoin, John Hancock, and other scholar-patriots, the academy has elected as Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members the finest minds and most influential leaders from each generation, including George Washington and Ben Franklin in the 18th century, Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the 19th, and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in the 20th. The current membership includes more than 170 Nobel laureates and 50 Pulitzer Prize winners. An independent policy research center, the academy undertakes studies of complex and emerging problems. Current academy research focuses on science and global security; social policy; the humanities and culture; and education.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fdce38072704601a012ff3d312b85"><name>862</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC faculty members elected to National Academy of Sciences</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1146034800000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC faculty members...</display-name><path>/2006/04/862</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/862</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338184339</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338184339</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two faculty members at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were elected to the National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday in recognition of their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.

He has done pioneering work in the fields of computational learning theory and bioinformatics. His research group made vital contributions to the International Human Genome Project and remains at the forefront of the field of computational genomics, exploring the evolution and function of human genes and working to identify and understand all of the biologically important parts of the genome. </p><p>A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Haussler earned his B.A. in mathematics from Connecticut College, M.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1986.</p><p> </p><p>Woosley, a theoretical astrophysicist, is a leading authority on supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, the most violent explosions in the universe. He directs the Center for Supernova Research, funded by the Department of Energy and headquartered at UCSC. His work on the evolution of massive stars and their explosion as supernovae describes how the "heavy" elements needed for life, such as oxygen and iron, are forged and ejected. In addition, Woosley's "collapsar" model of massive star explosions has been identified as the central engine of certain types of gamma-ray bursts in which a huge dying star collapses into a central black hole.</p><p>A fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), Woosley received the APS's Hans Bethe Prize, as well as the American Astronomical Society's Bruno Rossi Prize, in 2005. UCSC's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences honored him with its Outstanding Faculty Award in 2003-04. Woosley earned his B.A. in physics and M.S. and Ph.D. in astrophysics from Rice University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1975 and has served three times as chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p><p>The National Academy of Sciences is a private organization of scientists and engineers dedicated to the furtherance of science and its use for the general welfare. It was established in 1863 by a congressional act of incorporation signed by Abraham Lincoln that calls on the academy to act as an official adviser to the federal government, upon request, in any matter of science or technology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fde7a8072704601a012ffc42b184f"><name>863</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to present Digital Arts and New Media Festival, May 4-7</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1146034800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to...</display-name><path>/2006/04/863</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/04/863</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338184763</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338184763</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media program (DANM) will present "DANM Festival 2006," a four-day series of events that includes exhibitions, performances, symposia, and film screenings from May 4-7. It will include work by national and international artists, expert speakers, and students from the M.F.A. program. Events will take place on campus and at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History.</p>
<p>The festival is designed to showcase UCSC's new presence in the field of digital arts and new media. The DANM program was established in 2004 to address the increasing role of digital technology in the arts and to explore the impact of digital arts on human culture. The innovative new M.F.A. program will graduate its first class this June, and now serves as a center for the development and study of digital media and the cultures that it has helped to create.</p>
<p>"The impetus for the festival originally came from Porter College provost David Evan Jones," said assistant professor of art Ed Osborn. "The idea was to have a big public event, bringing in notable people from out of the area, to increase visibility and serve as a marker to the rest of the world that this program is here at UCSC."</p>
<p>Osborn is one of five DANM faculty members who will lead panels at the festival featuring top researchers in music and sound practice, performing arts, and biotechnology. His symposium, "Audible Terrain: Shifting Ground in Contemporary Sound Practice," will include Nigel Helyer, a sculptor and sound artist from Sydney, Australia, who studies sound and its relation to biology. Other panels will include "The Role of Virtuosity in a Technology-Enhanced Performance," hosted by David Merrill from MIT; and "Algorithmic Methods and Models in the Arts," led by UCSC music professor David Cope.</p>
<p>Music performances will include a presentation by electronic composer and sound-installation artist Laetitia Sonami--best known for her theatrical pieces in which she controls music and sound with a black glove, studded with sensors. There will also be exhibitions of work by top Bay Area media artists Jim Campbell, Paul DeMarinis, and Camille Utterback at the Museum of Art and History that include interactive video installations. "All the works are quite fascinating," Osborn noted.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Santa Cruz Film Festival, the DANM festival will also present screenings of rare historical works that have been influential in the development of digital art, along with films by contemporary artists such as Harun Farocki.</p>
<p>DANM Festival 2006 is sponsored by DANM and Porter College, with promotional support from UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program.
