The event recognizes UCSC faculty who have attained tenure or received promotion and showcases the books that have influenced them.</p>
<p>The faculty and their selected books will be celebrated with a gala reception in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science &amp; Engineering Library on Wednesday, February 8, at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The ceremony will include remarks from UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. Other speakers will include David Kliger, campus provost and executive vice chancellor; Stephen Thorsett, interim dean of physical and biological sciences; and Darrell Long, associate dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. The event is sponsored by the UCSC Libraries, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The honored faculty and the books they have selected are featured on a commemorative web site (http://library.ucsc.edu/science/honor/), which includes descriptions by the faculty members of the significance of their chosen books to their lives and careers. The following is just one example, a description provided by Gregory Laughlin, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, of his chosen book, Inward Bound, by Abraham Pais:</p>
<p>"I encountered this volume by chance in the University of Illinois Physics Library while I was an undergraduate. I was studying for a looming quantum mechanics exam when I noticed the book lying out waiting to be reshelved. I picked it up distractedly, and was immediately hooked (to my definite disadvantage on the quantum mechanics exam, but now that's all water under the bridge). Pais does a wonderful job of describing the historical progression of the understanding of Nature on successively smaller size scales. I found this book to be of great value because of the way it entwines an accurately researched history of science with a masterful discussion of the scientific results themselves."</p>

His lecture is titled "Cante Moro." The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Mackey was selected by UCSC faculty members for the prestigious honor given in recognition of his "extraordinary accomplishments in many fields of scholarly and creative activity." As a poet, literary critic, fiction writer, and journal editor, Mackey has produced a wide variety of work over the past three decades that has earned him national and international recognition. </p><p>Mackey is the author of eight books of poetry, including Four for Trane, Septet for the End of Time, Outlantish, and Song of the Andoumboulou, which are widely regarded as among the most innovative examples of contemporary American experimental writing. His 1985 poetry book, Eroding Witness, was selected for publication in the National Poetry Series. He received a Whiting Writer's Award in 1993 and was elected to the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets in 2001, one of the highest honors in the field of poetry. </p><p>Mackey's two volumes of literary criticism include Paracritical Hinge, published last year by the University of Wisconsin Press, and Discrepant Engagement: Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing (Cambridge University Press, 1993). For the past 30 years, Mackey has also single-handedly served as editor of the literary journal Hambone, which brings together diverse strands of innovative work from both established and emerging writers,</p><p>Known as an authority on the relations between African and African American music and writing, Mackey has edited an influential anthology, Moment's Notice: Jazz in Poetry and Prose (1993), and produced a poetry CD in collaboration with contemporary jazz musicians. He has also completed three novels in a series titled From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate--composed as letters written by a composer/multi-instrumentalist named N, a founding member of a fictional band known as the Mystic Horn Society. And his longtime radio program on Santa Cruz public radio station KUSP,  titled Tanganyika Strut, continues to spotlight African music throughout the world.</p><p>Mackey's innovative work in prose and poetry has attracted widespread notice from scholars, writers, and musicians; he is frequently sought for interviews and to be the subject of Ph.D. dissertations. The acclaimed African and African American literary journal Callaloo even devoted an entire issue to his work.  </p><p>  </p><p>Mackey graduated with High Honors in English from Princeton University in 1969 and completed his Ph.D. at Stanford. He taught at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California, where he directed the Black Studies Program, before joining the UCSC faculty in 1979.  </p><p>For more information, contact Susanna Wrangell or Scott Lupo in the Academic Senate Office at (831) 459-2086 or e-mail: slupo@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f72968072704601a012ff44b275de"><name>806</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California Teach Program launched to boost numbers of highly qualified math and science teachers</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1139209200000</start-date><display-name>California Teach Program launched...</display-name><path>/2006/02/806</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/806</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338157157</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338157157</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The California Teach Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is creating new opportunities for students in mathematics, science, and engineering majors to prepare for careers in teaching. The program is part of the UC systemwide "California Teach" initiative designed to increase the number and quality of science and math teachers in California schools. </p><p>California faces a critical shortfall in the number of highly qualified math and science teachers in the state's secondary school classrooms, according to state officials. At the national level, a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences <i>(Rising Above The Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future)</i> emphasizes the need for vast improvements in K-12 math and science education. The California Teach Program is a direct response to these concerns, said Stephen Thorsett, interim dean of physical and biological sciences, who oversees the program at UCSC.</p><p>"Our goal is to widen the pathways available for science and math undergraduates to go into teaching," Thorsett said.</p><p>First- and second-year students interested in the new program can take a spring-quarter seminar course this year together with a paid internship in a local school. The internships will also be open to students at regional community colleges who plan to transfer to UCSC, said Gretchen Andreasen, director of the UCSC California Teach Resource Center.</p><p>"This is a great opportunity for students to explore the possibility of teaching as a career," Andreasen said. "Students will be placed in a school where they will spend up to five hours per week with a mentor teacher, assisting and observing in middle and high school science and math classes."</p><p>The deadline for applications to the spring-quarter program is March 15. Andreasen noted that participation does not require any long-term commitment. </p><p>"We want to generate interest among students and build enthusiasm for future teaching careers, and also provide support for local schools," she said.</p><p>The long-term goal of the systemwide California Teach Program is to produce 1,000 new science and math teachers for California schools each year. UCSC's portion of that, based on its relative size, is about 75 teachers per year. The campus currently produces about 20 to 25 graduates per year from the Education Department's master's program for secondary school science and math teachers, Andreasen said.</p><p>The California Teach Program was originally conceived as a way for science, math, and engineering majors in the classes of 2009 and later to prepare for careers as secondary school science or math teachers. But many students who are much closer to graduating have also expressed interest in the program, Andreasen said.</p><p>"A lot of students don't start thinking about their career options until they are further along. So we want to figure out how to provide support for sophomores and juniors who are interested in teaching and get them on the path too," she said.</p><p>Each campus is developing its own program to implement the systemwide California Teach initiative. At UCSC, the program is building on the past success of the California Math and Science Teaching program (CMST), which provides fellowships and teacher training for science and math majors in their junior and senior years. CMST is a UC program managed jointly at UCSC by the Departments of Mathematics and Education. </p><p>"CMST has existed for decades and has been a very successful program, and that work will continue through California Teach," Andreasen said.</p><p>CMST coordinator Barbara Sorensen will teach the spring-quarter seminar course for the California Teach Program. Sorensen, a former math teacher at Watsonville High School, said her own experience and feedback from CMST graduates affirm that teaching can be a very rewarding career for students in math and science who receive good teacher training and support. </p><p>Andreasen is also working with the UCSC Education Department to plan a version of the education minor that is aligned with state credentialing requirements for single-subject science and math teachers. </p><p>"We're working toward the creation of an undergraduate program approved for credentialing, but we're not there yet," she said. </p><p>Information about math and science teaching careers and pathways into those careers will be provided at a Saturday Open Lab event at UCSC on March 4. Cosponsored by California Teach, the Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS), and the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), the event will be open to students at UCSC and regional community colleges.

"I am extremely pleased to welcome Donna Murphy to UC Santa Cruz," Denton said. "She brings experience at two major universities and two international organizations that have provided her with a remarkable array of skills that will be instrumental in helping advance our already strong campus. Specifically, Donna has an impressive track record in fundraising, strategy, public affairs, and external relations that will be a real boost for UCSC and our ambitious goals as a nationally distinctive university."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Murphy also expressed enthusiasm. "UC Santa Cruz is an outstanding university built by impressive people who have achieved an outstanding record of accomplishments. It is a privilege to be joining with Chancellor Denton, UCSC's University Relations team, and the entire university community to make UCSC's ambitious goals become real," she said.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Murphy will oversee the Division of University Relations, with responsibility for leading and coordinating the Offices of Development, Alumni Relations, Public Affairs, Special Events, and Community and Governmental Relations.</p>
<p>At Tulane University in New Orleans, Murphy served as the senior associate vice president for Health Sciences Advancement. In that position, she led the planning, implementation, and management of development and alumni relations programs, legislative advocacy, and advancement communications.</p>
<p>Under Murphy's direction, the advancement staff at Tulane increased private support to the Health Sciences Center (HSC) by 36 percent and the number of donors by 1,000 from FY 2002 to 2005 during a period when the stock market and private support of universities nationwide suffered major declines after years of record growth. In this position, Murphy also spearheaded the development of a three-year business plan to prepare for the public launch of a $202 million campaign for the HSC. By the end of 2005, the campaign was 77 percent ($156 million) toward its goal.</p>

In the process, he sheds new light on a little-known but highly significant story of slavery, freedom, and race during the Civil War.</p><p>The idea for the book came to Levine in the late 1980s when he was teaching at the University of Cincinnati and working on another book about the origins of the Civil War.</p><p>"The more I read about this episode, the more I realized how important it was to our understanding of the war; it wasn't just an interesting little footnote," said Levine. "After all, how could the war be about slavery if the Confederates were willing to sacrifice slavery in order to win the war? And it turned out that there was a cornucopia of information on that and related subjects available in letters, government documents, and newspaper articles and editorials."</p><p>Levine traveled throughout the South, combing through archives for newspaper accounts of the war, letters sent to Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders, diaries of officers and troops, and memoirs by and about former slaves. He spent time exploring the internal documents of the Confederate government, which were captured by the Union army and are now stored at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Levine found that Confederate leaders had been receiving--and rejecting--letters from various Southerners suggesting that they arm the slaves since the very beginning of the war. But it was only in November of 1864, after the Confederates were defeated at Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and finally Atlanta, that Davis reversed himself and endorsed the proposal to arm the slaves. The result was a fierce public debate in newspapers, drawing rooms, army regiments, and slave quarters throughout the South.</p><p>The book shows how the idea was proposed out of desperation and military necessity--the Confederates were badly outnumbered, slaves were escaping and joining the Union armies, and the South was close to defeat and to the loss of slavery. But as Levine points out, "the opposition of slave owners was ferocious--even though they were facing defeat and the end of slavery, they would not face those realities. They would not give up their slaves, even to save the Confederate cause itself."</p><p>"Only a tiny handful of slaves responded to the Confederate proposal," Levine added. "They viewed it as an act of desperation and were skeptical of the sincerity of promises of emancipation. The reaction of the slaves generally was 'Why would we fight for the Confederacy; it's not our country? They were very well informed through the grapevine."</p><p>Levine noted that the book is designed to emphasize how important the slaves' actions were during that period of history.</p><p>"The story of the Civil War is usually told as a story of two white armies and two white governments," Levine said. "The popular image is of passive, grateful slaves kneeling at the feet of Father Abraham. But in fact, the slaves were very active in shaping the war and its outcome."</p><p>"There are a lot of revelations in this book," Levine added. "The proposals discussed here provided an early glimmering of how the white South would treat blacks for the next century."</p><p>Levine is the author, coauthor, or editor of six previous books, including Work and Society (1977), Who Built America? (two volumes, 1990, 1992), The Spirit of 1848: German Immigrants, Labor Conflict, and the Coming of the Civil War (1992), and Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of Civil War (rev. ed. 2005). He has been a professor of history at UC Santa Cruz since 1997.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f779d8072704601a012ff545d1f78"><name>814</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz protest no longer on Pentagon's 'credible threat' list</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin (831/459-5190)</author><start-date>1139554800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz protest...</display-name><path>/2006/02/814</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/814</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338158444</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338158444</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elizabeth Irwin</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>emirwin@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Department of Defense has removed mention of a campus demonstration at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from the TALON (Threat and Local Observation Notice) database, following recent efforts by UCSC Chancellor Denice D.

Denton was notified of the action in a letter co-signed by U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who noted they were "relieved to learn that Department of Defense regulations forbid retaining information on Americans engaged in constitutionally protected activities" and that the UCSC protest "had been removed from the TALON database."<br/>
<br/>
<p>The April 5, 2005, protest of military recruiters at a campus career fair had been listed as a "credible threat" on the database managed by the Pentagon's Counterintelligence Field Agency.</p>
<p>After learning from news releases in December of the UCSC event's inclusion on the TALON database, Denton had challenged the listing and asked members of Congress to investigate, noting that "an environment of surveillance and intimidation threatens the core values of universities and of our nation."</p>
<p>The letter announcing the removal of the UCSC event from the TALON listing followed a meeting arranged by Senator Boxer in her Washington, D.C., office Jan. 31. Denton and Lt. Col. Gary Testut, representing the Pentagon, were among the attendees. Denton also expressed her concerns later that day in a meeting with Senator Feinstein.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/pentagon/boxer_feinstein-letter_02-08-06.pdf">letter to Chancellor Denton</a>, Senators Boxer and Feinstein said that Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone has initiated a "comprehensive review of the TALON program to determine if Department of Defense officials violated any regulations governing domestic counterintelligence efforts, and to ascertain whether changes to the program are necessary."</p>
<p>Chancellor Denton and David S. Kliger, campus provost and executive vice chancellor, said they will "continue to do everything in our power to ensure that First Amendment rights are protected on this campus and in our country. We have zero tolerance for violence and incivility, but we vigorously support free expression of opinions, including dissent. Such expressions are hallmarks of a democratic society and are integral to our vital teaching and learning community."</p>
<p>The UCSC protest was one of dozens of protests, demonstrations, and meetings--including one at a Quaker Meeting House in Lake Worth, Florida--around the country listed on the database and revealed in news reports in December.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f79068072704601a012ff874c3337"><name>815</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich to speak at UCSC on Thursday, March 2</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1139900400000</start-date><display-name>Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich...</display-name><path>/2006/02/815</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/815</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338158806</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338158806</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Paul Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population Studies and president of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University, will give the second Fred Keeley Lecture on Environmental Policy at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, March 2.

<p>"The emissions that caused this past episode of global warming probably lasted 10,000 years. By burning fossil fuels, we are likely to emit the same amount over the next three centuries," said James Zachos, professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Zachos presented his findings this week at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in St. Louis. He is a leading expert on the episode of global warming known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), when global temperatures shot up by 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit). This abrupt shift in the Earth's climate took place 55 million years ago at the end of the Paleocene epoch as the result of a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of two greenhouse gases: methane and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Previous estimates put the amount of released carbon at 2 trillion tons, but Zachos showed that more than twice that amount--about 4.5 trillion tons--entered the atmosphere over a period of 10,000 years (<i>Science,</i> June 10, 2005). If present trends continue, this is the same amount of carbon that industries and automobiles will emit during the next 300 years, Zachos said.</p>
<p>Once the carbon is released into the atmosphere, it takes a long time for natural mechanisms, such as ocean absorption and rock weathering, to remove excess carbon from the air and store it in the soil and marine sediments. Weathering of land rocks removes carbon dioxide permanently from the air, but is a slow process requiring tens of thousands of years. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide much more rapidly, but only to a point. The gas first dissolves in the thin surface layer of the ocean, but this surface layer quickly becomes saturated and its ability to absorb more carbon dioxide declines.</p>
<p>Only mixing with the deeper layers can help restore the ability of the surface water to absorb additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But the natural processes that mix and circulate water between the ocean surface and deeper ocean layers work very slowly. A complete "mixing cycle" takes about 500 to 1,000 years, Zachos said.</p>
<p>The greenhouse emissions that triggered the PETM initially exceeded the ocean's absorption capacity, allowing carbon to accumulate in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, humans appear to be adding carbon dioxide to the air at a much faster rate: about the same amount of carbon (4.5 trillion tons), but within a few centuries instead of 10,000 years. What was emitted 55 million years ago over a period of about 20 ocean mixing cycles is now being emitted over a fraction of a cycle.</p>
<p>"The rate at which the ocean is absorbing carbon will soon decrease," Zachos said.</p>
<p>Compounding this concern is the possibility that higher temperatures could retard ocean mixing, further reducing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. This could have the kind of "positive feedback" effect that climate researchers worry about: reduced absorption, leaving more carbon dioxide in the air, causing more warming.</p>
<p>Higher ocean temperatures could also slowly release massive quantities of methane that now lie frozen in marine deposits. A greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, methane in the atmosphere would accelerate global warming even further.</p>
<p>Such positive feedback or "threshold" effects probably drove global warming during the PETM and a few other ancient climate extremes, Zachos said, and they could happen again. It is possible that we already are in the early stages of a similar climate shift, he said.</p>
<p>"Records of past climate change show that change starts slowly and then accelerates," he said. "The system crosses some kind of threshold."</p>
<p>Clues to what happened during the PETM lie buried deep inside the sediment at the bottom of the sea, which Zachos and his colleagues have probed during several cruises of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP). Composed mainly of clay and the carbonate shells of microplankton, this sediment accumulates slowly, but steadily--up to 2 centimeters every millennium--and faithfully records changes in ocean chemistry. The layer of sediment deposited during the PETM, now buried hundreds of meters below the seafloor, tells a clear and compelling story of sudden change and slow recovery, he said.</p>
<p>During the PETM, unknown factors released vast quantities of methane that had been lying frozen in sediment deposits on the ocean floor. After release, most of the methane reacted with dissolved oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which made the seawater more acidic. Acidic seawater corrodes the carbonate shells of microplankton, dissolving them before they can reach the ocean floor and reducing the carbonate content of marine sediment.</p>
<p>Zachos led an international team of scientists that analyzed sediment cores recovered from several locations during an ODP cruise in the southeastern Atlantic. Collected at depths ranging from 2.5 to 4.8 kilometers (1.6 to 3.0 miles), each sediment core bore a telltale PETM imprint: a 10- to 30-centimeter layer of dark red carbonate-free clay sandwiched between bright white carbonate-rich layers.</p>
<p>By relating the thickness of the clay layer to the rate of accumulation of marine sediment, Zachos estimated that it took 100,000 years after the PETM for carbon dioxide levels in the air and water to return to normal. This finding is consistent with what geochemists have predicted using models of how the global carbon cycle will respond to carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>"We set out to test the hypotheses put forward by a small group of geochemists who model the global carbon cycle, and our findings support their predictions," Zachos said.

The data are proving useful to both biologists and oceanographers, yielding new information about the migrations and behavior of the animals and about the environments in which they live.</p><p>"We're using these animals as ocean sensors to tell us about oceanographic conditions, and we're also learning how they use the ocean--where they go and what they do," said Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Costa, along with Barbara Block of Stanford University, is a principal investigator on a Census of Marine Life project called Tagging Of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP), which is deploying electronic tags on 23 species of apex predators in the North Pacific Ocean. He is also collaborating with researchers at the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland on a project in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica called Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS). </p><p>Costa and SMRU's Michael Fedak organized several sessions focusing on this area of research at the 2006 Ocean Sciences Meeting, February 20-24, in Honolulu. Costa and other researchers will present the results of tagging studies involving California sea lions, northern elephant seals, tuna, salmon sharks, and albatross in the North Pacific, as well as southern elephant seals, Antarctic fur seals, and crabeater seals in the Southern Ocean. </p><p>California sea lions are proving to be an excellent platform for monitoring oceanographic conditions along the California coast, Costa said. State-of-the-art tags developed at SMRU can now capture an animal's location, swim speed, and the depth and duration of dives, as well as the temperature and salinity of the seawater and how that changes with depth. As the sea lions travel along the coast diving for food, their tags transmit data back to the researchers via satellite.</p><p>"They are a great animal for collecting oceanographic data and giving us updates on ocean conditions in the California Current," Costa said. </p><p>The electronic tags are essentially miniaturized computers with various sensors on them. They can be fixed harmlessly onto the fur of a seal or sea lion, and will stay on for several months before falling off when the animal molts. Data recorded during a dive are transmitted to satellites when the animal comes to the surface to breathe. </p><p>Costa's group has been providing water temperature and salinity data gathered by California sea lions to physical oceanographer Yi Chao at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Chao and his colleagues are incorporating the data into a computer model designed to simulate and predict ocean circulation patterns in the California coastal region. Preliminary results indicate that plugging in the sea lion data substantially increases the predictive capabilities of the model, Costa said. </p><p>"It's like predicting the weather. To get accurate predictions, the weather models have to be constantly updated with new data from weather stations all over the country," he said.</p><p>The researchers are also gaining new insights into the lives of California sea lions, said Michael Weise, a graduate student working with Costa on the sea lion studies.</p><p>"This technology brings a whole new dimension to our understanding of how California sea lions are using their environment," Weise said.</p><p>During 2004 and 2005, for example, the researchers observed unusual movement patterns of sea lions associated with anomalies in sea surface temperatures. Normally, upwelling of cold deep water brings nutrients into the coastal waters off California and supports a highly productive food web. But the 2004-05 season was marked by unusually warm water along the coast, and the sea lions were forced to change their diets and their foraging patterns, Weise said.</p><p>"The sea lions disappeared from Monterey Bay, as did the bait fish. We were only able to tag three male sea lions that year, and they went much farther off shore than usual to find food. They've always been described as a strictly coastal species, but they went as far out as 300 miles from the coast," he said.</p><p>At the same time, Costa's group was also tracking the movements of elephant seals and albatrosses. These species, which typically forage across a broad area of the North Pacific Ocean, showed little change in their movement patterns in 2004 and 2005. As platforms for ocean sensors, northern elephant seals and California sea lions can provide complementary information because of their different foraging patterns, Costa said. </p><p>"Elephant seals provide incredible coverage of the North Pacific, while the sea lions are good along the coastal upwelling region," he said. </p><p>Similar complementarity is provided by southern elephant seals and crabeater seals in the Southern Ocean. Costa led a study of crabeater seals during the Antarctic winters of 2001 and 2002, tagging 34 seals and tracking their foraging patterns. Crabeater seals are specialized for feeding on Antarctic krill and forage along the continental shelf of Antarctica at the edge of the ice pack. </p><p>Southern elephant seals, in contrast, forage widely in the offshore waters. The SEaOS project led by SMRU's Fedak is deploying electronic tags on elephant seals at three locations in the Southern Ocean. The oceanographic data gathered by the seals on their foraging trips from these different locations provide circumpolar coverage of the Southern Ocean, Costa said.</p><p>"We are collecting a tremendous amount of data in this area of the world and working with physical oceanographers to incorporate these data into oceanographic models," he said. </p><p>Researchers can use these Antarctic seal species to obtain oceanographic data for a region of the ocean and times of the year for which there are no good sources of data, Costa said. This is particularly important because of the major role played by the Southern Ocean in the global climate system. </p><p>"Much of the world's weather is determined by what happens in the Antarctic, so understanding the Southern Ocean is a key to understanding global climate," Costa said.</p><p>Costa began using electronic data recorders to study the diving behavior of elephant seals in 1983. Since then, the miniaturization of electronic components and sensors, plus advances in satellite technology, have led to dramatic improvements in the tags. Recent innovations developed at SMRU have greatly improved the ability to pinpoint an animal's geographic location, and researchers are adding new capabilities to the tags, such as measuring the chlorophyll content of the water (an indicator of algal blooms or "primary productivity"). </p><p>"We can now use animals to show us things like the thermal properties and cooling rates of the ocean and the structure of the water column, and they can often get valuable data that would be hard to collect by other means," Costa said.</p><p>For more information on TOPP, visit the program's award-winning web site at <a href="http://www.toppcensus.org">http://www.toppcensus.org</a>.

<p>Held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the annual convocation will begin at 7 p.m. The event, which is free and open to the public, is part of the campus celebration of Black History Month.</p>
<p>Beauchamp's documentary focuses on the 1955 case in which a 14-year-old Chicago boy visiting relatives in Mississippi was murdered for whistling at a white woman in a store. The brutality of the case shocked the world and is considered by many to be a turning point in the African American struggle for civil rights.</p>
<p>"Emmett Till's murder, Emmett Till's case was the catalyst of the American civil rights movement," Beauchamp said in an ABC News interview (http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=735586&amp;page=1) in May 2005. "It was because of him that young Martin Luther King decided to take on the Montgomery bus boycott. It was because of him that Rosa Parks decided not to get up from her seat that day."</p>
<p>Two men were tried and acquitted of Till's murder by an all-white jury. It wasn't until 2004 that the Justice Department reopened the murder case. At the time, the department gave much of the credit for reopening the case to the years of research done by Beauchamp for the documentary. Beauchamp said he believes at least 14 people may have been involved in the kidnapping and murder of Till and that five of them are still alive.</p>
<p>The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till has been well received by critics. It placed third in a recent San Francisco Chronicle "Critical Consensus" listing of current films as reviewed by major American film critics, after Ballet Russes (first) and Brokeback Mountain (second) and ahead of Pride &amp; Prejudice.</p>
<p>Beauchamp will introduce his film and answer questions at two free screenings, one on campus and one in downtown Santa Cruz. The on-campus screening will be at 7 p.m. February 27 in the UC Santa Cruz Media Theater. The downtown showing will be at noon on February 28, the day of the convocation, at the Del Mar Theater in Santa Cruz. While the screenings are free, priority seating will be given to those with tickets. Ticket registration is available online at http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/ or by calling (831) 459-5003. The 70-minute documentary is rated PG-13.</p>
<p>Angela Glover Blackwell's wide-ranging PolicyLink organization has been active in the post-Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort, stressing the importance of involving evacuees and residents in the rebuilding. At no charge, PolicyLink is consulting with the Louisiana Recovery Authority on housing and other rebuilding issues, and developing a media and communications strategy to connect displaced residents to services and information.</p>
<p>The organization, with the motto of "Lifting Up What Works," collaborates with partners on topics as varied as equitable development and community strategies to improve health.</p>
<p>PolicyLink is the latest step in a long career of activism and community-building for Blackwell. A lawyer, she first drew attention as founder of the Oakland Urban Strategies Council, focusing on neighborhood revitalization. From 1977 to 1987, she was a partner at Public Advocates, a nationally known public interest law firm. Blackwell also served as senior vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, overseeing the foundation's domestic and cultural divisions, and developed the foundation's building democracy division, which focused on race and policy.</p>
<p>She is coauthor of the book Searching for the Uncommon Common Ground: New Dimensions on Race in America (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002). Blackwell's coauthors are Stewart Kwoh and Manuel Pastor, UCSC professor of Latin American and Latino studies, who will serve as emcee of the King convocation.</p>
<p>In addition to UCSC, the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation is sponsored by the City of Santa Cruz, the Santa Cruz Sentinel, KUSP Radio, The Nickelodeon and Del Mar Theaters, and the Santa Cruz Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f7e6a8072704601a012ff6a6de120"><name>819</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Journalist who broke CIA prison story speaks March 6 at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Contact: Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>priest prison CIA clandestine washington post alumni award</keywords><start-date>1140073200000</start-date><display-name>Journalist who broke CIA...</display-name><path>/2006/02/819</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/819</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338160186</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338160186</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dana Priest, the award-winning <i>Washington Post</i> reporter who broke the story about the CIA's secret overseas prisons, will give a free public lecture March 6 at UC Santa Cruz.

The visit was arranged by assistant theater arts professor Alma Martinez--who first met Quintana in Mexico on the set of the 1983 film Under Fire, in which Martinez appeared opposite Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, and Nick Nolte. </p><p>Born and raised in Chile, Quintana was sent to a convent at the age of 12 when her mother took a job in the United States. Two years later, her mother moved to New York and sent for her. "I arrived in New York in 1962 and spoke no English," recalled Quintana. "We were very poor and four of us lived in a one-bedroom apartment; my mother worked in a button factory and my stepfather worked for the Lionel Train company."</p><p>The family eventually moved to Los Angeles, and she studied cinema for less than a year at L.A. City College. But Quintana said she was able to break into the film business because she spoke Spanish. </p><p>"A lot of the major films at that time were being shot in Mexico, so I was very fortunate from the beginning," Quintana explained. "And I had to learn my job quickly because I was working with big people. But there was always someone on the set who had more experience-that's how you really learn the business."</p><p>"I never pictured myself working for people like Steven Spielberg," Quintana added. "I was in total shock when I received a call to do an interview for Hook."</p><p>At one of her discussions that took place in the UCSC Second Stage Theater, Quintana took questions from students about her job responsibilities and how to break into the business. She advised the aspiring filmmakers "to work on anything and everything you can: home movies, student films, independent films.and try to get a job as an extra-particularly on a big film-so you can watch and see how the directors, actors, and crews work and prepare."</p><p>Quintana said her biggest responsibility as a script supervisor was continuity with regard to hair, wardrobe, props, sets, time, and dialogue. </p><p>"You have to make sure that things match, that the film has the same look, the same rhythm, and that people appear the same," she explained. "For example, Almost Famous with Cameron Crowe was one of the hardest films I've done because there were so many different time periods that we shot in."</p><p>Quintana--who has worked with such accomplished actors as Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Glenn Close, and Kevin Spacey--said she still loves the fantasy of films-even after 30 years of behind-the-scenes work in the business.</p><p>"It's very addictive, I don't know what else I would do for a living," she observed. "I even put myself in all the films I work on. I was a maid in Almost Famous and Catch Me If You Can, an inspector in The Terminal, a bystander in War of the Worlds, and in Minority Report, I'm the computer voice that lets Tom Cruise in the building." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f81758072704601a012ff6eb0b9df"><name>821</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Authors of The View from the Center of the Universe will discuss our place in the cosmos in a free public lecture on Thursday, March 9</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1140505200000</start-date><display-name>Authors of The View...</display-name><path>/2006/02/821</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/821</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338160948</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338160948</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a free public lecture and multimedia presentation next month in Santa Cruz, cosmologist Joel Primack and his wife, Nancy Abrams, will offer a preview of the remarkable ideas in their forthcoming book, <i>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos</i> (Penguin/Riverhead, April 2006).</p><p>Primack, a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Abrams, a writer and scholar interested in the history and philosophy of science, will speak on Thursday, March 9, at 8 p.m. at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean Street, in Santa Cruz. The event is part of the Halliday Lecture Series presented by UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and UC Observatories/Lick Observatory.</p><p>For a decade, Primack and Abrams have been teaching a course at UCSC called <i>Cosmology and Culture,</i> from which their new book developed. In it, they argue that for the first time in human history a scientific theory of the universe as a whole is emerging--a theory that explains how the universe operates, what it's made of, where it came from, and how it is evolving. </p><p>Drawing from the latest discoveries and ideas in astrophysics and cosmology, Primack and Abrams show how humans are indeed central to the universe and what this might mean for our culture and our personal lives. The result is a science-based cosmology that allows people to understand the universe as a whole and their extraordinary place in it. </p><p>Primack is one of the world's leading cosmologists and an originator and developer of the theory of cold dark matter, now accepted as the standard theory of the structure and evolution of the universe. He and his team use some of the world's biggest supercomputers to simulate the evolution of the universe, and they compare the results with observational data. He has recently chaired the Forum on Physics and Society of the American Physical Society, as well as the Committee on Science, Ethics, and Religion of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is coauthor of <i>Advice and Dissent: Scientists in the Political Arena.</i></p><p>Abrams is a lawyer, writer, and former Fulbright scholar, with a long-term interest in the history, philosophy, and politics of science. While working on the staff of the U.S. Congress, she cocreated a novel method by which government agencies can make wise policy decisions in cases involving scientific uncertainty, and she has consulted on this for the Swedish government, several state governments, and various corporations. Her articles have appeared in journals, magazines, and books. She has also released three albums of her songs and performed in 18 countries.</p><p>Additional information about <i>The View from the Center of the Universe</i> is available on the web at <a href="http://viewfromthecenter.com/">http://viewfromthecenter.com/</a>.</p><p>The Halliday Lecture Series is made possible through the generous support of UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee John Halliday to promote public awareness of astronomy and astrophysics.

Eager for tools to help their children learn, they urged Massaro to market materials that use the facial animation software he'd developed for his academic research. </p><p>Massaro had a hunch his work could benefit children having difficulty learning language, whether due to sensory limitations, autism, learning disabilities, low socioeconomic status, or because they were learning English as a second language. His software had proved a powerful tutor during a research project with deaf and hearing-impaired children at a school in Portland, Oregon, and children at a Santa Cruz school for autistic children who used the technology had demonstrated vocabulary gains.</p><p>Massaro teamed up with an entrepreneur whose son is autistic, and Animated Speech Corporation (ASC) was born. So far, ASC has brought two products to market, the CD-ROMs Team Up with Timo: Vocabulary and Team Up with Timo: Stories. </p><p>Timo ("Tee-mo") is an animated tutor that helps children build their language skills. Timo introduces new words, gives children image and text cues that facilitate their learning, and gently urges students to try again when they make mistakes. Colorful graphics and engaging content--vocabulary lessons include segments on animals, geography, space, weather, people in history, and government--complete the package.</p><p>Children give the CD-ROMs high marks, according to speech-language pathologist Chris Soland, who works with about 36 children with severe to profound hearing loss at Tucker-Maxon Oral School in Portland. The children rave about Timo, she said. </p><p>"It's the first thing they ask when they come to work with me: 'Can I do Timo today?'" said Soland. "They love it. There's something very engaging about it, because it's interactive."</p><p>Children can practice their skills independently with the CD-ROMs, which make the CDs a great way to supplement classroom lessons, added Soland. "Most kids really enjoy adult attention, and this replicates that in a positive way," she said. "And it never gets tired! It's always available and ready to help them learn." </p><p>The results are impressive: Students at the Jackson Hearing Center in Palo Alto who used the tutoring software to boost their vocabulary had an average retention rate of 98 percent after 30 days, according to Massaro's research.</p><p>In studies with autistic children, Massaro found that children had an 85 percent retention rate of new words 30 days after they had learned them. Massaro says children like the immediate feedback they get while working with the program. </p><p>"It's the old-fashioned idea of time on task," added Massaro. "Children devote more time to it and get a better result."</p><p>Over the years, Massaro's research has been published in many of the top peer-reviewed journals in his field--the litmus test for academics. Reflecting on the "real-world" applications of what began as pure research, Massaro acknowledges a new and different sense of satisfaction.</p><p>"When I started in psychology, I never thought I'd do anything like this. I really stumbled into it," said Massaro. "It has been very rewarding. People tell us we've helped their kids, and that's great."</p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: Dominic Massaro may be reached at (831) 459-2330 or via e-mail at massaro@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f84438072704601a012ffa57bb2ae"><name>823</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Philanthropist Jack Baskin inducted into Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1140678000000</start-date><display-name>Philanthropist Jack Baskin inducted...</display-name><path>/2006/02/823</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/823</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338161685</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338161685</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jack Baskin, whose steadfast support led to the establishment and rapid growth of the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame at a ceremony on Friday, February 24.

McHenry Library. </p><p>The Hugh Stuart Center California History Room will be established with the aim of introducing a new generation of UCSC students and local community members to the diverse history of the central California coast. It will provide state-of-the-art facilities and services to expand and preserve the UCSC California history collection and make it broadly accessible to the campus and community.</p><p>"The library is very honored to be the recipient of this generous gift," said University Librarian Virginia Steel. "It will allow us to create an inspirational space in the renovated Special Collections department in which we will continue to make our unique resources accessible to researchers and scholars. We look forward to showcasing our distinctive collections of rare Californian and local history documents and cultural artifacts in this focused research and study room."</p><p>Since its founding in 1965, UCSC's Special Collections has assembled an extensive collection of regional historical materials that includes pre-statehood documents, oral history interviews, archives of the world-renowned Lick Observatory, the Morley Baer photographic collection of 20th-century California architecture, and the papers of key cultural, business, and political figures such as composer Lou Harrison, author James Houston, the Hihn-Younger and Porter-Sesnon families, and state senator Henry Mello.</p><p>The $100,000 gift will primarily be used to:</p><p>. Equip the new space with customized exhibit facilities to promote California history, and with specialized equipment--such as oversized shelving and audio-visual devices for innovative instruction and display.</p><p>. Acquire additional historical collections as they become available, investing in primary source material such as author archives and California fine-press publications that state funding does not cover.</p><p>.

Mary Lou Zoback, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, will speak on "The 1906 Earthquake: Lessons Learned, Lessons Forgotten, and Future Directions" on Wednesday, March 15, at 7 p.m. at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean St., in Santa Cruz.</p><p>Zoback's talk, sponsored by UCSC's Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE), is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and the Seismological Society of America. CSIDE director Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Keck Seismological Laboratory at UCSC, will introduce Zoback.</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, San Francisco was considered the "most cosmopolitan city outside of New York." But everything changed overnight when the city was violently shaken awake at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake. The earthquake and resulting firestorm over the next three days left more than 3,000 people dead. In San Francisco alone, 225,000 of the city's 400,000 citizens were left homeless, and significant damage occurred throughout northern California. The centennial of this major natural disaster affords an opportunity to commemorate the cultural and social response to this historic event and to highlight a century of progress in understanding earthquake hazards and reducing the risks they pose. </p><p>The 1906 earthquake on the northern San Andreas Fault prompted an unprecedented scientific investigation. For the first time, the effects and impacts of a major seismic event were systematically studied and documented in a detailed report published in 1908. As earthquake science evolves, reanalysis of the 1906 earthquake data continues to yield new insights about that event and the behavior of large strike-slip faults in general. </p><p>Zoback currently serves as the regional coordinator for the USGS Northern California Earthquake Hazard Program. She is a respected geophysicist recognized for her work on the relationship between earthquakes and the state of stress in the Earth's crust. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Zoback has served on numerous national committees and panels and as president of the Geological Society of America. In 1987, she was awarded the American Geophysical Union's Macelwane Award for "significant contributions to the geophysical sciences by a young scientist of outstanding ability." She earned her B.S. and Ph.D. in geophysics from Stanford University.</p><p>For more information about the lecture, contact Jennifer Fish at (831) 459-1235.</p><p>Information about UCSC's Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth is available on the web at <a href="http://cside.ucsc.edu">http://cside.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a277a7538072704601a012ff519de04b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626004784</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626004784</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a277a7538072704601a012ff519de04b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626004784</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626004784</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
