Blumenthal will recommend reducing UCSC's proposed potential enrollment to 19,500 when he presents the campus's 2005-2020 Long-Range Development Plan to the UC Regents later in September. Compared with the earlier suggested enrollment limit of 21,000 students, this represents a 25 percent reduction in the number of additional students the campus may enroll beyond the current limitation of 15,000.</p>

</table>
<p>The enrollment reduction is the result of the campus's decision to revise its originally proposed LRDP and to request the UC Regents to adopt the Environmentally Superior Alternative. This Alternative includes a reduction of nearly 900,000 gross square feet of potential new campus construction, and reduces prospective water use by 22 percent compared to the originally proposed 2005 - 2020 LRDP.</p>
<p>"My colleagues and I at UC Santa Cruz have listened attentively to the concerns of the Santa Cruz City Council and other members of our community, " Blumenthal said. "We are committed to achieving the goals of our academic plan by creating more world-class academic programs and by providing greater access to a UC education for future students. We will do that by balancing our academic aspirations with the needs of the community in which we live."</p>
<p>Blumenthal said he will urge the UC Regents to approve the reduction from 21,000 to 19,500 when the board considers UCSC's Final LRDP and Final Environmental Impact Report at its September 19-21 meeting. He also noted that the 19,500 figure represents an upper envelope to growth by 2020 rather than a commitment to grow to that number of students.</p>
<p>"We believe the revised plan with a reduced enrollment figure and other changes maintains UCSC's commitment to deliver an excellent, yet accessible, education to California's next generation of students," Blumenthal said. "We also believe this new lower number demonstrates our desire to be responsive to concerns about the impact of growth raised during the Long-Range Development Plan process."</p>
<p>The Long-Range Development Plan is a land-use plan that enables the university as well as the city and county to strategically prepare for the campus's development over a 15-year period. Thoughtful planning, done in conjunction with a carefully conceived academic blueprint, enables the campus to anticipate needs, build infrastructure, and assimilate the necessary resources in an orderly program of growth, the chancellor noted.</p>
<p>Within the University of California system, Long-Range Development Plans are prepared to support the academic goals of individual campuses. They also take into account projected statewide enrollment demand. Much like municipal General Plans, LRDP's define a building program and a land-use map that serve as a planning framework for possible future growth.</p>
<p>LRDPs are not implementation plans, noted campus architect Frank Zwart, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction. "The LRDP serves as a general blueprint for growth, when growth becomes necessary, " noted Zwart. "The adoption by the UC Regents of an LRDP is not a commitment to meeting the enrollment number, nor to specific projects, construction schedules, or funding priorities,"</p>
<p>The campus initiated its LRDP planning process in 2003. Academic planning was the primary motivation behind UCSC's updated LRDP. Consideration of academic goals informed the work of the campus's Strategic Futures Committee, a faculty-led group charged with identifying the range of academic and research programs that may emerge in UCSC's future. The committee had initially suggested that an enrollment of 25,000 at the end of the 15-year planning period would best respond to "state demographic demand and campus program aspirations." In its final report, issued in June 2004, the committee recommended the 21,000-student scenario, saying it represented a "commitment to a growth rate that is responsive, responsible, and strategic; is consistent with an emphasis on quality and with campus values-including the campus's desire to work with the Santa Cruz community to seek practical solutions to the inevitable challenges of change and growth."</p>
<p>The Final LRDP and Final EIR that will be presented to the Board of Regents will be posted online by late afternoon on Wednesday, September 6. The URL will be: <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu">lrdp.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Both documents also will be delivered on Wednesday afternoon to the downtown branch of the Santa Cruz Library and to UCSC's McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering libraries). In addition, a printout or a copy of a CD may be purchased from Santa Cruz Fed-Ex Kinko's on Laurel Street in downtown Santa Cruz or on campus at XpressIt!, located next to the Bay Tree Bookstore.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915037698072704601a012ffadba9591"><name>930</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers tackle problem of data storage for next-generation supercomputers</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>SSRC, petascale, supercomputers</keywords><start-date>1157612400000</start-date><display-name>Researchers tackle problem of...</display-name><path>/2006/09/930</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/09/930</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338207526</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338207526</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded a five-year, $11 million grant to researchers at three universities and five national laboratories to find new ways of managing the torrent of data that will be produced by the coming generation of supercomputers. The Petascale Data Storage Institute includes researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, and the DOE's Los Alamos, Sandia, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories. </p><p>The innovations developed by this new institute will enable U.S. scientists to fully exploit the power of computing systems that will be capable of performing millions of billions of calculations each second. Such computational power is necessary because scientists depend on computer modeling to simulate extremely complicated phenomena, such as the global climate system, earthquake motions, the design of fuel-efficient engines, nuclear fusion, and the global spread of disease. </p><p>Computer simulation of these processes yields scientific insights that conventional observation or experimentation are often unable to provide. This capability is critical to U.S. economic competitiveness, scientific leadership, and national security, the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee concluded last year.</p><p>But simply building computers with faster processing speeds--the new target threshold is a quadrillion (a million billion) calculations per second, or a "petaflop"--will not be sufficient to achieve those goals. Darrell Long, the Malavalli Professor of Storage Systems Research at UCSC, said the main challenges involve building reliable systems on a vast scale and handling huge amounts of data at high speeds. </p><p>"In these giant supercomputers, you've got many thousands of hard disks all working in parallel to provide as much data as possible to as many processors as possible. The file system feeds data to the processors, and if you want to increase speed by adding more processors, the file system has to be able to scale up too and feed the processors at a higher rate," said Long, who directs UCSC's Storage Systems Research Center.</p><p>Garth Gibson, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist who will lead the data-storage institute, said new methods will be needed to handle the huge amounts of data that computer simulations both use and produce. Petaflop computers will achieve their high speeds by adding hundreds of thousands to millions of processors, and they will also require many more hard disks to handle the data required for simulations, provide fault tolerance, and store the output of the experiments, Gibson said.</p><p>"With such a large number of components, it is a given that some component will be failing at all times," he said. </p><p>Today's supercomputers, which perform trillions of calculations each second, suffer failures once or twice a day, said Gary Grider of Los Alamos National Laboratory, a co-principal investigator. Once supercomputers are built out to the scale of multiple petaflops, he said, the failure rate could jump to once every few minutes. That means petascale data storage systems will require robust designs that can tolerate many failures, mask the effects of those failures, and continue to operate reliably.</p><p>"It's beyond daunting," Grider said of the challenge facing the new institute. Imagine failures every minute or two in your PC and you'll have an idea of how a high-performance computer might be crippled. For simulations of phenomena such as global weather or nuclear stockpile safety, he said, "We're talking about running for months and months and months to get meaningful results." </p><p>Collaborating members in the Petascale Data Storage Institute represent a breadth of experience and expertise in data storage. "We felt we needed to bring the best and brightest together to address these problems that we don't yet know how to solve," said Grider, leader of Los Alamos's High Performance Computing Systems Integration Group.</p><p>Carnegie Mellon and UC Santa Cruz are the two leading academic centers for storage systems research, while the University of Michigan is a leader in network file systems, and all three have sizable government and industrial collaborations. UCSC's Storage Systems Research Center is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of large-scale data-storage systems and software. It includes faculty from the Departments of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are both in the process of building petaflop supercomputers, while a third member, Sandia National Laboratories, has recently built a leadership class supercomputer. The remaining members, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, both provide supercomputing resources for a diverse array of scientists.</p><p>The data storage institute will focus its efforts in three areas: collecting field data about computer failure rates and application behaviors, disseminating knowledge through best practices and standards, and developing innovative system solutions for managing petascale data storage. The latter category could include so-called "self-star" systems that use computers to manage computers.</p><p>"The institute is bringing together the best people in the world to collaborate on these problems, and it provides a place where DOE can go to talk to the experts in this area," Long said.</p><p>The Petascale Data Storage Institute is part of DOE's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing program, which develops new tools and techniques for computational modeling and simulations. It is funded by a grant from the DOE Office of Science Programs.

"It aligns for the first time major dates in U.S. history with world historical processes."</p><p>The "Globalizing U.S. History" project is the result of the collaboration of more than a dozen UC Santa Cruz graduate students of world history over an 18-month period. It features a syllabus for each of the two parts of the U.S. history lower-division survey course, along with lecture titles and assigned readings. To encourage others to adopt this approach, there is also an instructor's syllabus that outlines each lecture, as well as a bibliography of essential readings to guide the instructor's preparation. The full curriculum will be posted on the UC Santa Cruz Center for World History web site (http://cwh.ucsc.edu/) in October. </p><p>Burke noted that the lower-division U.S. history survey course has changed little in the last half century, despite the addition of new research and new perspectives. He added that the new UC Santa Cruz model curriculum reflects the latest scholarship in world and U.S. history and might also be useful for teachers at the high school level. </p><p>"The UCSC model curriculum, as it is refined, should prove attractive to many colleges and secondary schools seeking to broaden the conceptual scope of their existing U.S. history survey by linking it to world history," said Burke.  "The course may also prove of interest to middle and high school history faculty in California who are seeking innovative ways of addressing the California framework for history by combining U.S. and world history."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91503a498072704601a012ffaf2ddb21"><name>932</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to present annual Maitra Lecture at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1157698800000</start-date><display-name>Nobel laureate Amartya Sen...</display-name><path>/2006/09/932</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/09/932</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338208281</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338208281</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Philosophy</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nobel Prize laureate Amartya Sen will deliver the sixth annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, October 7, at the Music Center Recital Hall. He will speak on the topic: "The Tyranny of Identity." The lecture will begin at 5:30 p.m., followed by a screening of renowned Indian director Satyajit Ray's film "The Home and The World" at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public. </p><p></p><p>After his lecture, Sen will be presented with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal-the highest honor awarded by the university. Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal noted that this tribute is granted to "individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose life and contributions to society illustrate the ideals and the vision of UC Santa Cruz."</p><p>Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998, Sen is also the recipient of the "Bharat Ratna," the highest honor awarded by the president of India. His Nobel citation stated that "by combining tools from economics and philosophy, he has restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic problems." Another Nobel laureate summed up Sen's many contributions by calling him the "Conscience of Economics." </p><p>Sen's research has covered a wide range of fields in economics, philosophy, and decision theory--including public health, welfare economics, moral and political philosophy, and the economics of peace and war. His numerous books have been translated into more than 30 languages and include Poverty and Famines (1981), On Ethics and Economics (1987), Inequality Reexamined (1992), Development as Freedom (1999), and Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny (2006).</p><p>The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture at UC Santa Cruz was established in 2001 by Foundation President Anuradha Luther Maitra to honor the memory of her late husband who was a distinguished scientist and visionary entrepreneur. A former student of Sen, Luther noted that "in a career marked by astonishing breadth, he has deepened our understanding of poverty, inequality, famine, and the status of women in development." </p><p>"In his many influential writings, he has approached economics as a human discipline that must reconcile individual choices in the marketplace with democracy and social justice," added Luther. </p><p>Sen is currently the Lamont University Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard. He has received honorary doctorates from major universities in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is a Fellow of the British Academy and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Sen's many awards include the Senator Giovanni Agnelli International Prize in Ethics; the Alan Shawn Feinstein World Hunger Award; the Edinburgh Medal; the Presidency of the Italian Republic Medal; the Eisenhower Medal; the Honorary Companion of Honour (U.K.); and the Brazilian Ordem do Merito Cientifico.</p><p>Sen has additionally served as president of the Indian Economic Association, the American Economic Association, and the International Economic Association. He was also formerly Honorary President of OXFAM and is now its Honorary Adviser.</p><p> Dilip Basu, director of UCSC's Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection, noted that Sen particularly selected the film "The Home and the World"-Sen's favorite Ray film--to accompany the lecture. </p><p>"Based on a famed Tagore novel, the film is arguably Ray's last great masterpiece," said Basu. "It was made in 1984. While finishing it, Ray suffered a massive heart attack which prevented him from making any major films before he passed on in 1992." </p><p>"Unlike his early signature films which have characters in shades of gray, "Home and the World" has an unadulterated hero and a villain," Basu added. "Both stand as metaphors around which Ray mobilizes his firm beliefs and convictions: humanism, justice, reason, women's agency, and rejection of politics mixed with religion."</p><p>This event is presented by the UC Santa Cruz Division of the Humanities and the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection.

The Computational Astrophysics Consortium includes researchers at five universities and three national laboratories and is led by Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>The consortium will use supercomputer simulations to study the most violent explosions in the universe--supernovae (the massive explosions of dying stars) and gamma-ray bursts (mysterious blasts of intense radiation). </p><p>By studying the evolution of massive stars and their explosion as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, the researchers will also gain new insights into how the "heavy" elements needed for life, such as oxygen and iron, are forged inside stars through the process of nucleosynthesis. When stars explode, the heavy elements created within them are ejected into space, eventually forming new stars and planets. </p><p>"The Computational Astrophysics Consortium will simulate these explosive phenomena and advance our understanding of not only the evolution of stars but also of nucleosynthesis and the mysterious 'dark energy' that makes up the majority of our universe," Woosley said. </p><p>In addition to UCSC, the partners in the consortium include UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, University of Arizona, and the Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National Laboratories.</p><p>The consortium is part of DOE's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program, which develops new tools and techniques for computational modeling and simulations. Woosley also led the consortium's predecessor, the Supernova Science Center, which was established by the first round of SciDAC grants in 2001. </p><p>The earlier project resulted in powerful new simulations of supernovae, which the researchers now want to extend to a larger scale, Woosley said. The new consortium will undertake the most complete numerical simulations of nucleosynthesis in stars and supernova explosions ever performed. </p><p>In addition to providing a better understanding of supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and nucleosynthesis, the consortium's efforts will yield theoretical databases that will allow more precise and reliable use of supernovae as "standard candles" for the determination of cosmological distances. In this way, Woosley said, the project will help scientists confront the greatest mystery in high-energy physics and astronomy today--the nature of the dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.</p><p>"Over the next five years, we will be addressing significant gaps in our understanding of these phenomena," Woosley said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Woosley at (831) 459-2976 or woosley@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91503d478072704601a012ffdb524811"><name>937</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC students mentor youth in new science/math after-school program</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>school, education, mentor</keywords><start-date>1158044400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC students mentor youth...</display-name><path>/2006/09/937</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/09/937</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338209030</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338209030</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Forty students at North Monterey County Middle School in Castroville will bask in the wisdom of their elders as UC Santa Cruz undergraduates serve as mentors in a new science, mathematics, and technology after-school program.</p>
<p>UCSC academic interns will team up with two teachers to bring science and math to life three afternoons a week, providing academic enrichment activities and giving many of the children their first glimpse of college life.</p>
<p>Many of the seventh- and eighth-grade students participating in the program will be the first in their family to go to college, noted principal David Burke. After-school activities that offer different modes of teaching can help reach students who otherwise might not succeed in the traditional classroom environment, he said. "Hands-on learning is the key to inspiring and motivating these students to higher levels of achievement," said Burke.</p>
<p>The middle school students will design and conduct scientific experiments, design a web site, produce video presentations, prepare public presentations about their projects, and practice their public speaking skills. They will also tour the UCSC campus, participate in science competitions and interact with staff of the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Administered by the UCSC Educational Partnership Center (EPC), the new program will run throughout the school year. It is being funded by a $50,000 grant from the NCCEP/AT&amp;T Foundation. The program will be featured at the school's Back to School Night on September 19 from 6 to 7 p.m., when the EPC will host a Family Math and Science Activities Fair. The school is located at 10301 Seymour Street in Castroville.</p>
<p>The after-school program bolsters the EPC's "Building Bridges to College" effort, an ongoing partnership with several schools in north Monterey County funded through the federal Gaining Early Awareness &amp; Readiness for Undergraduate Programs project (GEAR UP). It targets low-income, predominately Hispanic students in seventh and eighth grade, many of whom are English-language learners.</p>

Astronomers Rychard Bouwens and Garth Illingworth at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used the Hubble Space Telescope to explore the formation of galaxies during the first 900 million years after the Big Bang. They reported their latest findings in the September 14 issue of the journal <em>Nature.</em> <br/>
<br/>
<p>Deep observations in three dark patches of sky--the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields--gathered the faint light emitted 13 billion years ago by stars in primeval galaxies. Only the brightest galaxies could be detected at such great distances.</p>
<p>"These are the deepest infrared and optical data ever taken. We're looking at a very early stage in the buildup of galaxies," said Illingworth, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>The researchers observed hundreds of bright galaxies at around 900 million years after the Big Bang. But when they looked deeper, about 200 million years earlier in time, they only found one. Relaxing their search criteria a bit turned up a few more candidates, but clearly a lot of changes took place during those 200 million years, Illingworth said.</p>
<p>"The bigger, more luminous galaxies just were not in place at 700 million years after the Big Bang. Yet 200 million years later there were many more of them, so there must have been a lot of merging of smaller galaxies during that time," he said.</p>
<p>Astronomers can determine when light was emitted from a distant source by its redshift, a measure of how the expansion of the universe stretched the wavelengths of the light as it traveled through space across vast distances. Bouwens, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and first author of the <em>Nature</em> paper, developed software to systematically sift through the Hubble data in search of high-redshift galaxies.</p>
<p>The data came from two powerful instruments on Hubble, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrograph (NICMOS). The researchers compared the numbers of galaxies detected at a redshift of 7 to 8 (700 million years after the Big Bang) with what they might have expected to find if the population of galaxies then were like the population they had observed at redshift 6 (200 million years later). Depending on the strictness of their selection criteria, they found one galaxy where they would have expected 10, or four where they would have expected 17.</p>
<p>"Our approach provides a very quantitative way of measuring the buildup of structure in the universe, so we can see how fast it changed over time as smaller galaxies merged to form larger ones," Bouwens said.</p>
<p>The galaxies observed in this survey are much smaller than our own Milky Way and other giant galaxies seen today in the nearby universe. These early galaxies were also ablaze with star formation, emitting bluish light that was shifted to red light during its 13-billion-year journey to Hubble's sensitive detectors.</p>
<p>"It's quite amazing that we are able to look back across 13 billion years of time. We're looking at galaxies that have already evolved from smaller precursors, but it's only a few hundred million years after the formation of the first stars," Illingworth said.</p>
<p>If the Milky Way is a galactic senior citizen, then these galaxies are toddlers or preschoolers. For now, researchers are unable to detect the even smaller infant galaxies that must have merged to form these first bright galaxies.</p>
<p>But the seeds of those first galaxies can be seen in the the cosmic microwave background radiation, measured most recently and accurately by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which shows slight fluctuations of density in a remarkably homogeneous universe about 400,000 years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>"Very early in the evolution of the universe, everything was very smooth. But over time the universe became more and more clumpy as gravity pulled more matter into the denser areas," Bouwens said. "Our observations of early galaxies allow us to measure how fast the universe was evolving from smaller to larger clumps."</p>
<p>Detection of the very first galaxies to form will be possible with the successor to Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope, currently planned for launch in 2013, Illingworth said.

Accompanied by two kayaks and two support boats, the swimmers will take the plunge at the Santa Cruz Harbor and endure water temperatures in the 40s and 50s, the threat of sharks, and the "spooky" feeling of being far from shore before emerging nearly 12 hours later in Monterey.<br/>
<br/>
<p>It's a tough fundraiser, but UCSC swim coach Kim Musch said that's part of the idea.</p>
<p>"It's so hard and so miserable that you can't help but have an incredible bonding experience," said Musch. The Slugs hope to raise as much as $10,000 from private donors and local businesses, who underwrite the swim.</p>
<p>"It's way different from swimming in a pool or even swimming along the shore," said Musch. "Conditions can get a little rough sometimes, and when you get out in the middle of the bay, it gets a little spooky. You're a long way from shore, and it's weird to see a pod of whales or a giant sunfish, or a blue shark surface and come right at you."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said, the team has always completed the 26-mile relay. Swimmers typically take 20-minute shifts in the water, with kayakers paddling alongside. Support boats carry swimmers and paddlers. Swimmers even vie for a chance to participate, with spots going first to seniors, then juniors, noted Musch, who faces an endurance test of his own: "We hit the water at first light, and once they get to Monterey, the swimmers get to go home. I have to sail back, so I won't make it back to Santa Cruz until two or three in the morning!"</p>

The fall-quarter "move in" for students living on campus was scheduled to continue through Sunday, September 17.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, new academic programs the campus is offering, and new buildings that are under construction:</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment:</strong></p>
<p>UCSC's 2006-07 academic year enrollment is expected to average 14,767 over the fall, winter, and spring quarters. In addition, UCSC expects to enroll another 300 students in off-campus venues, such as the Education Abroad Program and the UC-DC program in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Of the 14,767 students expected to enroll on campus, 13,345 will be undergraduates; 1,422 are projected to enroll in graduate studies. During the course of the year, approximately 4,700 new undergraduate students (3,400 freshmen and 1,300 transfer students) are expected to enroll. The new undergraduates were admitted from among approximately 30,000 applicants to UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>Profile of New Freshmen:</strong></p>
<p>The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the many areas of the biological sciences, in business management economics, and in psychology.</p>
<p>Nearly 65 percent of the freshmen have declared a major. The other freshmen have expressed interest in a more general academic area of the following clusters: business and economics; education; environmental sciences; human psychology, culture, and society; information sciences, engineering, and technology; languages, literatures, and communication; liberal arts and area studies; life and health sciences; physical sciences and math; and visual and performing arts and media.</p>
<p>Of the freshmen expected, approximately 43 percent identified themselves as either African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, or Asian/Asian American; this is the largest percentage of underrepresented freshmen ever at UCSC. The average grade-point average (G.P.A.) of admitted freshmen is 3.69.</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of incoming freshmen come from the Bay Area/Northern California, while another 35 percent will be coming from Southern California.</p>
<p><strong>Profile of New Transfers:</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the freshmen, the most popular majors for transfer students who have already declared are in the many areas of the biological sciences and psychology, with the major in literature proving popular among transfers.</p>
<p>Of the transfers expected, approximately 31 percent identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, or Asian/Asian American. The G.P.A. of admitted transfers is 3.27.</p>
<p>Nearly 95 percent of incoming transfer students are coming from the California community colleges. Students from Cabrillo College are expected to total approximately 150, comprising more than 15 percent of all incoming transfers. Just over 28 percent of transfers will come from the Bay Area/Northern California; an equal percentage is expected from Southern California.</p>
<p><strong>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</strong></p>
<p>o Computer Engineering: New B.S. concentration in autonomous and embedded systems</p>
<p>o Computer Science: New B.S. program in computer game design</p>
<p>o Earth and Planetary Sciences: Departmental name change from Earth Sciences</p>
<p>o Feminist Studies: New B.A. concentrations in culture, power, and representation; law, politics, and social change; science, technology, and medicine; sexuality studies</p>
<p>o Literature: New B.A. concentrations in critical theory and in literature and film</p>
<p>o Music: New Ph.D. program in music emphasizing cross-cultural studies</p>
<p><strong>New Buildings/Other Infrastructure Projects:</strong></p>
<p>A number of construction projects are recently completed or will continue through part or all of the 2006-07 academic year. The projects include:</p>
<p>o Science Hill/Physical Sciences Building: Most construction work on the building has been completed, and the building's new occupants have begun moving in. The Physical Sciences Building will provide 132,000 assignable square feet of space for laboratories and classrooms in chemistry, environmental toxicology, and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>o Humanities and Social Sciences Facility: Completion of the three-building complex, located north of Cowell College at the northwest corner of Hagar and McLaughlin Drives, is expected later this fall. The Humanities and Social Sciences Facility will include a single-story 300-seat lecture hall; the six-story Humanities 1 Building, with classrooms, faculty, and TA offices, Division of Humanities and humanities department offices; and the four-story Humanities 2 Building, with Education Department classrooms and offices (the social sciences part of the project), other general assignment classrooms, and Humanities Division areas including language labs, and computer labs.</p>
<p>o McHenry Library Expansion: After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project took a giant step toward reality as construction began a year ago. The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will provide increased space to better serve library users. The project, scheduled for completion in 2009, will provide the campus with an outstanding, architecturally designed building in a setting of terraced reading gardens, redwoods, and cherry trees.</p>
<p>o Cook House retrofitting: The Cook House seismic retrofitting has begun and is scheduled for completion in spring 2007. The campus tour operation and Admissions Outreach have moved to Hahn 125. UCSC has designated parking spaces for reserved-tour visitors in the Hahn parking lot; spaces are marked with signage. The north and south parking lots at Cook House are closed for site accessibility improvements; the Barn Theater lot nearby remains open.</p>
<p>o Emergency Response Center: In order to consolidate campus emergency services, construction began a year ago on the Emergency Response Center, located in the south part of campus near the Carriage House and Women's Center. Construction is expected to be completed later this academic year.</p>

Alumni and parents played a key role, with nearly 2,000 contributing to the campus for the first time.</p><p>"Our donors' generosity fuels the innovation for which UC Santa Cruz is renowned, and I am deeply grateful for this support," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "This level of commitment underscores our campus's many productive partnerships and is a tribute to the achievements of our outstanding faculty, students, and staff."</p><p>The New Teacher Center, which collaborates with school districts in more than 30 states to improve retention and instruction for beginning teachers, drew considerable funding from foundations. Its largest-ever grant, $2.46 million from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, will make it possible to expand the center's work in the economically disadvantaged Ravenswood City School District in East Palo Alto. A $400,000 Joyce Foundation grant will focus on policy studies, and other New Teacher Center initiatives received support from the Wachovia Foundation, Goldman Sachs Foundation, and Rockefeller Foundation, among others.</p><p>Funding for outstanding marine research remained substantial. A $2.18 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation established a microbial genomics laboratory that will support a collaborative environment for UC Santa Cruz scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students as well as visiting scientists from around the world. Although relatively little is known about the ocean's microbial communities, researchers have found that they are enormously important to marine ecology, the availability and transformations of key nutrients, and even global climate. </p><p>The Moore Foundation also awarded nearly $634,000 for a marine research project focusing on 23 species of top predators in the North Pacific Ocean. In the Tagging Of Pacific Pelagics project, electronic sensors are attached to the animals so that data on their migrations and the environments in which they live can be transmitted to scientists. The foundation's generous support builds on earlier backing from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</p><p>Contributions to McHenry Library, the main campus library, increased as construction began on a major addition to the building. Once work is completed in 2007, a "reading garden," funded by a gift from William Ackerknecht, will surround the library. Inside, the expanded library will include a new California History Room at Special Collections, funded by the Hugh Stuart Center Charitable Trust. The library also received works, valued at $1.15 million, by acclaimed American photographer Brett Weston (1911-1993) from collector Christian Keesee and the Brett Weston Archive. </p><p>An unusual gift by the Silicon Valley Off-Road Robotics Association is designed to enhance research in the School of Engineering on obstacle avoidance and autonomous driving. The $850,000 Overbot is an off-road vehicle that has been extensively modified for driverless operations. Its special equipment includes sonar, radar, and a computer-controlled throttle, steering, and brakes. </p><p>A very human problem--the widespread H. pylori bacteria, which can lead to ulcers and cancer--is the target of a $720,000 research grant by the American Cancer Society. The organization is supporting UCSC researchers searching for H. pylori genes or genes important in helping H. pylori survive or cause disease. This research could lead to methods of blocking H. pylori's impact or eliminating it altogether. </p><p>A longtime interest in the environment led to a commitment of $350,000 for the Olga T. Griswold Chair in Environmental Studies, endowed by her son, Craig Griswold. The Griswold family spent summers in Aptos, near Santa Cruz, and Olga Griswold taught her children about marine life and the importance of protecting the environment. </p><p>In addition, $2.76 million was raised through Annual Giving programs, including more than $604,000 from alumni. Alumni also contributed $180,563 in reunion giving, and $86,777 was raised for the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund. Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation gave $473,456. UC Santa Cruz students themselves raised nearly $1 million by reaching out to alumni and parents through the student-run Telephone Outreach Program. Almost 2,000 people who had never before given to UC Santa Cruz responded this year to the program, in which donors direct their contributions to different campus needs.</p><p>"When you see the amazing and important projects these gifts support, you can't help but celebrate the selflessness and vision of the people and organizations that give so generously," said Donna Murphy, vice chancellor of University Relations at UC Santa Cruz. "Each gift makes the campus better and benefits the greater society by helping educate today's students and seeking solutions to issues and problems facing the world." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915049b98072704601a012ff096bf40c"><name>946</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book looks at Santa Cruz coast 'then and now'</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>coastal erosion, Griggs</keywords><start-date>1158649200000</start-date><display-name>New book looks at...</display-name><path>/2006/09/946</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/09/946</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338212227</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1506704753076</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2006/09/images/then-now-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2006/09/images/then-now-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>then-now-350.jpg</name><display-name>then-now-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>130491</file-size><width>350</width><height>496</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new book by Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, and local architect Deepika Shrestha Ross offers a unique look at the Santa Cruz coastline. The book juxtaposes historic photographs with photographs taken from the same locations today, showing how the coastline has evolved and changed, sometimes dramatically, over the past century.</p>
<p>The book, <i>Then and Now: Santa Cruz Coast</i> (Arcadia Publishing, 2006), offers a pictorial history of the Santa Cruz coast, featuring many local landmarks and notable landforms along the coast. The authors worked with historians and curators of various collections of historical photographs to gather old images of the coast. The book includes photos from private collections as well as from local museums and libraries.</p>
<p>The next step was to try to locate where the older photographs were taken from so that the authors could take current photographs from the same location.</p>
<p>"As much as possible we tried to reoccupy the site where the photographer had stood to take the earlier photograph. This was sometimes challenging, but it was also fun," Griggs said.</p>
<p>The striking images and accompanying text provide a fascinating perspective on the history of the Santa Cruz area. And the changes documented in the book provide clear evidence of ongoing erosion of the coastline and the hazards of coastal construction.</p>
<p>"If history tells us anything about the coast, it is that anything built on the shoreline should be seen as temporary," Griggs said.</p>
<p>Griggs has lived on the central California coast for 38 years. An expert on coastal geology and geologic hazards, he directs the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Coauthor Deepika Shrestha Ross is an architect who currently lives in Santa Cruz. Born in Katmandu, Nepal, she earned a degree in architecture from Cornell University and has worked in Washington, D.C., London, New York, and San Francisco.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91504b328072704601a012ff63b0cbdd"><name>947</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$20,000 scholarships help regional community college students transfer to UCSC</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>scholarships, LOA, pister, leadership, community college, region</keywords><start-date>1158735600000</start-date><display-name>$20,000 scholarships help regional...</display-name><path>/2006/09/947</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/09/947</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338212604</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338212604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Twelve hardworking community college students are enrolling at UC Santa Cruz this fall with $20,000 scholarships that accompany the coveted Karl S.

<p>Only 36 percent of Latino immigrant youth have a computer at home, compared with 77 percent of U.S.-born non-Latino youth, according to the new report, "Crossing the Divide: Immigrant Youth and Digital Disparity in California." The report is available online at http://www.cjtc.ucsc.edu/docs/digital.pdf.</p>
<p>Overall, 70 percent of native-born individuals had access to a computer at home in 2003, compared with 56 percent of those living in immigrant households, a wider gap than existed in 1997, when the figures were 43 percent and 33 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>"If we want immigrants to become full participants in the labor force and in society, it's imperative that we bridge this gap," said study author Rebecca London, an associate research professor with UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance and Community (CJTC).</p>
<p>The findings have serious policy implications for California and other states with high concentrations of immigrants, added London. Nationwide, nearly 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2005 was foreign-born and 23 percent of those aged 5 to 25 were immigrants or the children of immigrants.</p>
<p>"In California, more than half of the young people are immigrants or the children of immigrants," she said. "If they are unable to fully participate in the new information and communications systems, opportunities will pass them by and current disadvantages will be translated into long-term second-tier status."</p>
<p>The report, issued jointly this month by the CJTC and the Community Technology Foundation of California, also documented gaps between immigrants and nonimmigrants in rates of Internet access and high-speed Internet access. The authors identify strategies to help bridge the digital divide, including tax breaks, financial incentives, and support for community-based technology centers (CTCs), and highlight the value of such centers in expanding opportunities for youth to access computers outside of school and home.</p>
<p>Among other highlights:</p>
<p>. Within ethnic groups in California, immigrant Latinos have home computer rates that are 15 percentage points lower than native-born Latinos. Among Asians, the differences are much smaller; both immigrant and nonimmigrant Asians have higher rates of computer ownership, Internet access, and broadband access than native-born whites/others.</p>
<p>. Differences in education and income emerged as the two largest factors contributing to the disparity in rates of computer ownership, but the researchers also identified differences in the desire to own a computer as an important factor. "Immigrant adults tend to work in occupations that are less dependent on technology, and although their children may be clamoring for a computer, the adults may not make it a priority," said London.</p>
<p>Just as access to school, safe neighborhoods, and jobs were critical to the success of previous generations of immigrants, access to technology today is the key to full participation in the global economy, said London. "If we want to promote an equal shot at success, we need public policies that can bring all youth into the new digital age," she said.</p>
<p>The authors identify three strategies to help bridge the growing digital divide between immigrants and nonimmigrants:</p>
<p>. Expand Individual Development Account (IDA) programs to encourage computer purchases. Under current programs, savings by the poor are matched by public or private sources to encourage home ownership, postsecondary education, or business start-ups.</p>
<p>. Create tax deductions so working families could write off the cost of computers and Internet service for educational purposes.</p>
<p>. Expand programs that provide laptops to schoolchildren, and offer low-cost refurbished computers for school and student use, including at home.</p>
<p>"Crossing the Divide" was coauthored by London; Robert W. Fairlie, associate professor of economics at UCSC; Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies and codirector of the CJTC; and Rachel Rosner, a research associate with CJTC. The research and publication were made possible by grants from the Community Partnership Committee through its Applied Research Initiative on access to telecommunications services in California's underserved communities, with support from the Community Technology Foundation of California and the William T. Grant Foundation. The Community Partnership Committee was formed by eight coalitions of 134 community-based organizations and SBC (now AT&amp;T), to serve underserved communities throughout California after the SBC/Pacific Telesis merger in 1997.</p>

Business interests are more selective about exerting their influence than is commonly believed, and when they do get involved it's on issues that have high stakes for them and for the public, said author Sheldon Kamieniecki, a professor of politics and dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
<p>"We've underestimated the strict approach business has taken to environmental politics," said Kamieniecki. "It isn't fair to say they've been involved in everything and are single-handedly responsible for our lack of progress. They have limited resources and choose their fights accordingly."</p>
<p>The book is the first major investigation of business influence over environmental policy in all three branches of government. Through quantitative analysis, as well as six in-depth case studies of such hot-button topics as the management of old-growth forests, toxic dumping in the Hudson River, and the environmental impacts of coal mining, Kamieniecki examined the influence of business since 1970 on Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service, and the federal court of appeals.</p>
<p>"My expectation going in was that business was going to be ubiquitous, playing a role in everything having to do with the environment and natural resources," said Kamieniecki, who has studied environmental policy for 30 years. "That's what everyone has been telling us--environmentalists, my colleagues in academia, the media. But I found that not to be the case."</p>
<p>Business generally takes a hands-off approach to environmental and natural resource legislation, exerts little influence in the area of rule making-the work done within federal agencies to shape and implement laws passed by Congress, and wins about half the cases that make it to the federal appeals court, he said.</p>
<p>Rather, Kamieniecki's research suggests that business exerts its influence much earlier in the process, with at times devastating consequences for the environment. "Corporate interests define the issues and frame the debates to their advantage," he said. "When business does become involved, they are a formidable opponent for environmental groups."</p>
<p>For example, corporate players have stymied the public debate over climate change despite strong scientific evidence that human activity is generating greenhouse gases that are accelerating global warming, said Kamieniecki. He likens it to the early days of the debate over the health hazards of tobacco, which are now well-documented and well-understood by the public. "For years, the tobacco industry put forward doctors who said the scientific evidence was unclear, and we now know they knew that wasn't the case," he said.</p>
<p>The implications for environmental groups are straightforward, said Kamieniecki. "In my opinion, environmental groups have dropped the ball by not allying themselves with science. Far more often than not, science comes down on the side of the environment, and environmental leaders have done a poor job of framing the issues in scientific terms and communicating that to the public. It's their ace in the hole."</p>
<p>Despite environmental gains in air and water quality, and protection of endangered species and open space, Kamieniecki maintains that "progress has been slowed by corporate influence, and we've paid a high price-which will be much higher if we don't act decisively on long-term issues like climate change."</p>
<p>Kamieniecki identified three steps that would help speed government action:</p>
<p>. Environmental groups must become much more effective in how they lobby government</p>
<p>. The general public must become much more involved in environmental politics at the grassroots level</p>

<p>. Voter turnout and voter interaction with elected officials at all levels must increase</p>
<p>"When you have weak political parties and low voter turnout, interest groups fill the vacuum," he said. "More grassroots organizing will increase government responsiveness."</p>

Dunbar, whose expertise is in the area of feedback control, will be working with faculty in the Department of Biomolecular Engineering to develop nanopore technology for high-speed DNA sequencing. He will be applying feedback control to probe and enhance the ability of a nanopore device to obtain sequence information from individual DNA molecules. <br/>
<br/>
<p>UCSC's nanopore project, funded by a major grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is part of an NHGRI program to develop revolutionary genome sequencing technologies that will enable a human-sized genome to be sequenced for $1,000 or less (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=722">earlier story</a>).</p>
<p>"Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human genetic variations. This would in turn lead to disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome," Dunbar said.</p>
<p>NHGRI is sponsoring Dunbar's $690,000 grant, which will support him for five years of supervised study and research under the guidance of three faculty mentors. His primary mentor is David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, and co-mentors are David Deamer, research professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Mark Akeson, associate adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering. Deamer and Akeson have pioneered the development of nanopore technology for DNA analysis.</p>
<p>Dunbar's research will include the use of feedback control to probe and characterize enzymes coupled to the nanopore. The nanopore is large enough to thread single-stranded nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) through it, but enzymes are too large to pass through the pore. By pulling DNA and RNA molecules into the nanopore while they are being acted on by an enzyme, the nanopore serves as a "sensor" that can monitor the dynamic state of the enzyme, which remains on top of the nanopore as it processes the molecule, Dunbar said.</p>
<p>"Feedback voltage control can be used to hold the enzyme in place for monitoring purposes or to alter the enzyme's dynamic state," he said. "From an engineering perspective, enzymes are the nanomotors of the biological world, and they are amazingly robust and efficient. The possibility of being able to probe a single enzyme while it is functioning is very exciting."</p>

The interdisciplinary team of ecologists and social scientists put forward broad strategic guidelines for dealing with dramatically warmer temperatures in Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Alaska is way ahead of most of the world in the degree to which it's already experiencing the effects of global warming," said coauthor Erika Zavaleta, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"It's warmer and drier, winter ice melts earlier, and forests are under siege from longer, more severe wildfire seasons," she said. "We need broad policy strategies to deal with the changes, not just reactively but proactively."</p>
<p>In the paper, "Policy Strategies to Address Sustainability of Alaskan Boreal Forests in Response to a Directionally Changing Climate," the authors emphasize linkages between global-scale changes and local-scale dynamics, and they present a scientific rationale for a cohesive policy response based on four broad policy strategies:</p>
<p>. Adaptability--Given the unknown trajectories of climate change effects in coming decades, policies must emphasize adaptability and nimbleness; institutions that can adapt and innovate, from the community to agency level, will be of greatest value.</p>
<p>. Resilience-For key parts of Alaska's economy, ecology, and culture to persist in the face of all this change, social and ecological policies should maximize the involvement of local users in subsistence resource management decisions and should encourage diversity, both economic and ecological. For example, economic diversification away from overwhelming reliance on oil would help buffer the state's economy from abrupt or catastrophic changes, said Zavaleta.</p>
<p>. Reduce vulnerability--The psychological divide between Alaska and the rest of the United States must be bridged to encourage people in the "Lower 48" to change their behavior and slow global warming, while also working to protect Alaskans who are threatened by ice too thin to support snow machines, coastal erosion, and hard-to-read environmental hazards. "There's a disconnect between those whose behavior causes climate change and the people who are being most impacted by it," said Zavaleta.</p>
<p>. Transformation--Institutional barriers to major change must be overcome to facilitate transitions to new strategies, such as adoption of energy policies that could reduce rural Alaskan dependence on oil.</p>
<p>"We tried to address what this crisis will require at all levels, from the individual to the institutional," said Zavaleta, who has conducted research in Alaska for more than a decade. "The bottom line is that we need a broad approach that remains flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. But we need to get started. Climate change is happening, and in Alaska, people, infrastructure, and vast natural resources are already vulnerable."</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary team was made up of five ecologists, two anthropologists, a political scientist, an economist, and a historian, who call for the simultaneous pursuit of all four areas of strategic change.</p>
<p>In addition to Zavaleta and lead author F. Stuart Chapin III of the Institute of Arctic Biology (IAB) at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF), the authors include Amy L.

The crucial job of reading the genetic instructions and synthesizing the specified proteins is carried out by ribosomes, tiny protein factories humming away inside the cells of all living things.</p>
<p>Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been studying the ribosome for more than 30 years. His main goal is to understand how the ribosome works and how it evolved, but there are also practical reasons to pursue this research. Many of the most effective antibiotics work by targeting bacterial ribosomes, and findings by Noller and others have led to the development of novel antibiotics that hold promise for use against germs that have developed resistance to current drugs. Drug-resistant staph infections, for example, are a serious problem in hospitals.</p>
<p>Noller's laboratory achieved breakthroughs in 1999 and 2001, producing the first high-resolution images of the molecular structure of a complete ribosome. Now, his team has made another major advance with an even higher-resolution image that enables them to construct an atom-by-atom model of the ribosome.</p>
<p>The new picture shows details never seen before and suggests how certain parts of the ribosome move during protein synthesis. A paper describing the new findings will be published in the September 22 issue of the journal <em>Cell</em> and is currently available online.</p>
<p>"We can now explain a lot of the results from biochemical and genetic studies carried out over the past several decades," Noller said. "This structure gives us another frame in the movie that will eventually show us the whole process of the ribosome in action."</p>
<p>The ribosome is a complex molecular machine made up of proteins and RNA molecules. The bacterial ribosomes studied in Noller's lab (obtained from the bacterium <em>Thermus thermophilus)</em> are made up of three different RNA molecules and more than 50 different proteins.</p>
<p>Noller proposed in the early 1970s that the RNA component was responsible for carrying out the ribosome's key functions. At the time it was considered a "crackpot idea," but subsequent findings by Noller and others proved he was right.</p>
<p>"It was a completely heterodox view when we first proposed it, but it is now the accepted paradigm," said Noller, who directs the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at UCSC. "Our latest results confirm that the ribosomal RNA is really the key to ribosome function. The proteins are also involved, but more peripherally," he said.</p>
<p>To make a new protein, the genetic instructions are first copied from the DNA sequence of the gene into a messenger RNA molecule. The ribosome then reads the genetic code from the messenger RNA and translates it into the structure of a protein.</p>
<p>Proteins are linear molecules that fold into complex three-dimensional shapes to carry out their functions. They are made from amino acid building blocks, and the sequence of amino acids determines the protein's structure. Amino acids are carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA molecules. On the ribosome, the transfer RNAs recognize specific sequences of genetic code on the messenger RNA, and the amino acids are then joined together in the proper order.</p>
<p>The images from Noller's group not only show the complete ribosome, they show it with a messenger RNA and two full-length transfer RNAs bound to it. "We can now see the details of most of the interactions between the ribosome, the messenger RNA, and the transfer RNAs," Noller said.</p>
<p>The results provide a snapshot of the molecular machine in action. By comparing his images with those obtained by other groups that have caught the ribosome or its subunits in different positions, Noller is finding clues to the molecular motions with which the ribosome does its work.</p>
<p>"Our next goal is to trap the ribosome in other functional states to get more frames of the movie," he said.</p>
<p>The authors of the paper, in addition to Noller, are postdoctoral researcher Andrei Korostelev, senior scientist Sergei Trakhanov, and postdoctoral researcher Martin Laurberg. The researchers used a technique called x-ray crystallography, which involves growing crystals of purified ribosomes, shining a focused beam of x-rays through the crystals, and analyzing the resulting diffraction pattern. Trakhanov prepared the crystals and Korostelev and Laurberg performed the crystallography and solved the structure, Noller said.</p>
<p>This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Agouron Institute.</p>

<p>At that meeting, I will ask the Regents to approve my recommendation that the campus grow to no more than 19,500 students by the year 2020. Our current LRDP limits enrollment to 15,000, so the new number provides room for the campus to grow by up to 4,500 additional students by 2020 instead of the 6,000 students originally proposed last spring.</p>
<p>Even with this lower enrollment envelope, through careful planning and the judicious use of resources, I am convinced that UCSC will be able to meet our obligation to provide access and opportunity to future students. We also will be able to advance our academic aspirations, including expansion of graduate programs and graduate enrollments. Specifically, the possible growth of 4,500 students provides us with a realistic opportunity to achieve our campus goal of enrolling 15% of our overall student body as graduate students. When our LRDP envelope of growth is approved, we will have the opportunity to continue our campus discussions of the UCSC academic plan as well as how fast we want to expand our enrollments.</p>
<p>Last spring, the Academic Senate passed a resolution calling on the administration to delay submission of the LRDP until the Regents' meeting in November, unless the Senate Executive Committee endorsed a September submission. I strongly supported that resolution, and I am very gratified that the Senate Executive Committee (SEC) endorsed transmission of the plan and its accompanying Environmental Impact Report to the Regents for consideration at the September meeting. This agreement, which was reached in late August, is the result of close collaborations and information sharing between Senate leaders and campus administration, and I greatly appreciate the efforts of everyone involved.</p>
<p>The support of the SEC is critical, because delay in presenting our LRDP to the Regents would have cost us both money and lost opportunity. Delay also could have jeopardized important construction projects, such as the planned biomedical facility, funding for which is included in the education bond measure on the November ballot.</p>
<p>A news release announcing the availability of the final Long Range Development Plan is posted at <a href="929.xml">http://news.ucsc.edu/2006/09/929.html</a></p>
<p>The complete documents are posted at <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu/">http://lrdp.ucsc.edu</a>, a link accessible from the UCSC homepage.</p>
<p>As you read the documents, you will see that UC Santa Cruz acknowledges the very real effects of our potential growth on the surrounding community -- and they also describe UCSC's obligation and promise to mitigate those effects of growth. The challenges we face can only be addressed by collaboration with our community. I am committed to working personally with local government officials and others to advance our mutual goals. I underscored that perspective in an opinion piece published on September 10 in the Santa Cruz Sentinel. (<a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/September/10/edit/stories/02edit.htm">http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/September/10/edit/stories/02edit.htm</a>)</p>
<p>In the same edition, the Sentinel published an editorial titled, "As we see it: Santa Cruz's own failures," which commented on how the City of Santa Cruz might have provided needed services for the city. (<a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/September/10/edit/stories/01edit.htm">http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/September/10/edit/stories/01edit.htm</a>) I invite you to read both of these articles.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to thank all of the many faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community members who contributed to our Long Range Development Plan process. I will report after September 21, on the outcome of the Regents deliberations.</p>

(<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/09-25/lrdp.asp">See story</a>.)</p>
<p>This outcome is the culmination of both campus-wide and community-wide efforts that spanned almost four years. I want to acknowledge and thank all of the participants in this process, whose investment of time and energy has resulted in a framework for the future.</p>
<p>The Regents' action this week authorized UC Santa Cruz to add another 4,500 students to the campus by the year 2020. Now, we have to work on completing our academic plan and deciding how to implement it, including how and at what pace we will grow. These decisions will take place only after extensive discussion on campus, including consultation with the Academic Senate.</p>
<p>More specifically, the plan allows UCSC to offer access and opportunity to California's future undergraduate students, increase graduate enrollment, develop new academic programs, expand our research portfolio, and continue exploring the potential of new professional schools. In short, this plan allows us to continue the upward trajectory that has characterized UCSC over the past decade.</p>
<p>Let me add that I was heartened by the number of faculty, community members, alumni, business leaders, and other friends who addressed the Regents to urge support of the LRDP -- both at the Grounds and Buildings Committee meeting on Tuesday and at the meeting of the full Board of Regents on Thursday.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, at the Regents Meeting, several elected officials and other members of our campus and surrounding community voiced dissent. Despite their concerns about the LRDP and accompanying FEIR, Mayor Cynthia Mathews and other representatives of the City agreed that continuing discussion with UCSC representatives is essential.</p>
<p>Sharing in that spirit, I want to emphasize that I am personally committed to continuing discussions that will allow us to collaboratively address the community concerns that have been expressed. Besides the ongoing series of meetings between UCSC and City staff, I intend to continue to meet with community leaders seeking to find mutually acceptable solutions to the impacts of our growth.</p>
<p>A key task before us is to engage in the discussion of how UCSC will develop academically. Our new LRDP provides the campus with the means to choose our own future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Colleagues</audience><admin>George R.
