But Margaret Wilson, assistant professor of psychology at UCSC, found that short-term memory is equal when laboratory conditions are carefully matched for the two languages. </p><p>Her findings appear in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science in an article entitled "Comparing Sign Language and Speech Reveals a Universal Limit on Short-Term Memory Capacity," coauthored with Karen Emmorey, professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences at San Diego State University.</p><p>Previous studies compared common English words and ASL signs, without controlling for the amount of time it takes to articulate the different stimuli. A more recent study overcame that shortcoming by comparing signed letters to spoken numbers with equivalent articulation times, but it overlooked the fact that numbers have a unique superiority in short-term memory and are problematic in comparative laboratory experiments. </p><p>Wilson and Emmorey were careful to make sure subjects were exposed to precisely matched sets of ASL and spoken stimuli because many factors affect short-term memory, including duration, similarity, and familiarity. They compared recall of spoken letters to ASL letters that take the same amount of time to articulate. Controlling for those elements revealed no differences in short-term memory capacity between the two groups. "Our data show that short-term memory is in fact equal for English and ASL," she said. "The time it takes to articulate the to-be-remembered material is a universal constraint on short-term memory."</p><p>Wilson's findings are significant because they suggest that universal principles govern the way short-term memory works. "Short-term memory isn't a single dedicated mechanism, it's a principle, and it works the same whether it's the mouth or the hand that's moving," said Wilson.</p><p>Researchers studying short-term memory have long believed that spoken language is unique, but Wilson's work since the early 1990s has eroded that notion by replicating speech-based studies with ASL and demonstrating that the same principles hold. "There does not appear to be a dedicated mechanism for verbal speech," she said.</p><p>Wilson's latest work further debunks the notion that "speech is special" and opens the door to new approaches and different laboratory protocols. </p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: Wilson can be reached via e-mail at mlwilson@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91501d2a8072704601a012ff2277007e"><name>917</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC collaborating in interdisciplinary center to study marine microbes</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1154415600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC collaborating in interdisciplinary...</display-name><path>/2006/08/917</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/917</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338200827</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338200827</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is one of six partner institutions in a new interdisciplinary science and technology center that will focus on the microbial inhabitants of the sea. Funded by a five-year, $19 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Center for Microbial Oceanography Research and Education (C-MORE) is based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. </p><p>Jonathan Zehr, a professor of ocean sciences who will lead UCSC's participation in the center, is a senior investigator in the marine microbiology initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which is also providing support for C-MORE. </p><p>"The scope of the center is very broad and will allow a synthesis across disciplines that has not been possible before, from the molecular scale of genomes and genetics to the global scale of ocean modeling," Zehr said. "There is real excitement and commitment from people in all these disciplines to work together in this collaborative research."</p><p>The director of C-MORE is David Karl, professor of oceanography at UH Manoa, who is also a Moore Foundation investigator and has collaborated with Zehr for many years. </p><p>"We are on the verge of a revolution in our understanding of the sea around us, especially the role of microbes in global ecosystem processes," Karl said. "The primary mission of the center will be to increase understanding of the biology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of marine microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, single-celled plants, and viruses."</p><p>Zehr has done pioneering research on microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). His findings have broad implications in areas ranging from the ecology of the open ocean to the ocean's role in climate change.</p><p>C-MORE will bring together knowledgeable teams of individuals who otherwise have little opportunity to interact. In addition to researchers at UCSC and UH, the interdisciplinary team assembled for C-MORE includes scientists, engineers, and educators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), as well as the UH Manoa College of Education and the Hawaii Department of Education.</p><p>"A central objective of C-MORE will be to increase understanding about how biological diversity detected at the genome level expresses itself at the ecosystem function level, and then to transfer this knowledge to policy makers to assist them in their decision-making process," said C-MORE associate director for research Edward DeLong of MIT. "Marine microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye but their presence enables all multicellular life to exist, including human populations. Novel methods in molecular biology combined with satellite- and sea-based remote-sensing technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to study microorganisms across broad spatial scales ranging from genes to entire ocean basins."</p><p>As part of the collaborative research effort, the center will allow for exchanges of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers between laboratories. The center also has a strong education component, including support for undergraduate and graduate students, teacher-training programs, and outreach efforts to increase the diversity of students pursuing science and engineering degrees. The Agouron Institute has provided additional funding for C-MORE's education programs.</p><p>"Being a part of C-MORE will bring new resources and opportunities to students here at UCSC," Zehr said. </p><p>UCSC will receive about $1 million in annual funding from C-MORE to support its role in the program. In 2005, the Moore Foundation gave a $2.2 million grant to UCSC to establish a marine microbiology research facility, called MEGAMER (Microbial Environmental Genomics Applications: Modeling, Experimentation, and Remote sensing). The MEGAMER facility will play a key role in UCSC's participation in C-MORE, Zehr said.</p><p>The NSF Science and Technology Centers Integrative Partnerships program enables innovative research and education projects of national importance that require a center mode of support to achieve the research, education, and knowledge-transfer goals shared by the partners. STCs conduct world-class research in partnerships among academic institutions, national laboratories, industrial organizations, and other entities to create new and meaningful knowledge of significant benefit to society.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Zehr at (831) 459-4009 or zehrj@ucsc.edu.</p><p><b>Additional Media Contacts:</b></p><p>Kristen Bonilla, University of Hawaii, (808) 956-5039, cabralkr@hawaii.edu</p><p>Josh Chamot, National Science Foundation, (703) 292-7730, jchamot@nsf.gov</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91501ecd8072704601a012ff3a1b3902"><name>918</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>AIDS vaccine expert Phillip Berman to head UCSC Biomolecular Engineering Department</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1154588400000</start-date><display-name>AIDS vaccine expert Phillip...</display-name><path>/2006/08/918</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/918</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338201247</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338201247</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has recruited Phillip Berman, a pioneer in the development of recombinant vaccines for AIDS and other infectious diseases, to serve as professor and chair of the Department of Biomolecular Engineering. </p><p>Berman, who joined the faculty of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in July, has nearly 25 years of experience in the biotechnology industry. His current research interests include the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, as well as the development of new technology for commercial production of complex recombinent glycoproteins.</p><p>UCSC's Department of Biomolecular Engineering has created a unique interdisciplinary blend of engineering, computer science, biology, and chemistry. Berman brings to the program a new focus in infectious diseases, as well as valuable insights into the needs of the biotechnology industry, said Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>"I am most pleased to have Dr. Berman join our faculty to lead the Biomolecular Engineering Department at this critical juncture. With his deep knowledge of the biotechnology field and extensive experience in the industry, Dr. Berman will help realize the vision of the Baskin School of  Engineering in pioneering biomolecular engineering and bioengineering programs, in particular in building strong links to the biotechnology industry in the Bay Area and globally," Kang said. </p><p>Berman spent 15 years at Genentech, where he led research on recombinant proteins, vaccine development, and monoclonal antibodies. In 1995, he cofounded VaxGen, where he served as senior vice president for research and development. He oversaw VaxGen's efforts to develop an HIV vaccine and also began an anthrax vaccine program. </p><p>In 2004, Berman cofounded Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to combining knowledge and expertise from the biotechnology industry and the public health sector to address infectious disease problems in the developing world. </p><p>Berman earned his bachelor's degree in biology at UC Berkeley and his Ph.D. in biochemistry at Dartmouth Medical School. He held postdoctoral positions at the Salk Institute in La Jolla and at UCSF, where he worked with Genentech cofounder Herbert Boyer. He currently serves on the scientific advisory board of the AIDS Vaccine Integrated Project (AVIP), a joint effort of European and African research groups, and has also served as an adviser to World Health Organization programs on HIV and SARS.</p><p>"I will work to develop a first-rate biotechnology program at UCSC that takes advantage of the campus's proximity to the Bay Area biotech community," Berman said. </p><p>Jack Baskin, a UCSC Foundation trustee and longtime supporter of the engineering school, provided an endowment for the Biomolecular Engineering Department that has been especially helpful in recruiting new faculty members, Kang said.</p><p>"I share the excitement of many faculty members on our campus in working with Dr. Berman to build excellent research and education programs," he said. </p><p>For information about the Department of Biomolecular Engineering's academic programs, please contact the Baskin School of Engineering undergraduate advising office at advising@soe.ucsc.edu or graduate advising office at soegradadm@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915020218072704601a012ff756301ba"><name>919</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study documents the marathon migrations of sooty shearwaters</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1154934000000</start-date><display-name>Study documents the marathon...</display-name><path>/2006/08/919</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/919</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338201576</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338201576</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Every summer, millions of sooty shearwaters arrive off the coast of California, their huge flocks astonishing visitors who may have trouble grasping that the dark swirling clouds over the water consist of seabirds. Scientists have long known that sooty shearwaters breed in New Zealand and Chile and migrate to feeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere. But the details of this remarkable transequatorial migration are only now emerging from a study using electronic tracking tags to follow individual birds. </p><p>The flights of sooty shearwaters documented in this new study represent the longest animal migration routes ever recorded using electronic tracking technology: around 65,000 kilometers (39,000 miles). Taking advantage of prevailing winds along different parts of the migration route, the birds trace giant figure eights over the Pacific Basin.</p><p>"The only other bird species known that could rival the migrations of the sooty shearwater would be the arctic tern, which breeds in the Arctic and migrates to Antarctica. But we don't know if they do that in a single season, because nobody's ever tracked them," said Scott Shaffer, a research biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and first author of a paper describing the new findings, published in next week's online early edition of <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i>.</p><p>Shaffer worked with an international team of scientists from UCSC and other institutions in the United States, New Zealand, and France. The researchers found that the migratory cycle of sooty shearwaters encompasses the entire Pacific Basin, focusing on the richest feeding grounds in both hemispheres--from Antarctic waters in the south during the breeding season to bountiful coastal currents off California, Alaska, and Japan in the north. These small seabirds cross the equator twice a year in pursuit of an endless summer in which their feeding areas are always at or near the period of peak productivity. </p><p>Diving patterns recorded by the tags indicate the birds stop little if at all to feed as they pass through the equatorial regions on their journey between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.</p><p>"When they cross the equator, they're traveling fast and not stopping much to feed. They feed near Antarctica during the austral summer, then zip north to feed in one of three areas of the North Pacific, taking advantage of high productivity throughout the year," Shaffer said.</p><p>Sooty shearwaters are one of the most abundant bird species in the world, with a total population estimated at about 20 million. Nevertheless, they are potentially vulnerable to changes in their food supply, Shaffer said. Scientists have reported recent population declines at breeding colonies in New Zealand and in the eastern North Pacific. </p><p>The shearwaters feed on fish, squid, and shrimplike krill, which they take from the surface or pursue underwater. The electronic tags recorded birds diving to depths as great as 68 meters (225 feet) to capture their prey. Average dive depth was about 14 meters (46 feet).</p><p>The new study shows that, contrary to previous assumptions, sooty shearwaters do not make a big pan-Pacific sweep to cover all of their feeding areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Instead, individual birds went to just one of the three major hot spots and stayed there until it was time to return south to breed. But Shaffer said the birds that travel to different regions do not represent distinct populations of shearwaters.</p><p>"Birds that came to California stayed in California, and if they went to Japan they stayed there and then returned to New Zealand. But two birds from the same nest can end up going to opposite sides of the Pacific, and birds from different breeding colonies can end up in the same place," he said.</p><p>The timing and route of the northward migration was somewhat variable, with birds crossing the equator at various locations over a period of about a month. But the return trip was remarkably synchronous, Shaffer said. All of the tagged birds funneled through a narrow corridor and crossed the equator within a ten-day period in October. Ongoing research using tags redeployed on the same birds will show whether or not individual birds have preferred feeding areas that they travel to each year. </p><p>The research on sooty shearwaters is part of a Census of Marine Life project called Tagging Of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP), which is deploying electronic tags on 23 species of top predators in the North Pacific Ocean. Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC who oversees TOPP studies of marine mammals and seabirds, said the shearwater study was only possible because of the increasing miniaturization of electronic tags. </p><p>"When we first got together to plan the TOPP program, we didn't know if the technology was available to tag a bird that small," Costa said. "Sooty shearwaters were a species that we knew came here from the Southern Hemisphere, but we knew very little about its migratory patterns. Now we know this is an organism that integrates resources across the entire Pacific, which is quite a feat when you think about it."</p><p>The tag used on the sooty shearwaters, made by a Canadian company called Lotek Wireless, weighs about 12 grams (less than half an ounce). The researchers recaptured 20 tagged birds at two breeding colonies in New Zealand. The tags recorded the daily activities of each bird during part of the breeding season and throughout the migration to the Northern Hemisphere and back. In addition to geographic locations, the tags recorded pressure and temperature data, providing information about the birds' diving behavior and the temperatures they encountered at sea.</p><p>The temperature data helped Shaffer's team ensure the accuracy of the location data, using a technique that integrates temperature readings from the animals with those obtained by orbiting satellites. This method was developed in the lab of TOPP principal investigator Barbara Block of Stanford University and validated by Shaffer's team in studies of albatrosses. </p><p>Collaborators on the project also included seabird expert and TOPP investigator Henri Weimerskirch of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). He persuaded researchers in New Zealand who have been studying the shearwater breeding colonies to join forces with the TOPP researchers.</p><p>"One of the nice things about TOPP is that we have a consortium of some of the top scientists in the world, which makes it easy to make those kinds of connections," Costa said.</p><p>In addition to Shaffer, Costa, Block, and Weimerskirch, the coauthors on the PNAS paper include Yann Tremblay, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC; Darren Scott and Henrik Moller of the University of Otago, New Zealand; David Thompson and Paul Sagar of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand; Graeme Taylor of the Department of Conservation, New Zealand; and David Foley of the University of Hawaii. </p><p>Support for the sooty shearwater study was provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.</p><p>More information about the study, including multimedia content, will be available at the TOPP program's award-winning web site at <a href="http://www.toppcensus.org">http://www.toppcensus.org</a>.</p><p>_____</p><p><b>Notes to reporters:</b> You may contact Shaffer at (831) 459-1291 or shaffer@biology.ucsc.edu and Costa at (831) 459-2786 or costa@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images are available; contact Tim Stephens in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495 or stephens@ucsc.edu. </p><p>A preprint of the <i>PNAS</i> paper is available to reporters; contact the PNAS News Office at (202) 334-1310 or pnasnews@nas.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915025a98072704601a012ff009b73e5"><name>920</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC posts record growth in research funding in 2005-06</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1155020400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC posts record growth...</display-name><path>/2006/08/920</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/920</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338202998</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338202998</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, attracted a record $128.5 million in external grants and contracts to the campus in the 2005-06 fiscal year. The increase continues an upward trend in research funding at UCSC that has brought in almost half a billion dollars over the past five years. </p><p>"UCSC's grants and contracts awards grew at one of the fastest annual paces ever experienced by a UC campus--a 28 percent increase," said William Clark, director of UCSC's Office of Sponsored Projects. "Each of the campus's five divisions grew, and some units  more than doubled over the past year, including the Department of Computer Science and the New Teacher Center."</p><p>More than 79 percent of awards were from the federal government. The single largest award was $23 million from NASA for the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), located at NASA Ames Research Center. This also made NASA the largest funding source ($30.4 million), followed by the National Science Foundation ($25 million) and the National Institutes of Health ($20.8 million). The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation ($4.7 million) was the largest private source of research funding. </p><p>The top five campus units in terms of research funding were the UARC, the Institute of Marine Sciences ($15 million), UC Observatories/Lick Observatory ($13.4 million), the Department of Education ($9.6 million), and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry ($8.9 million).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915027108072704601a012ff8e405865"><name>922</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Woody Allen to headline UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures 2006-07 season</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1155625200000</start-date><display-name>Woody Allen to headline...</display-name><path>/2006/08/922</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/922</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338203364</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338203364</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value><value>Art</value><value>Music</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Renowned filmmaker and Dixieland jazz clarinetist Woody Allen, African world music star Angelique Kidjo, National Public Radio's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, and the European-influenced Aspen Santa Fe Ballet are just some of the highlights of the new 2006-07 UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures season.</p>
<p>The lineup will also feature a new work by the acclaimed Stephen Petronio modern dance company, set to original music by popular singer/songwriter Rufus Wainwright; plus Australia's award-winning Chunky Move company, performing a show titled "I Want to Dance Better at Parties"-an innovative, funny, and hip look at five ordinary men and their conflicted feelings about social dancing.</p>
<p>"Many of the artists on our new season I've been trying to bring here for years," noted Arts &amp; Lectures director Michelle Witt. "The idea is to bring to UC Santa Cruz work that you can't easily see anywhere else."</p>
<p>The season kicks off on October 27 with The Spirit of Fes 2006, Paths to Hope tour, featuring a mix of Moroccan Sufi, Spanish flamenco, South Indian classical, and Gregorian chanting vocalists and musicians. "It's a tour from the annual celebration of World Sacred Music that brings music of all the major religions under one roof to promote respect and peaceful coexistence among cultures," said Witt. "That's one of the reasons why we wanted to have it as our season's opening performance--what better way to address what's happening today than to experience the world's great cultural traditions."</p>
<p>On the theater front, Arts &amp; Lectures will present a new stylistic adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet from the Aquila Theatre Company's acclaimed British and American ensemble. Universes' fusion theater group will also present its latest work Live From the Edge, a blend of hip-hop theater, poetry, and gospel that has received rave reviews for the acclaimed company that has performed everywhere from L.A.'s Mark Taper Forum to Sing Sing Prison.</p>
<p>Classical music performances will include the Grammy-winning choral group Chanticleer; virtuoso cellist Lynn Harrell; and the Takacs Quartet, who according to Witt "perform one of the most intelligent interpretations of Beethoven on the planet."</p>
<p>Other season highlights include powerhouse vocalist Lura, mixing the music of Cape Verde with a bit of Latin rhythm and pop; and celebrated mandolinist Mike Marshall, returning to Arts &amp; Lectures for another duo mandolin extravaganza-this time teaming up with Rio de Janeiro's 30-year-old virtuoso Hamilton de Holanda.</p>
<p>"It's a very exciting season," Witt noted. "Every one of these world-class artists-whether musically, politically, or theatrically-reflects new developments and new ways of thinking in the performing arts."</p>

Although researchers have yet to determine the precise function of the gene, the evidence suggests that it may play a role in the development of the cerebral cortex and may even help explain the dramatic expansion of this part of the brain during human evolution.</p><p>"At this point, we can only speculate about this gene's role in the evolution of the human brain, but it's exciting to find a new gene involved in brain development, and it's especially exciting for us because it validates our approach of letting evolution guide us and tell us what are the important parts of the human genome," said David Haussler, director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator.</p><p>The study, published by Nature on August 16 as an advance online publication, was led by CBSE researchers Katherine Pollard and Sofie Salama, who worked with an international team of collaborators including neuroscientists in Belgium and France. Pollard, now an assistant professor of statistics at UC Davis, performed an extensive computational analysis, comparing the genomes of humans, chimpanzees, and other vertebrates to identify elements of the human genome that have undergone accelerated evolutionary changes.  </p><p>This computer-intensive bioinformatics approach produced a list of the most rapidly evolving regions of the human genome, and subsequent work focused on the top hit, a region called HAR1. Salama, a HHMI research biologist, led the "wet lab" investigations, using the laboratory techniques of molecular biology to characterize the gene, identify the tissues in which it is active, and begin the search to understand its function. </p><p>HAR1 is part of two overlapping genes. One of those genes, called HAR1F, is active in special nerve cells, called Cajal-Retzius neurons, that appear early in embryonic development and play a critical role in the formation of the layered structure of the human cerebral cortex. Cajal-Retzius neurons release a protein called reelin that guides the growth of neurons and the formation of connections among them. HAR1F is active at the same time as the reelin gene. </p><p>"We don't know what it does, and we don't know if it interacts with reelin. But the evidence is very suggestive that this gene is important in the development of the cerebral cortex, and that's exciting because the human cortex is three times as large as it was in our predecessors," Haussler said. "Something caused our brains to evolve to be much larger and have more functions than the brains of other mammals."</p><p>Pollard, as a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC, was part of the international team that performed the initial analysis of the chimpanzee genome. She and Haussler then devised a computational strategy for using the chimp genome and comparative genomics to identify regions of the human genome that had evolved rapidly.</p><p>"When we developed this computational method, we weren't sure what we would find. It was very rewarding to find that this region that came out at the top of our list is potentially relevant to human evolution in an interesting way," Pollard said. </p><p>Pollard's analysis showed that HAR1 is essentially the same in all mammals except humans. There were only two differences between the chicken and chimp genomes in HAR1's sequence of 118 bases (bases are subunits of DNA, the As, Cs, Ts, and Gs that spell out the genetic code). This similarity means the DNA sequence remained unchanged over hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history, an indication that it performs a biologically important function. But sometime after the human lineage diverged from its last common ancestor with chimpanzees 5 to 7 million years ago, HAR1 began to change rather dramatically.</p><p>"We found 18 differences between chimps and humans, which is an incredible amount of change to have happened in a few million years," Pollard said.</p><p>The researchers obtained preliminary evidence that HAR1F was active in the brain. Around that time, Pierre Vanderhaeghen, a neuroscientist at the University of Brussels, visited UCSC to give a seminar. Salama convinced him to include the new gene in a set of experiments he was planning, which would screen for active genes in a series of human embryonic brain sections.</p><p>"I had a half-hour meeting with him and gave him a DNA probe for HAR1 to take back to Belgium. I didn't hear anything for a few months, and then I got an e-mail from him saying that it gave a really interesting pattern of expression in the brain," Salama said.</p><p>HAR1F was first detected at seven and nine gestational weeks in the part of the embryonic brain that gives rise to the cerebral cortex. In subsequent experiments, collaborators in France looked at the corresponding gene in another primate, a macaque, and found a very similar pattern of expression in the developing macaque brain.</p><p>Unlike most known genes, HAR1F does not encode instructions for making a protein to carry out its function. Researchers are discovering a growing number of such "noncoding" genes, many of which produce functional RNA molecules. HAR1F appears to be a novel type of RNA gene, Salama said. </p><p>In the typical process by which genes are expressed or activated, the gene's DNA sequence is transcribed to produce a messenger RNA molecule, which then guides the synthesis of a specific protein. The encoded protein carries out the gene's function. Some genes, however, produce RNA molecules with special properties and biological effects. </p><p>A common feature of such functional RNAs is that they tend to adopt a stable structure that enables them to interact with proteins and other molecules. These RNA structures involve the same kind of base pairing that holds together a double-stranded helix of DNA. UCSC researchers were able to demonstrate a stable structure for HAR1 RNA from humans and other vertebrates. Furthermore, 10 of the 18 changes in the human HAR1 sequence involved compensatory changes that preserved the base pairing in this structure. </p><p>"The HAR1 RNAs from both humans and chimps form stable structures, but there are significant differences," Salama said. "Our hypothesis is that these changes preserve the overall function of the molecule, but somehow alter its interactions with its binding partners. Those differences may have something to do with what makes our brain different from a chimp's."</p><p>Ongoing investigations may lead to more definitive findings about the function of HAR1, she said. Haussler noted that this project was one of the first to make use of the wet lab he established to explore and verify predictions generated from his group's computational genomic research.</p><p>"It's been very rewarding to see it all come together like this," Haussler said.</p><p>In addition to Pollard, Salama, Haussler, and Vanderhaeghen, the coauthors of the Nature paper include Nelle Lambert, Marie-Alexandra Lambot, and Sandra Coppens of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (IRIBHM) at the University of Brussels; Jakob Pedersen, Sol Katzman, Bryan King, Courtney Onodera, Adam Siepel (now at Cornell University), and Andrew Kern of UCSC's CBSE; Colette Dehay of the Université Claude Bernard Lyon, France; and Haller Igel and Manuel Ares of UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA and Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. </p><p>Primary funding for this research was provided by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>#####</p><p>Notes to reporters: You may contact Haussler at (831) 459-2105 or haussler@soe.ucsc.edu, Salama at (831) 459-2814 or ssalama@soe.ucsc.edu, and Pollard at (530) 754-9380 or kspollard@ucdavis.edu. </p><p>For additional assistance, contact Branwyn Wagman, CBSE communications coordinator, at (831) 459-3077 or bwagman@soe.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91502a2c8072704601a012ffbc939a7c"><name>924</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's Regional History Project publishes oral histories of Loma Prieta earthquake and University Library </title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu </author><start-date>1156230000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC's Regional History Project...</display-name><path>/2006/08/924</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/924</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338204159</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338204159</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library's Regional History Project has just announced the publication of two new oral histories.</p>
<p>The first volume is The Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989: A UCSC Student Oral History Project. It consists of 11 interviews with Santa Cruz community residents, local schoolchildren in Aptos, UCSC students, plus the director of Watsonville's Salud Para la Gente, the nonprofit health care provider that served as one of the first-response emergency treatment centers after the Loma Prieta earthquake.</p>
<p>The series of interviews was conducted as part of a student internship class held at UCSC in 1990, "An Interdisciplinary Oral History of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake," taught by former Regional History Project director Randall Jarrell and cosponsored by UCSC's emeritus history professor John Dizikes and journalism lecturer Conn Hallinan. The volume is edited by Irene Reti, current director of the Regional History Project.</p>
<p>"These oral histories illuminate the diverse and subjective experiences of this natural disaster in ways that are not captured in news photos and articles, or geological and engineering reports," Reti noted.</p>
<p>Reti herself conducted 10 hours of interviews with former UCSC library head Allan Dyson, shortly before his retirement, for the second oral history volume: Allan J. Dyson: Managing the UCSC Library, 1979-2003. In this lively and detailed narrative, Dyson discusses the design and construction of the award-winning UCSC Science &amp; Engineering Library, the implementation of automated catalog systems, library fundraising, the impact of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, planning for the McHenry Library Addition, and many other key developments in the history of the University Library. The volume also provides a window into the general history of UCSC during that period.</p>
<p>"This oral history, conducted as part of the Regional History Project's University History Series, is a singular contribution to the documentation of 24 years of history--not only of UCSC's University Library, but also of a period of extensive technological and cultural transformations in academic librarianship in the United States," said Reti.</p>
<p>Photocopies of these publications can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or via e-mail to ihreti@ucsc.edu.

"Dr. Margon is a nationally respected scientist and administrator, and I am delighted to welcome him to our campus. His appointment underscores the importance of UCSC's research achievements in every one of our academic divisions. The quality and societal impact of research at UC Santa Cruz has continued a remarkable upward trajectory in recent years, and I am confident that Bruce Margon will build on our campus's strong research portfolio to help UCSC reach even higher levels," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal.<br/>
<br/>
<p>As vice chancellor of research, Margon will provide executive leadership and coordination for research administration and planning. UC Santa Cruz, which has made steady increases in research funding in recent years, received more than $128 million in contracts and grants for the 2005-06 fiscal year, a 28 percent increase over the previous year. Research funding has increased a total of 88 percent in the last five years.</p>
<p>Margon has extensive management experience, including serving on national advisory and policy boards. He served for many years on the Board of Directors of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), acting as chair from 1995 to 1998. He has worked closely with NASA and the National Science Foundation for the past 25 years, serving on and chairing numerous federal advisory committees.</p>
<p>In his current position as associate director for science at STScI, Margon oversees the equivalent of a university-level office of research for nearly 100 scientists and manages the external grants program. STScI, established in 1981, manages the scientific program of the Hubble Space Telescope and its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (currently under construction). It is one of the largest astronomical research institutions in the world.</p>
<p>Margon's own research focuses on high-energy astrophysics, particularly the late stages of stellar evolution and compact stars. He has been involved with the Hubble Space Telescope project for 25 years and has worked for more than a decade as the founding chair of the Board of Governors of the Astrophysical Research Consortium, a nonprofit consortium that builds and operates innovative ground-based telescopes, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Margon also oversees the STScI program in education and public outreach, the largest and most successful outreach program in astronomy.</p>
<p>Margon earned his B.A. in astrophysics from Columbia University and his M.A. and Ph.D. in astronomy from UC Berkeley. He has held faculty positions at UCLA and the University of Washington, and since 2002 he has held an appointment as adjunct professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. Author of more than 200 refereed publications, more than 100 papers delivered at scientific meetings, and dozens of other papers, Margon also has accepted a UCSC appointment as professor of astronomy and astrophysics. His annual salary as vice chancellor is $220,000.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91502da68072704601a012ff780f1a02"><name>926</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Extension launches new program in Knowledge Services and Enterprise Management</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Extension, Mantey, Silicon Valley Center</keywords><start-date>1156921200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Extension launches new...</display-name><path>/2006/08/926</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/08/926</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338205048</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338205048</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new graduate certificate program in Knowledge Services and Enterprise Management (KSEM) offered by UCSC Extension and the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz focuses on building the skills required to design and manage technology-based enterprises.

<p>Lead poisoning is a major factor limiting the success of efforts to rebuild populations of the endangered California condor. Since the mid-1980s, condors have been bred in captivity and released back into the wild in California, Arizona, and Baja California. The birds, which feed on carrion, can ingest lead from ammunition in animal carcasses or gut piles left behind by hunters.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers used a "fingerprinting" technique based on the unique isotope ratios found in different sources of lead. The technique enabled them to match the lead in blood samples from condors to the lead in ammunition. Their findings were published online today by the journal <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology.</em></p>
<p>"There had been anecdotal reports for years about condors being exposed to lead from ammunition, but there was never enough clear evidence to document the extent of the problem. We knew that we could probably identify the sources of the lead using isotopic signatures," said Donald Smith, professor and chair of environmental toxicology at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>The study was spearheaded by Smith's graduate student, Molly Church, who is now at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine and is first author of the paper. Church worked with researchers at several institutions and organizations, including the Ventana Wildlife Society and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to collect and analyze blood and tissue samples from California condors. She also analyzed ammunition obtained from a variety of sources throughout central California.</p>
<p>"We sampled the ammunition that these birds are most likely to encounter in the remains of hunted game, and we found that lead from those sources can account for the lead in the blood of 77 percent of the birds tested," said Church, who undertook the study after spending a summer monitoring condors as a volunteer with the Ventana Wildlife Society.</p>
<p>The researchers obtained blood samples from 18 free-flying condors in central California and 8 birds that had been raised in captivity and were still in holding pens waiting to be released. At the time of the study, this sample represented 43 percent of the wild condor population in all of California.</p>
<p>The lead levels in the blood of prerelease condors were low, and the lead was isotopically similar to background lead in the California environment. In the free-flying condors, however, blood lead levels were higher and the lead had a different isotopic composition that approached the composition of the lead in ammunition. In the most severely lead-poisoned birds, the blood lead matched exactly the composition of the lead in ammunition, Smith said.</p>
<p>"We found that in the birds with elevated blood lead, the lead isotope ratios fit a mixing model in which one source of lead is the background environment and the other source is ammunition. The results show that lead ammunition in animals shot and left in the field is the predominant source of lead exposure in condors," he said.</p>
<p>Kelly Sorenson, executive director of the Ventana Wildlife Society, said the study provides a solid basis for efforts to resolve the problem of lead exposure in condors. Possible solutions range from legislation limiting the use of lead ammunition to voluntary programs to encourage the use of alternative ammunition in areas where condors are known to scavenge for food, he said.</p>
<p>"There are different ways to get at this problem, but no matter how it is resolved in California, this research was desperately needed not only to confirm the source of the lead but to demonstrate the extent to which ammunition is contributing to the problem," Sorenson said.</p>
<p>In another part of the study, the researchers showed that feathers can be used to monitor lead exposure in condors. They analyzed lead in tissue samples and a feather from a condor that had died of lead poisoning in Arizona. They found that the feather, sampled sequentially along its length, provided a record of the bird's history of lead exposure.</p>
<p>"This shows that we can use feathers to look at the history of lead exposure in individual condors, and we're just starting to do that now with birds that have been reintroduced in California," Smith said.</p>
<p>The elevated lead levels in reintroduced condors are cause for concern even when they are below the level that would cause death from acute lead poisoning, he added. Although it is very difficult to evaluate sublethal effects of toxic substances in wild animals, he said, lead is well known to cause neurological problems in vertebrate animals at relatively low levels of exposure.</p>
<p>"The lead levels that we commonly see in condors are well above the levels considered a concern for human health. If we saw those levels in children, they'd be diagnosed as lead-poisoned and medically treated," Smith said.</p>
<p>Church said she hopes the findings prompt greater efforts not only to reduce lead exposure in condors but to reduce lead contamination in California in general.</p>
<p>"Lead is a well-known toxin that should no longer be getting into the environment, and it would truly be a shame if lead poisoning negated the significant condor conservation efforts and achievements that have taken place over the past several decades," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to Church, Smith, and Sorenson, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC toxicologist Roberto Gwiazda, Robert Risebrough of the Bodega Bay Institute, Page Chamberlain of Stanford University, Sean Farry and William Heinrich of the Peregrine Fund, and Bruce Rideout of the Zoological Society of San Diego. The study was funded by a grant from the UC Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program, an American Museum of Natural History Frank M. Chapman Research Award, the Bodega Bay Institute, and the Peregrine Fund.</p>

<br/>
<p>"The University of California believes that the City of Santa Cruz, in placing its UC-related measures on the November ballot, failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act by not identifying and discussing all of the environmental impacts of its actions. Instead, the City denied there would be any impacts whatsoever and, further, gave less than the legally required notice of its action to the University and to the general public.</p>
<p>"In recent months the University has demonstrated its commitment to working with the City by investing resources in productive collaboration for the mitigation of campus-generated impacts. However, the University believes that it is obliged to challenge the City-sponsored ballot measures.</p>
<p>"Not only is the City threatening to withhold contractually obligated water to a UC campus, the City placed the ballot measures on the ballot without a full disclosure to voters of the environmental impacts that could be created by the City's own measures."</p>
