The photographs are a gift from Oklahoma collector Christian Keesee, who acquired the Brett Weston Estate in 1996 and describes Weston as "one of the true American masters of photography."</p><p>The gift enhances the university's substantial holdings of contemporary photography and greatly expands its photographic collection of the Central Coast's dynastic Weston family. The University Library's Special Collections photo holdings were initiated at UC Santa Cruz in the late 1960s with the donation of more than 800 project prints by Edward Weston, Brett's father.</p><p>"These photographs are a cultural resource for Central California," noted Christine Bunting, head of Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz. "Christian Keesee's extraordinary and generous gift significantly enriches the research and viewing opportunities we offer to the campus community and the public that is interested in the development of contemporary American photography."</p><p>Bunting added that the donation makes the UC Santa Cruz library among the strongest repositories for Brett Weston materials. "Mr. Keesee has only made gifts previously to such select institutions as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Center for Creative Photography," she said.</p><p>While a teenager, Brett Weston began taking photographs at his father's side in Mexico, and he went on to forge a distinguished independent career that spanned seven decades. Weston's work has been exhibited and collected by major international museums, and he was a recipient of both Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts awards. He traveled extensively, but was always drawn back to the Carmel region where, in the 1950s, he returned to be with his ailing father and to print his father's most important negatives.</p><p>The gift to Special Collections includes Weston's gelatin silver print photographs dating from the 1940s to the 1980s, and the work represents a number of different aesthetic issues that the artist explored. Early documentary work, views of New York City, Mexican architecture, naturalistic depictions of California's Monterey Peninsula coast, abstractions based on the natural world, and the late Hawaiian botanicals are all included, along with a very special collection of portraits of Edward Weston taken in the 1930s and 1940s.</p><p>For more information, contact Christine Bunting at UC Santa Cruz's Special Collections: (831) 459-2547, specoll@library.ucsc.edu</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ff79f8072704601a012ffdd514916"><name>887</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz honored for providing transportation alternatives</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>transportation</keywords><start-date>1149490800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz honored...</display-name><path>/2006/06/887</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/887</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338191216</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338191216</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC's popular bike shuttle program has received a sustainable transportation award and the campus has made a national listing of "Best Workplaces for Commuters."</p><p>The bike shuttle ferries up to 14 bikes at a time up Bay Street and onto campus. Last fall, average daily ridership in the program was 153.4 passengers--the highest ever recorded. </p><p>"The program began in spring 2000 and quickly became one of our most successful, popular--even beloved--programs," said Transportation and Parking Services director Wes Scott. </p><p>The bike shuttle award will be presented at the "Thinking Outside the Bus" session at the University of California/California State University Sustainable Campus Conference June 25-28 at UC Santa Barbara. </p><p>TAPS operates the bicycle trailer and shuttle from Olive Street, next to the Mission Street Longs Drug Store, on weekday mornings. Cyclists load their bicycles on the trailer and catch a ride on the shuttle van up to campus. </p><p>"A survey of bike shuttle users conducted during winter 2001 revealed that approximately 40 percent were faculty or staff, one-quarter of whom previously commuted alone in their cars, suggesting a reduction of at least 15 vehicles driving to and parking at campus each day," Scott said.</p><p>"If this trend has continued as ridership has grown, current reduction in single-occupant vehicles should exceed 20 vehicles per day," he said, adding that about half indicated that Santa Cruz Metro was previously their primary commute mode. "Their use of the bike shuttle released seats on the crowded Metro buses, particularly during peak morning travel times, thereby accommodating other transit-dependent UCSC commuters."</p><p>The award is the second for the bike shuttle. In 2001, the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission honored TAPS for developing the program.</p><p>Nationally, the campus has been listed in the new Colleges and Universities category of "Best Workplaces for Commuters," a program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation. UCSC is one of 72 campuses honored. The program recognizes employers offering outstanding commuter benefits such as low-cost bus passes, strong telework programs, carpooling matching, and vanpool subsidies. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ff9088072704601a012ff6fdd52c8"><name>888</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study shows earthquake shaking triggers aftershocks</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1149663600000</start-date><display-name>Study shows earthquake shaking...</display-name><path>/2006/06/888</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/888</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338191557</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338191557</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new analysis of earthquake data indicates that aftershocks are triggered by the shaking associated with the mainshock, rather than by the added stress on nearby faults resulting from rearrangement of the Earth's crust.</p><p>The triggering of aftershocks by shaking may seem obvious, but is in fact a surprising result, said Emily Brodsky, assistant professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"The problem is that it's not clear how shaking can trigger an aftershock that doesn't happen right away, but happens a day or two after the earthquake. That's why most seismologists have thought that aftershocks are triggered by static stress resulting from the movement of the crust," Brodsky said.</p><p>Brodsky is coauthor of a paper describing the new findings in the June 8 issue of <i>Nature.</i> The first author of the paper is Karen Felzer, who began work on the study as a postdoctoral researcher with Brodsky at UCLA and is now with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. </p><p>Felzer and Brodsky looked at the distribution of aftershocks in relation to their distance from the site of the mainshock. They observed a smooth, consistent trend, with the number of aftershocks falling off steeply with increasing distance from the mainshock over a range from 0.2 to 50 kilometers (0.12 to 30 miles). </p><p>The smooth trend suggests that the same triggering process is operating over the entire distance range. But static stress is negligible at the far end of the range, so the dynamic stress from shaking must be the trigger, Felzer said. </p><p>"No one expected small earthquakes to trigger aftershocks at these distances," she said. "The traditional idea is that the aftershock zone is one to two times the length of the fault rupture, so for earthquakes of this size you wouldn't expect to see aftershocks beyond more than one kilometer. We're seeing aftershocks all the way out to 50 kilometers."</p><p>Furthermore, the aftershocks fall off in the same relation to distance as is seen in the decay of seismic waves. In other words, the number of aftershocks and the amount of shaking show the same mathematical relation to distance from the mainshock (an "inverse power law" relation).</p><p>"That's the kicker. The aftershocks fall off with distance in the same way that seismic waves do," Brodsky said. "We propose that the chance of having an aftershock depends directly on the amplitude of the shaking."</p><p>This hypothesis is consistent not only with the researchers' measurements of how aftershock density varies with distance, but also with previous measurements of the number of aftershocks triggered by a mainshock of a particular magnitude, Brodsky said.</p><p>The data analyzed in this study were obtained from a large catalog of southern California earthquakes with precise earthquake locations, published in 2005. This research was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Brodsky at (831) 459-1854 or brodsky@pmc.ucsc.edu and Felzer at (626) 583-7822 (office phone), (310) 569-4688 (cell phone), or kfelzer@usgs.gov.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ffa7f8072704601a012ff74aea7cd"><name>889</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Academic Senate announces 2005-06 Excellence in Teaching Awards</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>teaching awards</keywords><start-date>1149663600000</start-date><display-name>Academic Senate announces 2005-06...</display-name><path>/2006/06/889</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/889</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338191924</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338191924</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Arts</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Language Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Seven faculty members and 10 teaching assistants have been honored with 2005-06 Excellence in Teaching Awards for their exemplary and inspiring teaching.</p><p>Selected by the UCSC Academic Senate Committee on Teaching and the Graduate Council, the winners of the 2005-06 Excellence in Teaching Awards awards were recognized by Chancellor Denice D.

Denton said at the May 31 ceremony in the Academic Resources Center Courtyard.  "Students gain valuable life experience to complement their academics. Volunteering helps students become more aware of social issues and to grow in their personal lives." </p><p>The annual ceremony is sponsored by the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/svc/">Student Volunteer Connection,</a> which matches nonprofit organizations needing help with student volunteers. </p><p>Winning the top honor, the Platinum Slug Award, was Ashley Seilhan, who has contributed thousands of hours to be a student director and coach for the UCSC Special Olympics team. In 2004, Ashley helped create Disability Awareness Day on campus, matching Special Olympics athletes and UCSC students for a day of sports, learning, and fun. "Ashley's generous spirit and selflessness have been a gift to the Special Olympics athletes and our organization," said Liz Grumet of the Special Olympics of Northern California.</p><p>Patrice Douglass, runner up for the top award, has been involved with the Inside Out Writing Project through the UCSC Women's Center for almost three years. The project helps women in prison.</p><p>Gold Slug Award winner Marcelo Vaz volunteers at Barrios Unidos, tutoring students in basic botany and gardening and promoting communication within families</p><p>Veronica Hargens, who is dedicated to the protection of the California marine life and has researched bike-friendly cities, received the Silver Slug Award. </p><p>Student Organization Award winner Praxis is the service-learning program at College Nine and College Ten. Praxis volunteers have helped with the Second Harvest Food Bank, Homeless Garden Project, Louden Nelson Community Center, La Familia Center, Saint Francis Soup Kitchen, and Habitat for Humanity.</p><p>Alpha Epsilon Pi received the Greek Organization Award. Members of the fraternity have helped Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, CitySERVE, and the Brown Bag Food Drive. </p><p>Winning the Faculty/Staff Award was Tom Turrentine, who runs Merrill College's Classroom Connection. The project brings more than 150 UCSC students each quarter to three Santa Cruz schools to work as teacher's aides. "The Classroom Connection has served an important role in our community, connecting students with classrooms," said Abbey Asher, service-learning coordinator at College Nine and College Ten.</p><p>The Harvest Hero Award is awarded to the college with the highest percentage of student participation in the UCSC holiday food drive. Students contribute to the drive by donating meals and flexidollars from their dining plan to benefit the Food Bank. This year the Harvest Hero award went to Merrill College.</p><p>The five recipients of Community Service Project Grants--Nathan Berner, Jenny Lowthrop, Deidre Kelly, Irma Magallanes, and Anita Graffius--were also honored. These students designed and implemented a service project in the Santa Cruz community with a grant of up to $1,000 each. </p><p>###</p><p>Note: A related feature article about student volunteers is posted <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/06-05/volunteers.asp">online</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ffe1e8072704601a012ff5deb05b1"><name>891</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Long Marine Lab's annual Whale of an Auction set for Friday, June 23</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1149663600000</start-date><display-name>Long Marine Lab's annual...</display-name><path>/2006/06/891</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/891</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338192880</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338192880</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold the 21st annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 23.

The Centennial Medal, first awarded in 1989 on the 100th anniversary of the GSAS, honors alumni for contributions to society that have emerged from their graduate education at Harvard. Faber is one of four Harvard alumni who received the medal this year at a ceremony on Wednesday, June 7. </p><p>Faber attended Swarthmore College as an undergraduate, earning a B.A. in physics, and earned her Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard in 1972. She did much of her dissertation research at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Faber has conducted pioneering research on the formation and evolution of galaxies and the evolution of structure in the universe. Important concepts in cosmology such as "cold dark matter" and the "Great Attractor" are direct results of work by Faber and her colleagues. </p><p>She is also a leading authority on telescopes and astronomical instrumentation. Faber has been closely involved with both the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. She led the design and construction of a powerful spectrograph for the Keck II Telescope called DEIMOS, which she and her collaborators are now using to conduct a large-scale survey of distant galaxies. </p><p>Faber's many honors include Harvard University's Bok Prize, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, and election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. She joined the faculty of UC Santa Cruz and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory in 1972. In 1995, she was appointed University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915001088072704601a012ff85a3a1c1"><name>893</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz summer session has special option for those over 55</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Summer session</keywords><start-date>1150873200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz summer...</display-name><path>/2006/06/893</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/893</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338193617</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338193617</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Summer classes at UC Santa Cruz are open to all, but those 55 and older have an especially sweet deal.</p><p>For just $25, these nontraditional students may purchase a Summer Senior Audit Card allowing them to sit in on summer session courses as often as they wish, pending approval by the instructor. </p><p>Even better, these students may participate in class discussions, ask questions, and participate in other course activities, but do not submit papers or take exams.

"The summer auditors can come and go as they please," she said, noting that many check the syllabus to see which lectures look the most interesting.</p><p>Psychology, literature, legal studies, and sociology courses are especially popular with the senior auditors, Vani said. Courses not generally open to auditors are science labs, foreign languages, art courses, and most courses with an enrollment limit, noted in the course catalog. Vani said about 30 people each summer take part in the auditing program.</p><p>Those wishing to become Summer Senior Auditors may apply online at <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/registration.html">http://summer.ucsc.edu/registration.html</a> or print out the online application form at <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/seniorauditapp.html">http://summer.ucsc.edu/seniorauditapp.html</a> and send it with proof of age and $25 in check or money order (payable to UC Regents) or a credit card number to UCSC Summer Session, 140 Hahn Student Services Building, Santa Cruz, CA 95064. The Summer Senior Audit Card will be mailed back along with the Summer Session 2006 Catalog and additional instructions. </p><p>Summer session enrollment for all ages at UC Santa Cruz is expected to be about 3,500 this summer, with more than 200 courses offered. "Enrollment usually goes up about 10 percent each year," Vani said.</p><p>New this year is an art class in printmaking, an improvisational theater class, and an online course on Shakespeare called "Hamlet Conundrums." The most popular summer course, though, is organic chemistry, which filled up in three days. "That's the class that students need," said Vani.</p><p>Summer students have several options, with the first summer session running from June 26 to July 28. The second session runs July 31 to September 1, and there is also an intensive eight-week Spanish class, a seven-week course, 10-week courses, and independent field courses for undergraduates. Registration for sessions beginning in June is due by June 23. Late registration-with a $50 late fee-ends June 30.

Denton was a tireless champion of diversity and excellence, proud to be part of the University of California and eager to help it become an even stronger institution by reaching out to women and minorities. </p><p>"The University of California leads the United States and the world in public higher education," Denton told the UCSC audience that greeted her in December 2004, the day after her appointment as chancellor was announced. </p><p>Denton, 46, died yesterday in San Francisco; authorities have ruled her death an apparent suicide. In a message to the campus community, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger hailed Denton as a highly accomplished person "who dedicated her life and career to opening doors for countless young people, particularly for women and minorities who wanted to pursue careers in engineering and science." </p><p>"She led this campus with clear statements of the importance of education in transforming lives and in creating opportunities for all," said Kliger. "She, herself, had lived that experience, rising from modest means to achieve with distinction at every stage in her life." </p><p>Denton was a vocal advocate of inclusion who hoped to make the university more representative of its multicultural home state. </p><p>A champion of "excellence through diversity," she believed the best possible results are achieved by engaging the talents of diverse groups of people. She forsook the trappings of a formal inauguration for a two-day symposium that focused on diversity and excellence. "UC Santa Cruz does things differently but for a purpose," she said at the time, referring to the young campus's reputation for innovation. </p><p>Last month, Denton won the 2006 Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award in recognition of her work advancing opportunities in science for women and girls, and in 2004, she was among nine scholars honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. </p><p>In receiving the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award, Denton was singled out by one juror for using "the power of her leadership position to raise the visibility of issues related to supporting and advancing women and girls in science-related careers both on and off the campus." Another juror cited Denton's creative strategies to build mentoring networks. "Where they are few in number on a campus, women scientists have followed Denton's cues to find and support each other," she said. </p><p>Denton's willingness to speak out for causes she believed in was evident when she publicly refuted remarks about innate differences between women and men made by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers during an academic conference Denton attended. Calling the ensuing uproar a "teachable moment," Denton spoke of the necessity to "speak truth to power." </p><p>Denton's commitment to increasing the presence of women and minorities in science and engineering was unparalleled. She often described her own experiences as a woman in a male-dominated field to underscore the need for greater outreach. She was an inspiration to many women in academia, from undergraduates to professors, who recognized her accounts of isolation and occasional hostility. </p><p>As news of Denton's death spread, colleagues expressed sympathy and admiration. UC President Robert Dynes, who called Denton "a trailblazer in pursuit of equity and multiculturalism" during her investiture ceremony, recalled her as "an accomplished and passionate scholar whose life and work demonstrated a deep commitment to public service and to improving opportunity for the disadvantaged and underrepresented." During her short tenure at UCSC, Denton "emerged as an important voice in national higher education issues," he said. </p><p>Denton was "deeply committed to higher education and absolutely passionate about the importance of having an inclusive university community," said UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert J.

Denton, a trailblazing engineer who broke through numerous barriers in her academic career to become chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, died June 24 in San Francisco.</p><p>Denton took the helm at UC Santa Cruz in February 2005 after serving nine years as the dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, the first woman to hold the post at a top research institution. It was one of many "firsts" Denton acquired throughout her career, and she became a powerful role model and mentor for women and minorities in science and higher education.</p><p>An accomplished electrical engineer who held three patents, Denton earned a Ph.D. and three other engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One of four children raised by a single mother in Texas, Denton discovered her passion for science and math during a high school summer program. That life-transforming experience fueled her passion for outreach programs and her commitment to making similar opportunities available to others. As her accomplishments catapulted her to the center stage of higher education nationally, she became an outspoken advocate for diversity in academia.</p><p>"Denice was an accomplished and passionate scholar whose life and work demonstrated a deep commitment to public service and to improving opportunity for the disadvantaged and underrepresented," said UC President Robert C. Dynes. "She was a person of enthusiasm, of big ideas, of tremendous energy, and of great promise. In a relatively short time at UC Santa Cruz, she began moving on ambitious plans for the campus and emerged as an important voice in national higher education issues."</p><p>As he prepared to bestow the President's Medal during Denton's November 2005 investiture ceremony at UCSC, Dynes called Denton "a trailblazer in pursuit of equity and multiculturalism."</p><p>At UCSC, where she served for 16 months, Denton was remembered by Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David S. Kliger for her dedication "to opening doors for countless young people, particularly for women and minorities who wanted to pursue careers in engineering and science."</p><p>"She led this campus with clear statements of the importance of education in transforming lives and in creating opportunities for all," said Kliger. "She, herself, had lived that experience, rising from modest means to achieve with distinction at every stage in her life."</p><p>Last month, Denton won the 2006 Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award in recognition of her work advancing opportunities in science for women and girls. In 2004, she was among nine scholars honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring.</p><p>In receiving the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award, Denton was singled out by one juror for using "the power of her leadership position to raise the visibility of issues related to supporting and advancing women and girls in science-related careers both on and off the campus." Another juror cited Denton's creative strategies to build mentoring networks. "Where they are few in number on a campus, women scientists have followed Denton's cues to find and support each other," she said.</p><p>Even before she took office at UCSC, Denton made headlines when she publicly refuted remarks about innate differences between women and men made by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers during an academic conference Denton attended. Calling the ensuing uproar a "teachable moment," Denton spoke of the necessity to "speak truth to power."</p><p>Student leaders hailed Denton's openness and advocacy. "She was at the forefront of the UC Sweatshop Free Campaign, and showed her commitment to diversity by providing funding for student-initiated outreach programs," wrote representatives of the UCSC Student Union Assembly, Graduate Student Association, and UC Student Association.</p><p>Denton began her teaching career in 1987 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she was the only woman in the department of electrical and computer engineering and one of very few women in the College of Engineering. She also held academic appointments at the University of Massachusetts and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich.</p><p>At the University of Washington's College of Engineering, Denton co-founded the Center for Engineering, Learning and Teaching (CELT), a National Science Foundation program designed to improve engineering instruction. Other universities, including Harvard and Stanford, have modeled programs after it.</p><p>Denton often described her own experiences of isolation as a woman in a male-dominated field to underscore the need for greater outreach, and her accounts of those experiences resonated with many women in academia.</p><p>"It is with great sadness that I learn that a champion and role model for so many of us, Denice Denton, has passed away," said Betty Shanahan, executive director and chief executive officer of the Society of Women Engineers. "Her efforts in creating a more inclusive engineering profession have impacted not only many individuals but have benefited the entire profession."</p><p>Denton is survived by her partner Gretchen Kalonji; her mother, Carolyn Mabee; brother Deran Denton; sisters Derri Denton and Michelle Moore; as well as lifelong friend Dianna Beasley.</p><p>A campus celebration of Denton's life is set for Thursday, June 29, 2006, at 10 a.m., at the UC Santa Cruz Music Recital Hall.</p><p>At UCSC, a fund has been established to honor Chancellor Denton's vision and priorities for the campus. The Denice D. Denton Memorial Fund will pay tribute to her achievements as a leader in science and engineering, her advocacy for diversity, as well as her commitment to community.

Now researchers have established a more subtle effect of this shaking--it increases the permeability of rock to groundwater and other fluids. </p><p>The enhanced permeability caused by seismic shaking could potentially be harnessed to help extract oil from natural reservoirs, said Emily Brodsky, assistant professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"Permeability governs how fluid flows through rocks, whether it's water or oil, so this has practical implications for oil extraction," Brodsky said.</p><p>Brodsky is coauthor of a paper describing the new findings in the June 29 issue of <i>Nature.</i> The first author is Jean Elkhoury, a graduate student who worked with Brodsky at UCLA, and the other coauthor is Duncan Agnew of UC San Diego. </p><p>The study was based on two decades of data from the Piñon Flat Observatory in southern California, where researchers from UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography maintain an extensive geophysical observatory.</p><p>"It's probably one of the best-monitored pieces of land anywhere on Earth," Brodsky said.</p><p>The monitoring includes records of fluctuating water levels in wells. The water levels fluctuate in response to tidal effects similar to oceanic tides. In this case, the gravitational effects of the moon on the solid Earth squeeze and stretch the rocks in the crust, forcing water in and out of the wells from the surrounding rocks. The speed of the response in a well depends on the permeability of the surrounding rock.</p><p>"We know the tidal strain very well, so we can measure the lag between the imposed tidal strain and the response in the well to get a precise measure of the permeability of the rock," Brodsky said.</p><p>The researchers analyzed the data in relation to earthquakes and saw a striking correlation. "Every time there's a big earthquake in southern California, the permeability jumps. We saw this in two different wells for more than seven different earthquakes," Brodsky said.</p><p>After an earthquake, the rock surrounding the wells became as much as three times more permeable to groundwater, she said. Furthermore, the size of the increase in permeability was proportional to the peak amplitude of the shaking. The changes were transient, with permeability returning to the original level within a few months after an earthquake.</p><p>The oil industry might be able to exploit this phenomenon by using "vibroseis" trucks to send seismic waves into the ground. Currently used for seismic imaging studies, vibroseis trucks vibrate at a particular frequency for a prolonged period.</p><p>"If we understood the physics of the permeability enhancement well enough, the vibrations could be tuned to increase the flow of oil," Brodsky said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Brodsky at (831) 459-1854 or brodsky@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915008428072704601a012ffb3cbef1a"><name>898</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Denice Denton's life remembered in UC Santa Cruz memorial ceremony</title><author>Guy Lasnier (lasnier@ucsc.edu)</author><start-date>1151564400000</start-date><display-name>Denice Denton's life remembered...</display-name><path>/2006/06/898</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/898</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338195468</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338195468</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More than 1,000 people commemorated the vibrant life of Chancellor Denice D.

Many others followed it on the campuswide television network. </p><p>The ceremony was attended by University of California Regents, chancellors and UC President Robert C. Dynes. Chancellor France A. Cordova, of UC Riverside presided.</p><p>Denice "drew outside the lines, ran with scissors and spoke out of turn,'' said her sister Derri Denton, reading a family statement with sister Michelle Moore at her side. "Denice did not evolve. She arrived like an explosion, a sonic boom. From the moment she was born, we knew she was a special person, a unique individual, a gift from God."</p><p>Beginning with the words "vibrant, energetic, visionary, committed, creative, tireless, passionate, gifted, accomplished," Chancellor Cordova said Denton "believed deeply in what she espoused, led by example, and was an inspiration for girls and women in every arena, from kindergarten through the professoriate."</p><p>President Dynes and UCSC Professor Angela Davis each called Denton a pioneer. Dynes said that pioneering spirit made Denton a good fit as the chancellor for a pioneering campus. Davis called on the audience to "live her legacy" to achieve excellence through diversity, the theme of Denton's investiture speech just seven months ago. </p><p>Dynes said he has watched the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/celebration2005/">investiture speech from the UCSC web site</a> several times in the past week since Denton's death June 24 and has been struck again by her passion and vitality. </p><p>"She was a force, a magnificent force,'' said Donna Shalala in a letter read by UC Berkeley Professor Alice Agogino, as she summarized Denton's academic accomplishments and career achievements--not an easy task to do for a woman with a 50-page resume.</p><p>Shalala, president of the University of Miami and a past U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, chairs a National Academy committee producing a report "Women in Science and Engineering: A Guide to Maximizing their Potential." Agogino and Denton both served on the committee that has been meeting since last fall. The final report nearing completion is being dedicated to Denton, Agogino said. </p><p>Agogino recalled Denton's work in "mentoring mentors," particularly at the University of Wisconsin, where she had her first academic appointment, and later at the University of Washington, where she was the first female dean of engineering at a Class One research university. "She helped women succeed in their careers so they can mentor others," Agogino said. </p><p>"We have a long way to go," said Agogino, a professor of mechanical engineering, noting that "being at the forefront" made Denton a target. </p><p>She recalled Denton once advising others "to support your local senior feminist  colleagues. It's lonely at the top."</p><p>UCSC Music Professor Anatole Leiken provided a musical interlude on piano with a selection from Mozart's <i>Sonata in F major</i>.</p><p>At the ceremony's conclusion, many of those attending gathered at Kretschmer Plaza for a reception, while others attended a buffet lunch at University Center.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2789fc08072704601a012ffbccacb90"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626068382</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626068382</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2789fc08072704601a012ffbccacb90"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2006/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2006/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626068382</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626068382</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
