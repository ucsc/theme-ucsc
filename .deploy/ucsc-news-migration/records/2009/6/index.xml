(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta) </image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As students in caps and gowns gathered under warm sunshine on the East Field before Friday's commencement ceremonies, relatives waited breathlessly for a glimpse of their student and cheered in unabashed pride. Some joyfully ran up to their graduates and hugged them, kissed them, congratulated them, or swung pink-and-white leis over their heads.</p>
<p>An atmosphere of jubilation and accomplishment hung over commencement ceremonies, which kicked off Friday with the Graduate Division and continued through the weekend.</p>
<p>"Your achievements speak volumes to your dedication and perseverance," said Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies, in her remarks to the audience on Friday.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division commencement address was delivered by UCSC graduate alumna Lisa White, associate dean of the College of Science &amp; Engineering and professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>"Simply put," said White, "this graduating class is impressive."</p>
<p>Today's graduates have lived, worked, and interacted in a global community that is more multicultural and more connected than ever, she said, providing crucial skills in negotiation and communication.</p>
<p>"Whatever your degree today, your experience and training are so needed to provide leadership in the world," said White.</p>
<p>In addition to the Graduate Division, commencement exercises were held by UCSC's 10 colleges and the Baskin School of Engineering. A number of less formal celebrations also honored graduates.</p>
<p>A total of 2,105 UCSC students were awarded bachelor of arts, music, or science degrees. Also this spring, 309 students received master of arts, fine arts, or science degrees; of these students, 101 will complete UCSC's Department of Education master's program in late summer. In addition, 172 UCSC students were awarded doctorates. A small number of students received graduate certificates.</p>
<p>In the two prior quarters of the current academic year, many other UCSC students completed work for undergraduate or graduate degrees: 956 undergraduates earned bachelor's degrees, 57 students earned master's degrees, and 42 students earned doctorates.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 teams participated during the competition that culminated Friday, when seven finalists presented their plans to a panel of seven judges, who awarded the top three prizes. Audience members voted on the Peoples' Choice Award. The winners were:</p>
<p>. <strong>First place: Sustainabites Baby Food</strong> by Jackie Olin (B.A. community studies, 2008), a company that would offer fresh organic baby food made from local, organic produce grown sustainably on farms within 150 miles of Santa Cruz. Cash award of $12,000.</p>
<p>. <strong>Second place: Sky is the Limit</strong> by Chirag Sharma, a junior majoring in bioengineering and business management economics, would combat the widespread problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals by placing a nucleotide into each tablet during manufacturing. Cash award of $2,000.</p>
<p>. <strong>Third place: Lingua Earth</strong> by David Olsen, a graduate student in computer science, would use video-game technology to help busy people learn foreign languages. Cash award of $500.</p>
<p>. <strong>Peoples' Choice Award: Pherica</strong> by Jarrett Fishpaw, a graduate student in economics, would create high-tech tracking systems to help patients monitor the intake of their prescription medications. Cash award of $500.</p>
<p>The competition, which was open to all UCSC students and alumni who graduated in the last two years, was designed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity on campus and to increase awareness in the community and Silicon Valley of the resources available at UCSC. In opening remarks, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal noted the relationship between entrepreneurship and education, saying the competition would help build an "essential bridge between us."</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Philippe Kahn, chairman of Fullpower Technologies, delivered the keynote address to a festive gathering of more than 150 people during Friday's showcase at UCSC's University Center. Speaking without notes, Kahn, a high-tech inventor who built the first camera phone and holds dozens of other patents, captivated the audience with tales of his own roller-coaster ride in business, emphasizing the value of hard work--and luck.</p>
<p>"Do you think you're going to be more successful because you're lucky or smart?" Kahn asked moments before the winners were announced. "I'll pick luck any day." But he urged students to be open-minded about what constitutes luck and reminded the audience of his own wrenching experience of being ousted by the board of directors of Borland, his first company.</p>
<p>"But that turned out to be really lucky, because I got to build another company that was way more successful than the first company," said Kahn. "So the question for all the business plan teams today is, are you lucky to win or are you lucky to lose?"</p>
<p>For Jackie Olin, who has been teaching preschool while trying to launch her Sustainabites Baby Food company, that question was easy enough to answer. Holding the first-prize check for $12,000 aloft, she beamed and said, "This is such a surprise. I didn't think I could do it! This means we can stay in Santa Cruz!"</p>
<p>Cash awards were intended to help winning teams turn their ideas into reality, but event organizer Eric Gonzalez said each team that made it to the finals plans to move forward with its proposal. Gonzalez, who earned a B.A. in business management economics in March, spearheaded the drive for the campus's first business plan competition.</p>
<p>The success of the competition exceeded his wildest dreams, he said, noting the multi-pronged collaboration among students, community members, local government, industry representatives, and the university. "We've achieved much more than I ever thought we could," said Gonzalez. "Next year's will be even bigger."</p>
<p>The City of Santa Cruz Economic Development and Redevelopment Agency, which is working closely with UCSC to help create a culture of entrepreneurship in the community, played a key role in supporting the competition. "Pairing students with industry mentors who can provide expert tutelage expands the learning experience and reinforces the lessons of the classroom in real-world scenarios," said Peter Koht, the city's economic development coordinator.</p>
<p>The goal of the competition is to generate viable business ideas, emphasized economics professor Nirvikar Singh.</p>
<p>"This is a really important step forward in terms of the university and city working together," said Singh. "When you think about how the U.S. economy is changing, our comparative advantage is in creativity, design, and innovation. The campus can help with that. The essence of entrepreneurship is seeing opportunities and organizing a team that can satisfy a need in an effective way."</p>
<p>All seven teams that made it to the finals were winners, said several faculty members, including James Davis, professor of computer and information science, who secured a $15,000 UC Discovery Grant to fund the competition. "A lot of students have great ideas, but then they graduate, get a job, and the idea is lost," he said. "A competition like this gives students an opportunity to develop their ideas to the point that when they graduate, they have a real decision to make about whether they'll pursue it."</p>
<p>Teams worked hard to prepare their proposals, which averaged 35-70 pages in length, by attending workshops on defining target markets, identifying competitive advantage, funding strategies, and high-tech trends in engineering.</p>
<p>Opportunities have already opened up for participants, noted Mary Flannery, a lecturer in the Economics Department who judged the first round of the competition, which took place in February. Some students are considering graduate study to pursue their ideas, and at least one has been offered a research position to develop his plan, she said.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said his only regret is that he was too busy planning the event to participate in the competition: "I definitely would've been on a team," said Gonzalez, a former president of the University Economics Association whose own interests lean toward technology, with a focus on marketing and sales.</p>
<p>"This really cemented my faith in the education we're receiving at UCSC," said Gonzalez. "We're not just students trying to get by. We're going to make a difference."</p>
<p>Sponsors of the Business Plan Competition included the City of Santa Cruz Department of Economic Development and Redevelopment, the UC Discovery Grant, the Baskin School of Engineering, the Division of Social Sciences, and the UCSC Foundation. Judging the competition were Cliff Warren, president and CEO of Raytek Corporation; Judy Owen, general partner of Calumet Venture Capital; Laura Bushnell, partner of Latham &amp; Watkins; Krishna "Kittu" Kolluri, general partner of New Enterprise Associates; T. Chester Wang, cofounder and managing member of Acorn Campus; Ted Goldstein (B.A. computer and information sciences, Oakes College, 1983), entrepreneur and former vice president of Apple Computer; and Robert Blumberg, managing director of the Soquel Group (B.A. information sciences, Cowell College, 1976). In addition, dozens of business leaders volunteered their time to mentor teams.</p>

<p>UC College Prep, a statewide program of the University of California based at UC Santa Cruz, will house its state- and College Board-approved online courses and digital lessons on the K-12 network's servers so that California high schools can easily pull down the courses to teach online at no cost. The network's <a href="http://www.k12hsn.org/calaxy">Calaxy web site</a> includes a wealth of resources such as free access to a learning management system needed to teach online credit-bearing courses. Rather than acquiring and maintaining servers and technology to instruct the courses, schools can access the courses and content through the network.</p>
<p>Automatic access to UC College Prep courses on the network will be available later this year. UC College Prep and K-12 High Speed Network are currently building a content bank and other features for a piloted implementation that will precede the statewide implementation of the courses. In the meantime, schools and school districts may license courses directly from UC College Prep and use the courses independently.</p>
<p>"This partnership gives UC College Prep a central distribution point to help a greater number of students become college eligible or enhance their academic achievement," said Rafael Granados, executive director of UC College Prep. "We look forward to contributing new content to the network and expanding the partnership. This is a perfect blending of quality online content with a sophisticated system and ready tools to make using that content workable for any California school."</p>
<p>The agreement will make over $8 million worth of high-quality, interactive online courses and lessons developed by UC available to the entire state through one centralized portal. Another $5 million worth of online course content will be added to the network in the next two years. Concurrently, UC College Prep will construct a special Web portal on the network offering sophisticated math lessons, including algebra and California High School Exit Examination resources, to serve the state's algebra and math development needs. UC College Prep's goal is to eventually provide the network with the entire college prep curriculum.</p>
<p>"We are excited to be working with UCCP in meeting the needs of schools across California," said Todd Finnell, chief executive officer of the K12HSN. "The ability to leverage the resources of each organization and coordinate our services will ensure students in all areas of the state have access to compelling content and learning opportunities."</p>
<p>The two programs will also collaborate on a pilot to reach rural and underserved schools so students and teachers in dire need of Advanced Placement and college prep courses may access UC College Prep's approved courses through the network. Both organizations are dedicated to providing access to materials through technology for the advancement of students everywhere in California with a special emphasis on underserved students.</p>
<p>Founded in 1999, UC College Prep develops and distributes UC-approved online Advanced Placement and other college prep courses for use by California teachers and students. Its courses are considered some of the highest quality multimedia courses in the world. Last year, over 83,000 California students used UCCP's online content and over 153,000 students across the world accessed UC online course content.

<p>The California K-12 High Speed Network enables educators, students and staff across the state to have access to a reliable high-speed network with the capacity to deliver high-quality online resources to support teaching and learning and promote academic achievement. K12HSN is a state program funded by the California Department of Education. For more information on K12HSN, visit <a href="http://www.k12hsn.org">www.k12hsn.org</a>.</p>

(Photo by Gilbert Solorio)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For 23 years, Brandin Engersbach's mother operated a day care out of the family's home in the Highland Park district of east Los Angeles. But last June, the state funding she received for offering child care for low-income parents was cut off, a casualty of the state budget turmoil. </p><p>As a result, the day care saw a rapid decrease in business--a frightening development, since Engersbach's father was forced to retire 10 years ago after being diagnosed with cancer, and the day care was the family's only source of income.</p><p>The situation left Engersbach, 20, a third-year legal studies and politics major, in desperate financial straits when it came to affording college. He was forced to withdraw from UCSC for a quarter, return to Los Angeles, and find work to help his family and save for school. The following quarter, he applied for and received more financial aid than he had in his first two years at UCSC. His financial aid package includes grants, loans, and work-study; through the work-study program he is employed part-time in the Financial Aid office.</p><p>"I could not afford this on my own," Engersbach said. "It would be impossible."</p><p>Engersbach isn't alone in his plight. With the global economy reeling and the state budget in crisis, applications to UCSC's Financial Aid office have been edging upward, and the office has been seeing more and more cases like Engersbach's, said Ann Draper, director of financial aid. </p><p>"These are the kinds of stories that are coming to us on a daily basis," Draper said. </p><p>The Financial Aid Office has seen a 5 percent increase in applications for aid compared with last year at this time, according to Draper. She attributed the rise to the battered economy.  </p><p>"We're seeing appeals from a lot of families where one or more parent has lost their job or they've lost their home," Draper said. </p><p>In other cases, the value of parents' college savings and investments has dropped.</p><p>She expects to see an increase in parents' federal loan applications in July, as well as a rise in student borrowing. </p><p>Engersbach said friends and Sigma Phi Zeta fraternity brothers--students whose parents had been footing the bill for college--have recently approached him to ask how to apply for aid. </p><p><b>Economic turmoil ripples outward</b></p><p>Second-year history and politics major Jonathan Castillo, 20, has a similar story to Engersbach's. </p><p>His parents are divorced. Before college, he lived in Pomona with his dad, a mechanic for an armored truck company. Most of his dad's income comes from overtime, but with the souring economy, the armored truck company's business has slowed. The company began pulling trucks off the road, which meant less work for mechanics. </p><p>"He's been with the company for 30 years, and even though he basically feels like he's given this company his life, there's no job security for him," said Castillo.</p><p>His father contributes to his college expenses, said Castillo, but "at great burden to him." In addition to his dad's contribution, Castillo, who is also a work-study student in the Financial Aid office, receives grants and loans to attend UCSC. </p><p>Regardless of the financial strain, Castillo's dad tells him the advantage of higher education is worth the struggle. </p><p>"It's his dream for me to go to school," said Castillo, who is the first in his family to attend college. "I didn't think about anything after high school but going to college. I had that mindset even as a little kid. I can't imagine this being taken away from me."</p><p>If Castillo's father were to be laid off, said Draper, "we can re-evaluate Jonathan's eligibility for financial aid. People can come to us with updated financial information." </p><p>Even with financial aid, both Engersbach and Castillo expect to be $20,000 in debt upon graduation. </p><p><b>Cost of college: up, up, up</b></p><p>A national trend has emerged in the past decade, said Draper: financial aid funding has not kept pace with the rise in the total cost of education.  </p><p>The net cost of attending college for nine months has increased 80 percent in the past 10 years, she said, the result of fee hikes and both on- and off-campus housing cost increases. </p><p>In 2009-10, the total cost for a student living on campus at UCSC is estimated to be $27,500. That includes fees, food and housing, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses. </p><p>Ten years ago, the total cost was $13,955. </p><p>In 1999-2000, fees were 30 percent of the cost, housing 53 percent, and the remainder 17 percent. </p><p>For 2009-10, fees are 37 percent, housing 50 percent, and everything else 14 percent. </p><p>The rise in fees has come in part as the state has decreased its funding for the UC system.</p><p>President Obama's stimulus package provides more funds for college through the federal Pell Grant program, and UC has also enlarged its grant funding to help offset the increase in fees and other costs. </p><p>However, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed last week to phase out Cal Grants and cut back existing awards as part of a stunning package of deep cuts to balance the state's $24.3 billion deficit after the failure of the May ballot measures.</p><p>To illustrate the impact Cal Grants have at UCSC, Draper said that if Cal Grants had been eliminated in 2008-09, UCSC students would have lost $26.3 million, which represents 33 percent of the total grant funds UCSC students receive, comprised of state, federal, and UC grants. </p><p>The grants help low and middle-income families, and currently 28 percent of UCSC undergrads receive them, said Draper. However, she explained, the impact of eliminating Cal Grants would be felt by half of UCSC's undergraduates because there would be less total grant money to spread around.</p><p>But she cautioned that the governor's proposal to eliminate the Cal Grant program for new students is "only a proposal at this time and must be approved by the Legislature."</p><p>"Our hope is that state budget issues will ultimately be resolved with the Cal Grant program intact," Draper said. "However, if the proposal passes, we will do what we can to mitigate the impacts on UC Santa Cruz students and their families."</p><p>"I'm pretty upset because I don't know what I'm going to do if that gets cut," said Castillo, who receives about $7,500 a year in Cal Grants--roughly a third of his total financial aid package. "I won't be able to go to school if that happens. I feel like all my plans could come to a halt."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b84188072704601a012ff56ec226a"><name>3009</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Volunteers keep watch as urban falcons embark on first flights</title><summary>As young peregrine falcons prepare to take their first flights in San Francisco and San Jose, volunteers watch from sidewalks and rooftops to help the birds if they get into trouble.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><description>As young peregrine falcons prepare to take their first flights in San Francisco and San Jose, volunteers watch from sidewalks and rooftops to help the birds if they get into trouble.</description><start-date>1243926000000</start-date><display-name>Volunteers keep watch as...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3009</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3009</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338948037</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338948037</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/06/images/falcons_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/06/images/falcons_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>falcons_300.jpg</name><file-size>64209</file-size><width>300</width><height>304</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Volunteer falcon watcher Glenn Nevill captured this mid-air food exchange between Dapper Dan (above) and Diamond Lil (below), a falcon pair nesting on the PG&amp;E building in San Francisco.

Photo by Amy Standen.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It's become a rite of spring: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/peregrine_cam.htm">Webcams</a> at peregrine falcon nests in San Francisco and San Jose give people around the world an intimate view of falcon family life via the Internet. Now, as the fledglings prepare to take their first flights, volunteers have signed up in droves to watch from sidewalks and rooftops for hours at a time and, if the birds get into trouble, rescue them from urban perils.</p>
<p>Glenn Stewart, coordinator of the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG), said the citizen involvement in this program has been amazing.</p>
<p>"I've got 73 volunteers signed up this year, mostly to help with the fledge watch," Stewart said. "We need people watching to make sure the fledglings don't end up on the ground and unable to get to a safe perch. If needed, we give the birds elevator rides up to the roof."</p>
<p>Many of the volunteers get involved after seeing the falcons on one of SCPBRG's webcams and joining an online discussion group to learn more about the birds. "I put regular posts on the discussion groups to explain what's happening with the birds, like how fast their feathers grow. People ask questions, and over time they become very well-informed falcon watchers. It truly is educational," Stewart said.</p>
<p>Peregrine falcons have been nesting on the PG&amp;E building in downtown San Francisco since 2003. A webcam, operated by SCPBRG with funding from PG&amp;E, has been monitoring the San Francisco nests since 2005.</p>
<p>"People love the peregrines because they're beautiful birds, and they're an endangered species success story," said Glenn Nevill of San Francisco, who has been involved as a volunteer since 2005 and posts photos of the falcons on his <a href="http://www.raptor-gallery.com">web site</a>.</p>
<p>In San Jose, SCPBRG installed a nest box on a ledge at City Hall in 2006 after peregrine falcons were seen perching on the building. A webcam funded by the City of San Jose was up and running for the 2007 nesting season.</p>
<p>Evet Loewen, chief deputy city attorney for San Jose, has been a driving force behind organizing the volunteers and getting city funding for the webcam, Stewart said. Loewen established a small nonprofit group, the San Jose Peregrine Falcon Alliance, to support SCPBRG and promote avian conservation and education. The group's activities include raising funds through a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/sanjosefalcons">Cafe Press store</a>, moderating the online forum, and running a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SanJosePFA">YouTube site</a> and a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23930319@N03/">Flickr site</a> featuring the San Jose falcons.</p>
<p>Loewen said she began seeing raptors when she first moved into her offices in the new City Hall building in 2005, although she couldn't identify them until an experienced birder pointed out a peregrine falcon. After learning about the San Francisco webcam and following the falcons there, she was determined to get a webcam for the San Jose falcons and began lobbying city leaders.</p>
<p>"Once we got the webcam installed, we had a blockbuster first season, with such good press and people watching from all over the world," Loewen said. "Last year we had about a dozen volunteers, including one who flew in from Missouri. This year, one of our board members flew in from Michigan, and we have some volunteers who come from Nevada."</p>
<p>In 2007, all three of the young in the San Jose nest "fledged up," meaning they didn't have to be rescued from the ground. But in 2008, all three fledglings had to be picked up and returned to the roof.</p>
<p>"After that year, it was clear to me that we needed a larger, more organized volunteer group during fledge watch," Loewen said. "I wrote a proposal to establish a group of trained volunteers, and our organization got walkie-talkies for the volunteers to use."</p>
<p>Stewart held training sessions in San Jose and San Francisco for fledge watch volunteers, and Loewen's group videotaped one of the sessions so that people who missed a session could still get trained.</p>
<p>"It's an amazing thing to have all this support," Stewart said. "We are using the peregrine falcon as a gateway species for building public interest in the conservation of nature. People get interested through the webcams, then they buy a pair of binoculars, get interested in other birds, and they become conservationists."</p>
<p>"This is one of those experiences that draws people in," Loewen said. "It's a great educational opportunity to learn about the natural world. We get comments on the forum all the time from teachers who use the webcam in their classrooms. It's an unparalleled opportunity to teach about conservation to a wide range of ages."</p>
<p>Established at UCSC in 1975, the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group was instrumental in the recovery of the peregrine falcon population, which was in danger of extinction in the 1970s due to the effects of the pesticide DDT. During the population recovery effort, SCPBRG scientists released more than 1,000 captive-raised peregrine falcons into the wild.</p>
<p>Stewart estimates there are now more than 250 nesting pairs in California. The peregrine falcon was removed from the federal endangered species list in 1999, and last year the California Fish and Game Commission recommended removing it from the state endangered species list as well.</p>
<p>SCPBRG is now part of the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>, a science education center based at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. The Seymour Center, which has a large group of volunteer docents, is helping to coordinate the SCPBRG volunteer programs. In addition to the fledge watch, Stewart has trained a smaller group of volunteers to conduct observations of peregrine falcon nests in the wild, building on 30 years of data collected by SCPBRG staff to track nesting success rates.</p>

It was the first time I was able to discuss race, class, and gender in an academic setting. My instructor, Susan Gorsky, provided multiple opportunities to challenge and improve my writing skills and critical thinking abilities. This class was one of my first college classes and it gave me the tools I needed to be successful in my later college classes. I truly appreciate the class and especially my instructor. </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>I had the opportunity to be part of Colleges Nine and Ten Alternative Spring Break in New Orleans. It was a powerful experience. Most individuals that I have encountered are under the impression that New Orleans is back to normal since Hurricane Katrina hit. Sadly, after almost four years nothing has been done by the government to improve or support Katrina victims. Volunteers are responsible for all change that has taken place in New Orleans. I was blessed to have this learning and life-changing experience. Alternative Spring Break 2009 is my most memorable experience here at UCSC.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b> </p><p>There is a bench at Cowell College that faces the ocean. It is the most beautiful sight to see. Whenever I feel the need to catch a break from the stressful realities of my life, I go there. That bench with that view is my equivalence to tranquility. It is my favorite place on campus, because it reminds me of all my blessings and privileges.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b> </p><p>UCSC has played a significant role in shaping the woman that I am today. All of my college experiences have not only provided opportunities to learn more about myself, but have also given me insight on how to improve certain aspects of my life.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>I ultimately plan on opening my own school and designing a self-esteem camp for young underprivileged girls. </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>I have always been interested in anything related to creating positive change. With that said, I decided to choose College Ten because of its social justice and community theme. My College Ten experience made opportunities to learn about different cultural perspectives more tangible. I even had several opportunities to take part in volunteer-based programs geared toward social change.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b> </p><p>I am a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society. I will be graduating in the top 15 percent of my class. With that said, I have worked really hard throughout my time here at UCSC. I am looking forward to graduating and beginning a new chapter in my life.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b89808072704601a012ff0682df68"><name>3013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate student documentaries featured during reception and screenings on June 12-13</title><summary>Graduate students in Social Documentation present the Third Annual Master's Thesis Exhibition June 12-13. </summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>rich, tajima-pena, graduate, social documentation, community studies, exhibition, screening, reception, video, audio, film, photography, student</keywords><description>Graduate students in Social Documentation present the Third Annual Master's Thesis Exhibition June 12-13. </description><start-date>1244098800000</start-date><display-name>Graduate student documentaries featured...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3013</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3013</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338949420</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338949420</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/06/images/rich_reception.310.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/06/images/rich_reception.310.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rich_reception.310.jpg</name><file-size>47068</file-size><width>310</width><height>207</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>In his film about water in El Salvador, filmmaker Jason Wallach asks if water is a human right or a commodity.

<p>Members of the Class of 2009 will present their works, which have been filmed, photographed, and recorded in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and across the United States, during <a href="http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/graduate/">two upcoming public events</a>. On Friday, June 12, a public reception/gallery show will feature audio, photographic, and multimedia documentaries from 6-8 p.m. in Baskin Visual Arts, Rooms D-101, I-200, and J-101. On Saturday, June 13, video documentaries will take place from 1-6 p.m. in the Baskin Engineering Auditorium.</p>
<p>Both events are free and open to the public, although attendees are encouraged to use public transportation if possible due to the limited parking options on campus during graduation weekend. Parking on Friday will be available at the Performing Arts Parking Lot, and on Saturday at the Core West Structure. Guests are advised to use the West Entrance and let attendants know they are on campus for the social documentation reception or screening.</p>
<p>The Master of Arts in Social Documentation is a two-year graduate program focused on the development of expertise in the understanding and production of social documentaries in the genres of video, film, photography, audio, public ethnography, museum installation, and new media.</p>
<p>"This is only the third year of the program, and already UCSC students are at the forefront of a new wave of documentarians," said Renee Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies.</p>
<p>The foundation of the program lies in its social science approach to sociopolitical issues, prioritizing the graphic expression of people's lives and cultures, the conditions under which they work to sustain themselves, challenges to their survival, and strategies for improving their lives.</p>
<p>Highlights of the <a href="http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/graduate/">Third Annual Master's Thesis Exhibition</a> include:</p>
<p>. <em>The Pink Bubble</em> by Valerie Krex, a film that tells the bittersweet tale of Mary Kay Cosmetics saleswoman Hannah Price, a mixed-race working mother whose quest to become middle class focuses on the ultimate symbol of Mary Kay success: the pink Cadillac.</p>
<p>. Photographer Amanda Abel's project, <em>Closer to Home</em>, documents the lives of people whose commitment to a sustainable lifestyle includes living in tiny homes (70-400 square feet per person).</p>
<p>. In <em>Until the Last Drop: Tales from El Salvador's Agua-apocalypse</em>, filmmaker Jason Wallach examines two visions of water management in El Salvador, where 40 percent of residents have no potable water in their homes. In El Salvador, which receives three times the world's average rainfall annually, is water a human right or a commodity to be bought and sold?</p>
<p>. Chris Newman's film <em>Finding D-QU: The Lonely Struggle of California's only Tribal College</em> documents the struggle to reopen D-Q University, which was shut down in 2005. The film explores stories of hope, healing, and conflict as supporters fight to hold on to a dream that was never fully realized.</p>
<p>Graduates have also tackled global issues such as food security, gender-based killing, and access to health care; explored cultural tourism and the enforcement of normative body types; and documented the disability rights movement.</p>

<p>Fortunately, campus and county officials ultimately determined that the object prompting the activation was not a safety threat (see <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=3012">same-day campus message</a>).</p>
<p>Still, the activation - and feedback we received from many people on campus - helped us understand what worked and what could have worked better about this still-new alert system.</p>
<p>Here is the feedback we received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many people let us know that the system worked well and provided them with real-time information about a report that had closed the campus's main entrance.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Some members of the campus community voiced concerns about the number of text messages and e-mails that were sent during the activation. The default configuration for the CruzAlert system was set to send text and e-mail messages three times to ensure receipt of the message. As a result of this feedback, however, we now realize that this led to excessive message traffic and that most cell phone users pay per message for text messages. We are therefore reconfiguring the system; during future activations, only one text message and/or e-mail message will be sent to each recipient. Follow-up messages, including "all clear" messages, will still be sent only as necessary.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Some concerns were raised about the length of time it took for e-mail and phone call messages to be delivered. Delivery of text messages appears to have occurred relatively quickly, which is why we encourage anyone with a cell phone with text messaging capabilities to register their number in CruzAlert as this is often the fastest delivery method. E-mail delivery appears to have been delayed on some e-mail accounts, and we are assessing the cause; and phone calls unfortunately do take time.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Questions have been asked about how often CruzAlert messages will be sent. CruzAlert has been operational since September 2008, and this was the first activation of the system other than for very limited roll-out testing. Yet, please be reassured that we will deploy the system only when an emergency - or threat of an emergency - warrants its use.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Concerns were also raised about the small amount of information presented in this first transmission. CruzAlert is intended to quickly transmit a message in the early stages of an emergency; the more we say the longer it takes to transmit. In addition, text messages are limited to 140 characters, which means messages must be short, concise, and possibly even grammatically incorrect in order to get the most information out. Please remember that CruzAlert is not intended to be the only source of information. At the time that Thursday's messages were sent, for example, the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">main campus homepage</a>, the campus <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu&quot;">emergency management website</a>, and the campus's 459-INFO emergency hotline were updated with more detailed information. Whether prompted by a CruzAlert message or not, please make it a habit to use these other resources during a real emergency or threat of one.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Finally, I encourage you to make sure that the CruzAlert system has your current information. Changes to your registered numbers and e-mail addresses can be made by going to <a href="http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu">cruzalert.ucsc.edu</a> and following the appropriate link for either students or faculty/staff. This web site also provide more information about the system and how it is used. More specific questions can be sent to <a href="mailto:alert@ucsc.edu">alert@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Guest will receive a $10,000 scholarship to help pay for medical school fees and tuition.</p>
<p>"With a critical shortage of primary care physicians in our area, we feel it is important to encourage undergraduates with plans for medical school to pursue primary care, especially for the underserved in our community," said Ric Nichols, administrator of SMSC.</p>
<p>Guest said she hopes to return to the Central Coast to practice as an obstetrician/gynecologist after completing her medical training. Before applying to medical schools, she plans to travel to South America and take language classes in Argentina to strengthen her Spanish language skills.</p>
<p>"It is a great honor to receive the Sutter award," Guest said. "This award not only brought me closer to financially achieving my goal of becoming a doctor, but it also put into perspective why I am choosing this career path and added to all the excitement and motivation I have for becoming a physician in the Central Coast region."</p>
<p>Throughout her five years at UCSC, Guest has worked with developmentally disabled athletes as a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2832">Special Olympics coach</a>. She is currently director of Special Olympics for Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The award supports a graduating senior with a major in health sciences at UCSC who will be entering an accredited medical school soon after successfully completing his or her bachelor's degree. The recipient's medical training must result in an M.D. or D.O. degree and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast of California to practice in the area of primary care. The funds are intended to help meet the student's requirements for fees and tuition.</p>
<p>"Brittany is an excellent choice for the award," said Alan McKay, executive director of the Central Coast Alliance for Health. "She has been working locally as an intern and speaks Spanish. We wish her luck and look forward to seeing her back here as a doctor."</p>
<p>Candidates for the award are recommended by UCSC's Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology to a committee comprised of representatives from SMSC, the Alliance, and the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency. There is no implied obligation or requirement that the award recipient shall be on staff at any particular organization in the area, but he or she will be expected to serve Medi-Cal patients.</p>

<p>The standard method for estimating pulsar ages is known to yield unreliable results, especially for the fast-spinning millisecond pulsars, said BÃ¼lent Kiziltan, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>"An accurate determination of pulsar ages is of fundamental importance, because it has ramifications for understanding the formation and evolution of pulsars, the physics of neutron stars, and other areas," he said.</p>
<p>Kiziltan has been working with Stephen Thorsett, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, to study the evolution of millisecond pulsars. He will present their new findings at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Pasadena on Monday, June 8.</p>
<p>A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star, the collapsed core that remains after a massive star explodes as a supernova. The pulsar emits beams of radio waves (as well as x-rays and gamma-rays) from the magnetic poles of the neutron star. Because the magnetic poles are not aligned with the star's spin axis, the beams sweep around like a lighthouse beacon, sending pulses of radio waves toward observers on Earth. The period between each pulse of radio waves corresponds to the rotation rate of the neutron star.</p>
<p>"In most cases, the only information we have is the radio pulse we receive from these compact stars. From these pulses we are trying to determine the ages, masses, and orbital parameters--a very challenging task indeed," Kiziltan said.</p>
<p>Ordinary pulsars tend to rotate a few times per second, and they gradually slow down with age, eventually becoming too faint to detect. Millisecond pulsars, however, rotate hundreds of time per second. They achieve these extraordinary spin rates by pulling in material from a binary companion star, a process that transfers angular momentum from the companion to the pulsar.</p>
<p>"This spin-up process is essentially like giving CPR to a dead or dying pulsar, giving it a second lease on life," Kiziltan said.</p>
<p>The standard approach to determine the "characteristic" or "spin-down" age of a pulsar is based on two parameters: the period between pulses and the rate at which they slow down. Kiziltan and Thorsett showed that this method may over- or under-estimate the age of a pulsar by a factor of 10 when applied to millisecond pulsars.</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy of the standard technique, they incorporated additional constraints that arise from the spin-up process and physical limits on the maximum spin period. "We modified the age calculations to be consistent with these constraints and showed that this approach can achieve estimates closer to the true age of the pulsar," Kiziltan said.</p>
<p>They show that, in some cases, millisecond pulsars that appear to be young can, in fact, be several billion years older. In other cases, young millisecond pulsars may mimic the characteristics of pulsars that are as old as the galaxy itself.</p>
<p>A paper describing the new findings will be submitted to the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>According to the UC Santa Cruz researchers who led the project, these flows represent a significant and previously overlooked source of mercury in the nearshore marine environment.</p>
<p>"The big question for public health is, 'Where is all the mercury in seafood coming from?'" said Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology at UCSC and a coauthor of the study. "What we have shown is that methylmercury is coming from groundwater in California at surprisingly high levels."</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed mercury in submarine groundwater flows at Stinson Beach in Marin County and Elkhorn Slough in Monterey County and reported their findings in an article published online in <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>. They found that the amount of mercury injected into coastal waters from groundwater is about the same as the contribution from airborne mercury falling out of the sky (a process called atmospheric deposition).</p>
<p>More importantly, the groundwater appears to contain relatively high levels of methylmercury, the highly toxic form of mercury that accumulates in the marine food chain and poses a public health problem in most regions of the world, according to the <a href="http://www.mercury2006.org/Default.aspx?tabid=1568">Madison Conference Declaration on Mercury Pollution</a>.</p>
<p>The study was funded by California Sea Grant, a program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Previous studies have documented the presence of methylmercury in terrestrial groundwater. Fewer studies, though, have observed methylmercury in coastal waters.</p>
<p>"What makes this study interesting is the idea that methylmercury is forming in coastal groundwater," said Cynthia Gilmour, a microbial ecologist and senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md. "We don't know very much about the sources of methylmercury to coastal waters. It is a hot topic."</p>
<p>She says that the study's findings, however, are consistent with "a growing consensus that coastal fishes are acquiring mercury from methylmercury produced in the coastal zone."</p>
<p>On a global average, the amount of mercury falling out of the sky has tripled since the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago, due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels. "As a result, most mercury today enters most landscapes through atmospheric deposition," Gilmour said. This mercury is converted into the methylmercury by sulfur- and iron-reducing bacteria, which reside in wet, low-oxygen soils and sediments.</p>
<p>"People have assumed that methylmercury must come from the bottom of the ocean or from surface waters flowing to the coast, but never from groundwater," said UCSC biogeochemist Adina Paytan, also a coauthor.</p>
<p>The scientists did not attempt to identify the sources of mercury in groundwater. But Frank Black, a former doctoral student at UC Santa Cruz, now a postdoctoral researcher in biogeochemistry at Princeton University and the study's lead author, believes that some of the inorganic mercury is likely coming from natural processes such as weathering of local mercury-containing rocks. Mining and other human activities are also likely sources of mercury in soils and sediments.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding where inorganic mercury is converted into methylmercury, Black believes that septic tanks in the vicinity of Stinson Beach, because they provide nutrients to methylating bacteria, may be contributing to methylmercury formation. At Elkhorn Slough, the leading theory is that groundwater is flushing out methylmercury from sediments where it is being produced.</p>
<p>In addition to Black, Paytan and Flegal, the coauthors of the paper include Karen Knee and Nicholas de Sieyes of Stanford University and Priya Ganguli and Ellen Gray of UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Banks and Fischler, who are being honored on the occasion of their 60th birthdays, have been influential thinkers on a broad range of topics in theoretical physics, both individually and in collaboration with each other and with other physicists.</p>
<p>"Their impact on the field is reflected in the people who are coming to the symposium--it is a very distinguished group," said Michael Dine, professor of physics at UCSC and chair of the committee organizing the symposium. The speakers will include two Nobel Laureates and five MacArthur Fellows.</p>
<p>The development of string theory, an ambitious attempt to find a unified theory of the forces of nature, is one area in which Banks and Fischler, as well as many of the speakers at the symposium, have made important contributions. The first proposal for a complete formulation of string theory was presented in a widely known paper published in 1997 by Banks, Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind. Known as the Matrix theory, it gave rise to many later developments, according to Nathan Seiberg of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>"In that sense, it was very important," Seiberg said. "But these two individuals have had an enormous impact on the field, and to focus on that one contribution would give an oversimplified impression of their impact. The range of their contributions is really unusual."</p>
<p>Susskind, the Felix Bloch professor of physics at Stanford University, said both Banks and Fischler have been major presences in almost all aspects of theoretical high-energy physics for the past 30 years. "Everybody who knows the subject would consider them two of the great leaders of theoretical physics, both in their own work and by inspiring others with their ideas," he said.</p>
<p>Banks and Fischler have done important work in areas such as the physics of black holes, particle physics, quantum gravity, and quantum field theory. Banks has written a new textbook on quantum field theory (<em>Modern Quantum Field Theory: A Concise Introduction</em>, Cambridge University Press, 2008), which Seiberg said is destined to become a classic.</p>
<p>"Tom Banks is one of the best teachers in the field. If I have a question, I come to Tom and I get an answer--he's like an encyclopedia," Seiberg said. "I am proud to have been his student as an undergraduate, and throughout my career I have learned an enormous amount from him."</p>
<p>The title of the symposium is "Confronting Challenges in Theoretical Physics," and speakers will address the latest developments in many of the areas in which Banks and Fischler have done important work.</p>
<p>"Although the talks will reflect the work they have done, it won't be retrospective. The idea is for people to lay out their visions for where the field is going," Dine said.</p>
<p>Seiberg and Susskind will be among the speakers. Others will include David Gross of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara; Steven Weinberg of UT Austin; and many other leading theoreticians. Abraham Seiden, director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics at UCSC, will discuss new experimental results expected from projects such as the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>On June 4, Chancellor George Blumenthal honored and acknowledged the diversity achievements of three academic employees, two staff employees, and one campus unit at the 2009 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity, presented at the University Center.</p>
<p>"We want to build on our successes of attracting a student body that is ethnically diverse, and includes students who are first in their families to attend college and come from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>UCSC has many academic and staff employees and programs that contribute significantly to diversity efforts, and these awards are intended to reinforce and institutionalize diversity as a priority and necessity for the campus.</p>
<p>The 2009 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity recipients are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eugene Switkes,</strong> professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, for leadership in promoting diversity in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). <br/>
<br/>

</li>

<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Adriane Steinacker,</strong> adjunct associate professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, for inclusive teaching and mentoring, and supporting a diverse cohort of third-year physics transfer students in their transition to UCSC.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Shante Lewis,</strong> Education Abroad Program adviser, for promoting diversity in the study abroad experience, by conducting research and addressing race and discrimination issues.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Theikdi,</strong> book buyer, Bay Tree Bookstore, for establishing a dynamic reading series that represents and promotes the accomplishments of our diverse faculty and alumni.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Educational Partnership Center,</strong> for fostering college-bound communities that improve student learning and increase college-going rates among students from low-income and traditional non-college-going families.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>This year, graduating students at one of UC Santa Cruz's 10 undergraduate colleges will take the pledge during commencement exercises. College Eight graduates will take the Graduation Pledge Alliance for the second consecutive year, on Saturday, June 13 (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2949">see schedule of UCSC commencements</a>).</p>
<p>Nearly 150 colleges and universities are participating in the pledge this spring. In line with the College Eight's theme of environmental awareness and social responsibility, the pledge is a way for students to carry on what they learned over the years at UCSC and apply it to the next phase of their lives-whether they go on to graduate school or embark on their careers in the workforce.</p>
<p>Students taking the Graduation Pledge affirm the following: "I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work."</p>
<p>The pledge was started at Humboldt State University in 1987 to help create awareness for how personal life choices could help bring about change to the world students want to be living in. National pledge organizers are optimistic about the future growth of the pledge, given the Obama Administration's commitment to public service and civic engagement.</p>
<p>Currently UC Santa Cruz is the only UC to participate in this pledge. College Eight students hope to expand this pledge to other colleges at UCSC and to other campuses within the UC system.</p>
<p>This year's pledge has been organized by College Eight Programming Coordinator Mike Kittredge and student graduation planning committee members Hannah Maurer, Ryan Estes, Lauren Fieberg, Jennifer Pimentel, Arya Shoraka, and Jessica Wakenhut.</p>

Some joyfully ran up to their graduates and hugged them, kissed them, congratulated them, or swung pink-and-white leis over their heads.</p>
<p>An atmosphere of jubilation and accomplishment hung over commencement ceremonies, which kicked off Friday with the Graduate Division and continued through the weekend.</p>
<p>"Your achievements speak volumes to your dedication and perseverance," said Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies, in her remarks to the audience.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division commencement address was delivered by UCSC graduate alumna Lisa White, associate dean of the College of Science &amp; Engineering and professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>"Simply put," said White, "this graduating class is impressive."</p>
<p>Today's graduates have lived, worked, and interacted in a global community that is more multicultural and more connected than ever, she said, providing crucial skills in negotiation and communication.</p>
<p>"Whatever your degree today, your experience and training are so needed to provide leadership in the world," said White.</p>
<p>In addition to the Graduate Division, commencement exercises were held by UCSC's 10 colleges and the Baskin School of Engineering. A number of less formal celebrations also honored graduates.</p>
<p>A total of 2,105 UCSC students were candidates for bachelor of arts, music, or science degrees. Also this spring, 309 students were eligible to receive master of arts, fine arts, or science degrees; of these students, 101 will complete UCSC's Department of Education master's program in late summer. In addition, 172 UCSC students were candidates for doctorates. A small number of students received graduate certificates.</p>
<p>In the two prior quarters of the current academic year, many other UCSC students completed work for undergraduate or graduate degrees: 956 undergraduates earned bachelor's degrees, 57 students earned master's degrees, and 42 students earned doctorates.</p>

We've designed these molecules to do just that," said Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC. </p><p>Nitric oxide is a simple molecule with a wide range of biological effects. Long known for its role in regulating blood pressure, it has attracted the attention of cancer researchers in recent years. According to Mascharak, one advantage of nitric oxide for cancer treatment is that it induces an orderly type of cell death known as apoptosis. Also known as "programmed cell death," apoptosis does not lead to the inflammation, pain, and swelling normally associated with damage to cells and tissues in the body. </p><p>The drugs currently used in photodynamic therapy, called photosensitizers, produce a highly reactive form of oxygen when activated by light. The reactive oxygen kills cells in a way that tends to cause local swelling and inflammation.</p><p>Mascharak and graduate student Michael Rose have synthesized several different ruthenium nitrosyls in their lab. They described these compounds in detail in a recent paper published in <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i> (published online May 29, 2009). In another paper published last year in the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>, the researchers reported that the compounds were effective against breast cancer cells in laboratory experiments. </p><p>"We know it works in cancer cells, so now we're very confident about taking it to the next level," Mascharak said. "The idea for cancer therapy would be to embed the compounds in a matrix that you can place in the treatment site, then shine light on it to produce a high concentration of nitric oxide."</p><p>In designing the ruthenium nitrosyls, Rose and Mascharak were inspired by natural bacterial enzymes called nitrile hydratases, which release nitric oxide as a by-product when activated by light. </p><p>"We borrowed the idea from nature," Mascharak said. "Our initial goal was to understand these very unusual enzymes. Every hint that nature embedded in the behavior and structure of the enzyme we employed in designing a drug that can deliver nitric oxide in a very site-specific and controlled way."</p><p>Rose, who earned his Ph.D. this year, has been working on the project since 2004. He began by replacing the iron atom in a synthetic model of the enzyme with a different metal, ruthenium. </p><p>"Iron complexes are good in nature because they are highly reactive, but if you're trying to make a drug you want something that's more stable," Rose said. "The ruthenium complexes are much more stable when dissolved in water."</p><p>The first ruthenium nitrosyls he made released nitric oxide only under ultraviolet light, so Rose spent several years developing ways to sensitize them to specific wavelengths of visible light that could be used in photodynamic therapy. He did this by attaching dye molecules, called chromophores, to the ruthenium complex.</p><p>To test the resulting compounds as potential drugs, the chemists teamed up with breast cancer researcher Lindsay Hinck, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. Hinck and postdoctoral researcher Rebecca Marlow worked with Rose to test the dye-sensitized ruthenium nitrosyls against breast cancer cells growing in tissue culture. </p><p>The unactivated compounds are fluorescent, which allowed the researchers to track them using a fluorescence microscope as the compounds were absorbed by the cancer cells. The release of nitric oxide after exposure to light quenched the fluorescence, and the cells showed signs of apoptosis within four to eight hours.</p><p>"That was probably the most exciting day of my grad school career, when I looked through the microscope and saw the fluorescent compounds in the cells," Rose said. </p><p>Rose used a commercially available dye initially, then synthesized new dyes so that he could customize their properties. "In the end, the whole molecule was built from scratch in our lab," he said. "That's the fun of synthetic chemistry: It's like building with Legos, but you get to make your own Legos, so it's even better."</p><p>Mascharak said he now plans to collaborate with medical researchers at UCLA to conduct additional tests of the compounds in a tumor model. Meanwhile, he and Rose have continued to investigate the unusual chemistry of nitrile hydratases. They have just published their findings in the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> (published online May 27, 2009). </p><p>"We have now clearly shown the mechanism for how the enzyme nitrile hydratase is photoregulated by nitric oxide. This process gave us the idea of making light-sensitive metal nitrosyls as antitumor drugs," Mascharak said.</p><p>This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bad738072704601a012ff88e39340"><name>3036</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC receives 'intent to register' statements from more than 3,500 students</title><summary>More than 3,500 prospective freshmen have made formal commitments to attend UC Santa Cruz this fall, based on systemwide data released June 16 by the University of California.</summary><author>Jim Burns, (831) 459-2495</author><keywords>undergraduate admissions, admission to UC Santa Cruz, Statements of Intent to Register, SIR, fall 2009</keywords><description>More than 3,500 prospective freshmen have made formal commitments to attend UC Santa Cruz this fall, based on systemwide data released June 16 by the University of California.</description><start-date>1245135600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC receives 'intent to...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3036</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3036</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338958642</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338958642</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More than 3,500 prospective freshmen have made formal commitments to attend UC Santa Cruz this fall, based on systemwide data released today (June 16, 2009) by the University of California.</p>

As of May 1, UCSC had received 3,523 Statements of Intent to Register (SIRs) from prospective freshmen expressing their intent to enroll. The actual number of enrolling freshmen will not be known until fall.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"We are very excited to welcome the Class of 2013 to the University of California, Santa Cruz, and we're very gratified by the strong interest they have shown in our campus," said Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The academic quality and diversity of this class is especially impressive."</p>
<p>At UCSC, the numbers in this year's freshman admissions cycle reflect the campus's increasing popularity, said Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management:</p>

<ul>
<li><u>Undergraduate applications to UCSC soar for second consecutive year</u>: In January, UC officials announce that-for the second year in a row-more than 32,000 prospective undergraduates applied to UC Santa Cruz. UCSC attracts 32,847 applications from high school seniors and transfer students during the university's "priority filing" period of November 1-30-a 12.7 percent increase the 29,140 undergraduate applications UCSC received just two years ago. "The interest we received from prospective undergraduates for next fall is on par with the very high threshold we established a year ago," Whittingham says. "Having sustained that level of interest is very gratifying."<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><u>UCSC's acceptance rate for freshmen drops 10 percent in one year</u>: Numbers released in April by UC's Office of the President indicate that UCSC provided offers of admission to 16,135 prospective freshmen-64 percent of the 25,341 California high-school seniors who applied. Last year, the campus admitted 74 percent of the California freshman applicants; two years ago, 83 percent. The declining "admit rate" is a reflection of the campus's increasing selectivity in freshman admission, Whittingham says. "Our admission rate has gone from 83 to 74 to 64 percent in just two years. In this time frame, no other UC campus has experienced this kind of increase in selectivity."</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>With the campus having received SIRs from 3,523 prospective freshmen for the upcoming fall quarter, Whittingham said two attributes stand out: The academic profile of the students increased, both in average GPA and test scores; and UCSC also continued to attract a higher percentage of students from unrepresented ethnic groups.</p>
<p>"The University of California is defined by the quality of its academic programs and by the access to that quality," Whittingham said, "so we are extremely pleased by the academic achievement and ethnic diversity of UCSC's incoming freshman class."</p>
<p>The average GPA for the incoming freshmen is 3.60, up from 3.52 a year ago. SAT scores also increased, from 1698 a year ago to 1718 for this fall's freshmen. "Those are solid one-year increases," Whittingham said.</p>
<p>The percentage of underrepresented students among the incoming freshman class also increased to 25.6 percent, up from last year's 23.9 percent. Just over 23 percent of the students are Asian American. "We are especially excited that over a third of our incoming freshman class are considered the first in their families to earn a college degree," Whittingham said.</p>
<p>One of six UC campuses with reduced enrollment targets for freshmen, UCSC was committed to enrolling fewer than 3,620 freshmen in the fall-a reduction of at least 335 from this past fall. "Given the budget uncertainties this year, it has been absolutely critical that we enroll fewer students," Whittingham said. "It's now clear that we will achieve that goal. In a year in which state support is especially unpredictable, this is a great relief to us."</p>
<p>UC today also released numbers of community college students who have been admitted to UC's nine general campuses. UCSC has admitted 3,584 transfer students from community colleges throughout California, an increase of more than 300 from the previous year. UCSC would like to enroll 950 transfer students this fall, 80 more than enrolled this past fall.</p>
<p>"Throughout UC, the system is trying to accommodate more students who are transfering from one of the state's community college campuses," Whittingham said.</p>

<p>The 2009 Excellence in Teaching, Undergraduate Academic Achievement and Mentoring Awards ceremony is a highlight of Student Achievement Week, an annual celebration that showcases the scholarly and creative activities of UCSC's undergraduate students. It is an opportunity to pay tribute to their success and to honor the commitment of the faculty who so successfully engage students in learning through discovery. This year's ceremony was held June 5 at the Music Recital Hall.</p>
<p>UCSC alumnus Loren Steck was on hand to present the Steck Family Award, honoring the year's best senior thesis. Presentation of the Deans' and Chancellor's Awards was made by the leaders of each academic division.</p>
<p>Awards and scholarships included:</p>
<p><strong>Steck Family Award.</strong> The Steck Family Award honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. Rion Parsons was chosen for his thesis, "Dense Stellar Systems as Birth Places for Short Gamma-ray Bursts." His faculty adviser is Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics. Parsons and Ramirez-Ruiz have also submitted a paper for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> on "Short gamma-ray bursts and their afterglow signatures in dense stellar systems."</p>
<p><strong>Deans' and Chancellor's Awards.</strong> These awards recognize outstanding achievements by undergraduate students. Ten Deans' Awards are awarded to students within each division (Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Social Sciences). Of those students, up to three in each division can be selected to receive a Chancellor's Award. Students as well as their mentors were recognized at the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship.</strong> Professor emeritus of biology at UCSC Kenneth Thimann and his wife, Ann (both now deceased), established this pledge of support to UCSC in recognition of future UCSC graduate science scholars. The scholarship award of $2,000 is intended for use in graduate studies.</p>
<p>The <strong>Excellence in Teaching Awards</strong> are given each spring to selected faculty who engage students through innovative course designs, special learning techniques and materials, and their own personal qualities as teachers and mentors. In selecting awardees, the committee considers nomination letters written by students, as well as statements submitted by the nominee and his or her department chair and/or divisional dean. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom. Presentation of the Teaching Awards was by Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>

As your Senate Chair, I want to provide some of the missing context that informs the request.</p><p>We are all surely aware that both UC and the state are in dire budgetary straits. Yet, state funding per student for the University of California has progressively declined for a number of years, so this year's cuts to UC could be viewed as the most severe manifestation of a long term pattern in funding for the state's research university.</p><p>But, in the context of the "reductions" and the request for expedited review, the inadequacy of our state support has long been recognized by the system-wide Senate, which has made serial recommendations on how UC could fundamentally change its budgetary models (see, for example, the recent Senate document on "<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/mcyudof.ucfuture.june09.pdf">Coordination of Budget Planning and UC's Future</a>"; the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/cuts.report.04.08.pdf">2008 "Cuts" Report of UCPB</a>, and the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/futures.report.0706.pdf">2006 "Futures" Report</a>).</p><p>These documents demonstrate that the current budget emergency reflects a chronic condition to which the UC has repeatedly failed to respond.  Such a systemic lack of consideration of marked changes to UC's overall funding models in the face of the ongoing decline in state support, that has led us to our getting a request on a 1-week time frame to opine on how we would like our take-home pay cut. Indeed, the Senate having played the role of the mythical Cassandra on such budgetary matters provides no solace unless we are shown that the "death-by-a-thousand-cuts (and the occasional big one)" budgetary philosophy that has been the signature of UC over much of the last decade is being fundamentally altered. I believe that it is ABSOLUTELY incumbent on the UC and its President to articulate our multi-year institutional strategy in the likely event of continuing draconian cuts to state funding.  Otherwise, next year (and very likely in following years, until the budget "turns around"), we will simply be informed that whatever "reductions" that were instituted this year will either be continued or increased. </p><p>CPB Chair Gillman has already pointed out possible shortcomings and inadequacies of these policies, and I will not reiterate these. I would simply note that the lack of certainty about impacts on retirement benefits is appalling--the usage of the recurrent phrase "unless redressed by Regental action" is meaningless without an assessment of the likelihood of such actions. Moreover, you will also note that two of the three plans involve "some challenges for implementation in the payroll systems." In short, we are presented with plans that are inadequately described, and two-thirds of which may not even be able to be fully implemented.</p><p>I will mention one other sore point for our local Senate. In AVC McQuitta and AVC Peterson's transmission letter, they state that "The Plan is being developed in conformity with the Draft Amended Standing Order 100.4, Duties of the President, and Draft Presidential Furlough/Salary Reduction Guidelines that were previously distributed for comment and which will also be presented for approval at the July 2009 meeting." For your information, the Senate at UCSC opposed this Draft Standing Order in the strongest possible terms (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2009/06/ucsc-response_sro-presidential-powers.pdf">see our letter</a>); other UC campus Senates and system-wide Senate committees found the draft Standing Order 100.4 that we saw to be somewhere between seriously and fatally flawed. But, it appears that the approval of Regents Standing Order 100.4, on Emergency Powers for the UC President, is being viewed as a fait accompli.</p><p>I hope these thoughts are of some assistance to you as you prepare your responses to the solicitation for comment.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Quentin Williams, Chair</p><p>UCSC Academic Senate</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Members, UCSC Academic Senate</audience><admin>Quentin Williams, Chair</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bc72b8072704601a012ff7d429863"><name>3050</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Academic Senate Committee on Planning and Budget's communication about furlough, salary reduction options</title><summary>Academic Senate Committee on Planning and Budget writes to UCSC senators about the proposed furlough and salary reduction.</summary><description>Academic Senate Committee on Planning and Budget writes to UCSC senators about the proposed furlough and salary reduction.</description><start-date>1245394800000</start-date><display-name>Academic Senate Committee on...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3050</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3050</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338965242</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338965242</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>June 19, 2009</p><p>Dear Colleagues,</p><p>We write in response to President Yudof's June 16 proposed options for achieving salary savings. The campuses are being asked to provide "expedited review" of the three options (salary reduction vs. furlough).</p><p>Given the timing and transmittal of this request, sent individually to all faculty and staff, so late in the year, with so little turn-around time, the Committee on Planning and Budget (CPB) has decided to identify the main issues we see as critical to the review of the proposal.</p><p>We strongly support a graduated or progressive application of any salary reduction.  The current proposed option one sets two levels of salary cut,  4% below $46,000, with the salaries above $46,000 cut at 8%.  Cutting the salaries of those who earn less than $46,000 by 4% is unconscionable. CPB recommends that a salary reduction plan be devised that achieves the desired total of $195M in savings, on a graduated basis from, for example, 4%, 8% and 10%.  Salaries below a designated level would not be cut, and then above that level, the graduated cuts of 4%, 8% and 10% would apply.  Salaries for Senior Management Group personnel would be subject to this cut, in addition to the 5% reduction announced earlier this month.</p><p>Any salary reduction plan must have in place explicit measures for mitigating the impacts on a) service credit; b) retirement benefits; and c) leave accrual.</p><p>Any salary reduction plan must have in place an explicit sunset clause that specifies not only the time of duration (as do all three options) but also that at the termination of the cut, salaries will revert to the pre-cut level, and salary increases due to merit and promotion will reflect the current pay scale.</p><p>Although the policy states that it will apply to all faculty whether paid by grant, contract, clinical income, or state funds, it is not clear whether or how the President can legally furlough those paid by NIH rather than the state of California.  CPB is also concerned about the moral, ethical and legal obligation that such external support implies to accomplish a certain amount of work within a certain period of time. The longer the furlough the greater impact on the period of the contract.  At some UC campuses, significant numbers of faculty are on soft money (i.e., NIH, NSF, and other federal grants or contracts) not state funds.  In addition, many ladder-rank FTE faculty generate portions of their salary from such grants, contracts, or clinical income.</p><p>CPB would have liked to lead a coordinated campus effort to respond, and this is the best second line of defense we could devise in the time allotted.  We hope that you will find our views helpful in understanding and responding to the salary-reduction proposal.  While we were asked to review this proposal, it is critical to note that the decision-making process itself has failed to lay out possible long term alternatives to salary reductions that might include reducing instruction or planning to reduce the UC's holdings via the sale of assets.  The absence of such major policy guidance from the UC leadership is deeply disturbing.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Committee on Planning and Budget</p><p>UCSC Academic Senate</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bc8668072704601a012fffb139db1"><name>3051</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of Executive Director, Student Health Services</title><keywords>MaryKnudtson</keywords><start-date>1245740400000</start-date><display-name>Appointment of Executive Director,...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3051</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3051</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338965557</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338965557</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After conducting a national search, the Division of Student Affairs is pleased to announce the appointment of Mary Knudtson as the new Executive Director of Student Health Services.

He was 87. </p><p>One of the world's most accomplished Indian classical musicians and raga composers, Khan was revered by jazz, classical, and pop musicians worldwide. </p><p>He performed for more than 8 million people, recorded nearly 100 albums, and received numerous awards and honors throughout his career--including a MacArthur Foundation "Genius" award, five Grammy nominations, and a prestigious National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. </p><p>Named a national treasure by the Indian government in 1989, Khan was instrumental in helping popularize North Indian Classical music in the West. In 1971, he performed at the renowned Concert for Bangladesh benefit alongside Ravi Shankhar, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and George Harrison. </p><p>A virtuoso of the 25-string sarod, Khan was first brought to the United States in 1955 at the invitation of violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who described him as "an absolute genius" and "the greatest musician in the world."</p><p>In 1999, Khan was named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UC Santa Cruz after the campus established a $250,000 Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Indian Music. Contributors to the endowment included Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Talat and Kamil Hasan, Sid and Anu Maitra, Arjun and Kiran Malhotra, and Shiv and Kiran Nadar.</p><p>At UC Santa Cruz, Khan presented concerts, master classes, and workshops, both on his own and with his associates. He also served as an adviser to the Arts Division in the development of courses and resources in Indian classical music, and helped facilitate bringing outstanding guest performers and teachers to the campus.</p><p>In 2000, the Hasans contributed an additional gift of $350,000 to establish the Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music at UC Santa Cruz, which provides ongoing annual support for the campus's programs in Indian arts. </p><p><b>Dard Neuman</b> has served as the UCSC endowed chair in Indian classical music since 2005. He offers the following words on the passing of Ali Akbar Khan: </p><p>"To refer to a tradition as classical is to concede a golden age to a distant past. Those of us who are lovers of Indian classical music have not had to make such a concession. The twentieth century has witnessed a pantheon of musical titans who will enter history as some of the finest musicians ever. </p><p>Ustad Ali Akbar sits on this pantheon as one of the greatest of the greats. I have heard musicians who were senior to him and from rival lineages refer to his musicality as unmatched and his contributions as unrivalled. To have such a maestro in our presence has been an historical privilege, a station that allowed us to revel in the ephemeral presence of musical making while knowing we were a part of history in the making. </p><p>Those of us in Northern California have had another privilege. In 1967, the great ustad (master and maestro) established the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael where students visited to learn from him as well as from other notable musicians who came to teach and perform there, developing the larger Bay Area into one of the more resonant communities of connoisseurs outside of India, expanding in the 1990s to the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p> </p><p>The University, led by Dean Edward Houghton of the Arts Division and Professors Fred Lieberman and Linda-Burman Hall in the Department of Music, cultivated a relationship with Khansahib (sir Khan) that led to his being named, in 1999, Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UCSC, which paved the road to two of the very first endowments of their kind in the United States, the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment and the Hasan Endowed Chair of Classical Indian Music.</p><p> </p><p>Indian classical music is an oral tradition and so the passing of our ustads has a particular sting-we associate their art forms less with compositions, which have the potential for inscribed legacy, and more with live performances. But the cycle of loss and renewal has revolved for countless generations; an ustad is not just a maestro performer but a master teacher and in that respect Ustad Ali Akbar Khan was prolific-he nurtured numerous students into maestros who will carry forth his heritage as well as the repertoire of his lineage, known as the Maihar Gharana. </p><p>His eldest son, Ustad Aashish Khan, is one of the senior musicians today and has been teaching workshops during the spring quarters at UC Santa Cruz for the past several years.</p><p>Ustad Ali Akbar Khan is no longer with us, but his legacy will continue into the distant future. Through his students, his school, the endowment named after him at UCSC, his recordings, and the pinnacle of musical achievement that was his, the music that was Ustad Ali Akbar Khan's will enrich us for generations."</p><p>-Dard Neuman</p><p>Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music</p><p>UC Santa Cruz</p><p>							</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bcb698072704601a012ffc8e23560"><name>3053</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor Blumenthal, Campus Provost Kliger provide update on UC, campus budget</title><summary>UCSC Chancellor Blumenthal, Campus Provost Kliger provide update on UC, campus budget.</summary><description>UCSC Chancellor Blumenthal, Campus Provost Kliger provide update on UC, campus budget.</description><start-date>1245740400000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor Blumenthal, Campus Provost...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3053</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3053</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338966323</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338966323</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>These are sobering economic times, and UC Santa Cruz - like organizations throughout our state and nation - faces many difficult challenges.  Last week, we received more information on immediate and longer-term budget reductions that our campus will be required to make - up to $28.7 million to account for reduced state funding and mandatory cost increases.</p><p>But for student fee increases already approved in May, these cuts would be even greater. If the <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/news/general/0906-reduction_info.pdf">salary reductions or furloughs</a> proposed by the Office of the President last week are approved by the Regents, our 2009-2010 budget reduction will be lessened by an estimated $12.5 million - still requiring us to make additional cuts totaling slightly more than $16 million.</p><p>This is still a staggering amount, on top of $13 million in cuts already assigned for fiscal year 2009-10 and $10 million in one-time and permanent cuts made in FY 2008-09.  It amounts to an approximately 20 percent cut over two years to the state-funded portion of the UCSC budget. </p><p>The magnitude of the cuts we as a campus must make requires that we think and act differently.  Clearly, making these cuts will be a painful process and will require elimination and consolidation of programs, reductions in services, and an additional loss of personnel. We know the difficulty that layoffs will pose to some members of our campus community and their families, but additional layoffs seem unavoidable.</p><p>As of now, the Regents' decision to restart contributions to our retirement system beginning April 15, 2010 remains in effect, subject to collective bargaining with represented employees. Initially, there would be no impact on the net take-home pay of employees since the mandatory 2 percent contribution that most employees make to a defined contribution plan will be redirected to the UC Retirement Plan. </p><p>We are taking immediate steps to deal with this crisis.  Campus senior management, Academic Senate leaders, and student representatives are discussing the magnitude of the budget shortfall and the cuts required. We are working to accumulate information, questions, and ideas for immediate short-term reductions that must be made while also actively weighing options for determining the ongoing permanent cuts.</p><p>The unprecedented nature of our fiscal challenges, and the very real chance that we will continue to see state support decline further, requires ever-greater flexibility, innovation and collaboration. We must make difficult yet strategic decisions about our future - what we want UCSC to be.</p><p>Some things - including the inevitability of the cuts we're now facing - are out of our hands as a campus community. Yet we can, and will, make decisions and take actions that enable us to continue to deliver the quality education and research that is our mission. This will require determination, vision, ingenuity, and, yes, additional sacrifice by us all.  We thank you, sincerely, for your continued dedication and commitment.</p><p>We will share what we know when we know it and will update you regularly on our budget planning efforts as they take shape.

<p>How does a peanut butter and pepper-bacon sandwich sound? Or day-old spaghetti fried up with Swiss cheese?</p>
<p>Madison, founding chef of Greens restaurant and author of several cookbooks, and her husband, Patrick McFarlin, queried fellow foodies, farmers, friends, and strangers to compile <a href="%20http://www.deborahmadison.com/">What We Eat When We Eat Alone: Stories and 100 Recipes</a>, a 272-page exploration of culinary secrets.</p>
<p>Madison, who lives near Santa Fe, New Mexico, was interviewed by the <a href="%20http://www.sacbee.com/livinghere/story/1951809.html"><em>Sacramento Bee</em></a> during a recent visit to Northern California.</p>
<p>"I don't really see this as a cookbook," Madison told the Bee. "Yes, there are recipes, but they're not driving the book. It's about people."</p>
<p>Described by one reviewer as a "genuinely subversive book," <em>What We Eat When We Eat Alone</em> is the result of a query McFarlin began posing to friends years ago. A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQEIrU_Fr-M">YouTube</a> video captures some "confessions."</p>
<p>Madison's previous books include <em>The Greens Cookbook</em>, <em>The Savory Way</em>, and <em>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</em>, which received awards from the International Association of Culinary Professionals and the James Beard Foundation.

She traveled by herself all over Ghana and neighboring countries, took art history and archeology classes at the University of Ghana, and spent a week in Paris on her way home to visit the Louvre and other world-famous museums. </p><p>"It was amazing," said the senior art major, 20, who goes by the nickname Chai. "I kept thinking about where I'd be now, where I'd be in Santa Cruz, and thinking I'd never have the opportunity to do this."</p><p>The cost for Chang's six-month program was mostly covered by a <a href="http://www.iie.org//Content/NavigationMenu/Programs7/Gilman_Awards/Home8/Home.htm">Gilman Scholarship</a>, an award established by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000 and sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. The Gilman Scholarship offers grants to undergraduate students of limited financial means to pursue academic studies abroad. Each recipient receives up to $5,000 to fund their study abroad program.</p><p>Last year, UC Santa Cruz became one of the top five universities in the country in awarding students for the highly selective scholarship.</p><p>A growing number of UCSC students are applying for and receiving the award, said Shanté Lewis, <a href="http://eap.ucop.edu/">Education Abroad Program</a> (EAP) adviser in UCSC's <a href="http://oie.ucsc.edu">Office of International Education</a>. </p><p>Given the state of the economy, financing the Education Abroad Program has become an increasing concern for EAP applicants, she said. So her office increased its outreach to financially needy students. Last year, after sending targeted emails, the office noticed a boost in the number of students who received the Gilman Scholarship. </p><p>"A lot of the Education Abroad Program students will tell you that if not for the Gilman Scholarship, they would not be able to fund their study abroad program," said Lewis, a UCSC alumna (Cowell '06) who herself went abroad to Brazil and Ghana with Gilman Scholarships. "It's great to know these resources are out there, and that students are becoming aware of them through our office."</p><p>In 2008-09, nine UCSC students went abroad with a Gilman Scholarship. That year, the scholarship received 3,123 applications; 1,226 students were given awards, for a selection rate of 39 percent. </p><p>For fall 2009, 14 UCSC students have won Gilman Scholarships. In total, UCSC sends approximately 500 students abroad annually, according to Lewis. </p><p>As state budget cuts and resulting fee hikes continue to increase financial pressure on UC students and their families, awards such as the Gilman are more important than ever, said Lewis. </p><p>"Students are questioning whether they can afford the cost of a study abroad program," Lewis said. "That's one of the main myths--that it will be too expensive." </p><p>Senior Jacqueline Caraves, 20, a Latin American and Latino studies and politics major who studied abroad in fall 2008 in Chile, hears friends and fellow students dismiss the idea of studying abroad because they perceive it as being out of reach. </p><p>"I know a lot of people don't do it because they think they can't afford it, and with funding being cut, those opportunities are getting even slimmer," Caraves said. "It's really important to open that up for students from low-income backgrounds."</p><p>Studying in Chile was "the best experience I've ever had," she said. </p><p>"Especially people who don't usually have the opportunity to get out of their comfort zone or the space they're in, it's a really eye-opening experience, academically, emotionally, personally--in every sense it can be, it is," Caraves said. "It's a way to really grow and really learn about yourself, learn about everything around you, where you come from, where others come from."</p><p>Caraves took an intensive language program and political science courses in Chilean capital of Santiago, traveled, and served an internship at a medicinal center run by the Mapuche indigenous people. </p><p>The experience "opened me up and pushed me in the right direction," said Caraves. "I came back here and had more insight as to where I want to go as far as politics, my own place in society, and what I can do to change things." </p><p>Both Chang and Caraves said they would still have gone abroad, somehow, if they hadn't won the Gilman. But they agreed that the experience would have been lessened because they wouldn't have been able to sustain themselves as long.  </p><p>For Lewis, seeing others get the opportunity to study in another country is gratifying. </p><p>"It's so important for students, both professionally and academically," she said. "Students taking classes in another country become global citizens. So many of them come back saying they have gained respect for other cultures and communities."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bd35c8072704601a012ffcb93715c"><name>3058</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor Blumenthal shares budget video message from UC President Yudof</title><summary>In a video for the UC community, President Yudof asks for continued feedback on furlough/salary reduction options.</summary><description>In a video for the UC community, President Yudof asks for continued feedback on furlough/salary reduction options.</description><start-date>1246258800000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor Blumenthal shares budget...</display-name><path>/2009/06/3058</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/06/3058</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338968347</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338968347</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Colleagues, </p><p>Following up on his <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/news/general/0906-reduction_info.pdf">recent letter</a> about proposed furloughs/salary reductions, President Yudof has posted a video letter to all UC faculty and staff.

The optical trap is the latest innovation from researchers at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who are developing new sensor technology for biomedical analysis and other applications.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, it could have applications for rapid detection of bacteria and viruses in hospitals, for cell sorting in research labs, and for process monitoring in chemical engineering," said Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical engineering and director of the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics at UCSC.</p>
<p>The new technique offers the potential to create a smaller, cheaper version of the sophisticated equipment used to perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), Schmidt said.</p>
<p>"The capabilities of our optofluidic platform are continuing to grow. We have gone from the detection of single molecules and single viruses to now being able to control the movement of particles," he said.</p>
<p>Schmidt's group has received a $400,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to explore particle trapping and sorting and other applications of the optofluidics platform. An article describing the optical trap for on-chip particle analysis has been published online by the journal <em>Lab on a Chip.</em> First author Sergei Kuhn was a postdoctoral researcher in Schmidt's lab and is now at the Max-Born Institute in Berlin. Coauthors include David Deamer and Philip Measor at UCSC and E. J. Lunt, B. S. Phillips, and A. R. Hawkins of Brigham Young University, where the optofluidic chips are fabricated.</p>
<p>Optical traps and "optical tweezers" use the momentum carried by the photons in a beam of light to exert forces on microscopic objects, enabling researchers to manipulate objects ranging from biological molecules to living cells. Schmidt's group developed a new way to perform optical trapping on a chip-based platform.</p>
<p>The technique relies on an earlier innovation from Schmidt's lab: a hollow-core optical waveguide that can direct a beam of light through a liquid-filled channel on a chip. To trap particles, the researchers used two laser beams at opposite ends of a channel. A particle gets trapped at the point where the forces exerted by the two beams are equal, and the particle can be moved by changing the relative power of the two laser beams.</p>
<p>"We can also use this like an optical leaf blower to push all the particles in a sample to the same spot and increase the concentration," Schmidt said. "The goal is to control the position and movement of particles through channels on a chip so they can be studied using fluorescence analysis and other optical methods."</p>
