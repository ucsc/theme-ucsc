Sixty-seven percent of respondents to that survey support the death penalty, the Field Poll found. </p><p>But Haney's survey provides the first detailed picture of Californians' attitudes about the death penalty in 20 years. A follow-up to a nearly identical statewide survey Haney conducted in 1989, the new study identifies some of the factors that might help to explain declining support.</p><p>"What's significant about the recent decline is that it occurred primarily among the strongest supporters of the death penalty," said Haney, a leading scholar on capital punishment and author of the book <i>Death by Design</i>. </p><p>The proportion of adult Californians who view themselves as "strong" supporters of the death penalty has dropped from 50 percent in 1989 to 38 percent today. Conversely, fewer than 9 percent were "strongly opposed" to capital punishment 20 years ago, compared to 21 percent today.</p><p>"These changes appear to be related to changes in the way Californians view the system of death sentencing, rather than just the punishment itself," said Haney.</p><p>For example, the poll revealed much greater concern about the possibility of executing innocent people: 44 percent expressed concern this year, compared to only 23 percent in 1989. In addition, the number of respondents who believe the death penalty is a deterrent to murder dropped from 74 percent in 1989 to only 44 percent today. Similarly, the number of people who did not believe that prisoners sentenced to life without parole would actually stay in prison until they died dropped to about 40 percent, compared to 66 percent who held that belief in 1989.</p><p>"There is a higher level of accurate understanding today that life in prison without the possibility of parole is the real alternative to the death penalty under California law," said Haney, noting that no prisoner under that sentence has ever been paroled or pardoned in California.</p><p>Although Californians are somewhat more knowledgeable about the death penalty today than they were 20 years ago, some misconceptions persist. For example, Haney found that nearly half the respondents in the 2009 survey, compared to 54 percent in 1989, thought the death penalty is cheaper to implement than life without parole, although the reverse is true. </p><p>The new survey, which queried 800 jury-eligible Californians in February and March, also offered respondents an alternative to the death penalty--a sentence that guaranteed a prisoner would spend the rest of his or her life in prison and be required to work to pay restitution to the victim's family. With this alternative, support for the death penalty plunged to only 26 percent said Haney. Even when work and restitution were removed, 55 percent still preferred the alternative of life in prison without parole, compared to 37 percent who preferred capital punishment (and 8 percent who said they weren't sure). The survey also revealed that 64 percent of respondents oppose sentencing severely mentally ill individuals to death, an issue that is currently being litigated in a number of courts around the country.</p><p>The survey also asked about which factors would sway a potential juror's verdict toward life without parole or death. Among the factors that would lead them to vote for a life without parole sentence, according to the survey, were if the defendant had been seriously abused as a child, was intellectually or emotionally impaired at the time of the crime, or would make a positive adjustment and contributions in prison. Likewise, people were more likely to vote for the death penalty in a given case when the crime involved torture, there were multiple victims, or occurred during a sexual assault.</p><p>Haney said the 2009 survey, which had a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percent, was an almost exact replica of the one done in 1989. "Public opinion data are important," said Haney, "It's useful to know whether and how statewide attitudes have changed on these issues." Together the two surveys form the most detailed statewide study of public opinion ever done on the death penalty in the state. "Californians appear to be changing their attitudes on capital punishment in step with national trends," he added.</p><p>The new study was funded by the National Jury Project; the poll was conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Virginia.</p><p>####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Haney can be reached at (831) 459-2153 or via e-mail at psylaw@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c90ce8072704601a012ff382a4a8e"><name>3170</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tracy Larrabee appointed Associate Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives</title><keywords>Silicon Valley Initiatives, Tracy Larrabee, University Affiliated Research Center, Advanced Studies Laboratory, Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute, UARC, ASL, Bin Ridi</keywords><start-date>1251874800000</start-date><display-name>Tracy Larrabee appointed Associate...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3170</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3170</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339016867</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339016867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am delighted to announce that Tracy Larrabee, professor of computer engineering, has accepted the position of Associate Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives on a 50 percent basis.</p><p>Among other duties, Professor Larrabee will be the academic point of contact for UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiatives and will oversee the University Affiliated Research Center and the Advanced Studies Laboratory, including the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute.

It has been used by University of California astronomers for pioneering research on everything from quasars to extrasolar planets, as well as for the development of cutting-edge technologies such as adaptive optics, now used to sharpen the vision of telescopes around the world.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Shane Telescope on Saturday, September 26. Tickets are still available for the event, which includes a strolling dinner; a lecture on extrasolar planets by UC Berkeley astronomer Geoffrey Marcy; tours of the observatory; and (weather permitting) viewing with the telescopes. For details and reservations, visit the Lick Observatory <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/shane_event.html">web site</a> or call (831) 459-5003.</p>
<p>The Shane Telescope, completed in 1959, was named for Donald Shane, who was director of the observatory during the telescope's design and construction. With its 3-meter (120-inch) primary mirror, it was the second largest telescope in the world for 16 years. Although no longer among the largest telescopes in the world, it is still heavily used by UC astronomers and continues to yield important scientific discoveries.</p>
<p>A major upgrade of the telescope's adaptive optics capabilities is currently under way, thanks to a $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to adaptive optics researchers at UC Santa Cruz. Demand for time on the 3-meter telescope is already high and is expected to increase, said Michael Bolte, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and director of UC Observatories (UCO).</p>
<p>Recent examples of major science programs involving the Shane Telescope include the discovery of planets orbiting other stars and the use of supernovae to measure the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>"The majority of the first 100 extrasolar planets were discovered based on observations with the Shane Telescope," Bolte said. "And the combination of two telescopes at Mt. Hamilton, the Shane and the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, has proven to be extraordinarily powerful for discovering and characterizing supernovae throughout the nearby universe. This work, led by Alex Filippenko at UC Berkeley, is the basis for using supernovae to map the expansion history of the universe, leading to the discovery of dark energy."</p>
<p>Much of the early research with the Shane had to do with understanding quasars and identifying the source of their enormous energy as the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Another major effort over many years involved the characterization of galaxies throughout the local universe. Led by Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, these studies established what are today standard techniques for measuring the properties of galaxies and provided the basis for comparisons with more distant galaxies.</p>
<p>The Shane Telescope has also served as the proving ground for several important advances in technology related to astronomy. The switch from photographic plates to early electronic detectors, and ultimately to the CCD cameras that are now standard for astronomy, was pioneered at the Shane Telescope. And the Shane played a key role in bringing adaptive optics (AO) technology to astronomy, enabling ground-based telescopes to overcome the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Shane Telescope was one of the earliest to experiment with adaptive optics for astronomy. With the addition of a laser beacon in 2003, it became the first telescope with a laser guide-star AO system in use for regular astronomical observing. The laser creates an "artificial star" in the sky to serve as a reference point for the AO system, which measures distortions in the image and then uses a deformable mirror to apply corrections hundreds of times per second.</p>
<p>The current AO system at Mt. Hamilton was developed in the early 1990s by a team led by Claire Max, then at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and now director of the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. Max also led the development of the laser guide-star and other components of the AO system for the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>With the new NSF grant, researchers will replace key components of the Shane's AO system, now more than 10 years old, with state-of-the-art technology. The original deformable mirror--a hand-assembled glass mirror with transducers glued to the back to adjust its shape--will be replaced with a more advanced mirror based on MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology.</p>
<p>"The deformable mirror is the heart of the adaptive optics system, and the MEMS mirror lets the system correct the images to a much finer degree than the old one," said Don Gavel, director of UCSC's Laboratory for Adaptive Optics (LAO) and principal investigator on the NSF grant.</p>
<p>Gavel, Max, and other LAO and CfAO researchers have been working with MEMS manufacturers to perfect a device design that is suitable for use in astronomy. The NSF grant will also fund a new infrared science camera with a larger area and more sensitive detectors, as well as a planned upgrade for the laser system.</p>
<p>"With the newer system, scientists will be able to use the AO system for observations over a much broader range of infrared wavelengths," Gavel said. "It injects new life into the system and opens it up to a large array of new science projects."</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating the Shane Telescope's 50th anniversary, the September 26 event at Mt. Hamilton also marks the 400th anniversary of the first use of an astronomical telescope (by Galileo Galilei in 1609) and will highlight the completion of the newest telescope at Lick Observatory, the Automated Planet Finder. The event will include the inaugural presentation of the James Lick Award, established to honor individuals or organizations that have significantly advanced the mission of Lick Observatory.</p>

<p>The UCSC Genome Sequencing Center features state-of-the-art equipment, including the GS FLX Titanium Series sequencing platform from 454 Life Sciences and the SOLiD sequencing platform from Applied Biosystems. The center expects to add new platforms in the near future, said director Nader Pourmand, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p>
<p>"It is a high-end facility, and our technical staff is trained to perform initial quality control, sample preparation, and sequencing for a variety of applications," Pourmand said.</p>
<p>Applications include whole-genome and targeted sequencing; resequencing; RNA sequencing; micro-RNA and small-RNA sequencing; chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (to identify binding sites of DNA-associated proteins); and metagenomics (also called environmental genomics, involving the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples).</p>
<p>Pourmand's research laboratory focuses on developing new techniques and assays for biomedical applications. His research team is available to work with individual researchers to design and develop new assays if current standard protocols will not meet their needs.</p>
<p>Key funding for the UCSC Genome Sequencing Center was provided by the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), a multidisciplinary research institute involving more than 200 scientists at UCSF, UC Berkeley, and UCSC.</p>

The researchers identified a novel structural element in an HIV coat protein that could be useful for vaccine development. </p><p>Despite major efforts over the past 20 years to develop an AIDS vaccine, none of the vaccines tested in clinical trials has succeeded in preventing HIV infections. Berman oversaw one of those trials as head of research and development at VaxGen. Now he has gone "back to the drawing board" to take a new approach to AIDS vaccine development. </p><p>The focus of the research is on antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a wide range of HIV strains. Such "broadly neutralizing antibodies" are necessary to stop the virus because HIV is extremely variable, constantly evolving to evade the immune systems of infected individuals. </p><p>"One of the main hypotheses in HIV vaccine research is that if a vaccine could induce those broadly neutralizing antibodies, it would work. None of the current vaccines do that," Berman said.</p><p>Our immune systems are capable of making broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV, but studies have found that this happens in fewer than 25 percent of infected individuals and not until six to 12 months after infection. By then, it's too late to stop the virus. "The antibodies have to be there before infection occurs. After the virus gets a foothold, it's too late," Berman said. </p><p>Berman's lab, along with collaborators at Monogram Biosciences of South San Francisco, developed a new method called "swarm analysis" to investigate the natural variations in the virus that emerge in the early stages of HIV infections. The studies reported in the <i>Journal of Virology</i> paper were led by first author Sara O'Rourke, a research specialist in biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p><p>"We've made use of the natural variation in viral gene sequences to identify the binding sites recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies," Berman said. "By looking at viruses from very early infections, we're seeing variations that hadn't been seen before."</p><p>One of those variations appears to change the shape of an HIV coat protein in such a way that it becomes more sensitive to neutralization by antibodies. Working with William Scott, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, Berman's lab analyzed the effects of this genetic variant on the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The results indicate that the structural change exposes parts of the protein that are normally hidden from the immune system and are only exposed transiently during the infection process, when the viral membrane fuses with the membrane of a human cell. </p><p>In the <i>Journal of Virology</i> paper, the authors suggest that this novel structural variant could be exploited in designing new vaccines.</p><p>"We think that by making a vaccine based on this structure where the binding sites are exposed, it will stimulate a broadly neutralizing antibody response," Berman said. "By having the protein in a different conformation, the immune system can see those binding sites and make antibodies that would then be effective against normal virus strains during that transient window when the sites are exposed."</p><p>Studies are currently under way to examine the immunogenic potential of the variants identified in the study. </p><p>Meanwhile, the vaccine that Berman invented at Genentech in the mid-1990s, then evaluated in clinical trials at VaxGen, has been tested in a more recent clinical trial (RV 144) sponsored by U.S. and Thai government agencies. The manufacturing and intellectual property rights for the vaccine are now held by Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (GSID). Results of the trial, which concluded earlier this year, are expected to be announced in October at the <a href="http://www.hivvaccineenterprise.org/conference/2009/index.aspx">AIDS Vaccine 2009</a> international conference in Paris. The clinical trial tested a "prime-boost" vaccine regimen, in which a vaccine developed by Aventis Pasteur was used as a "priming" vaccine, followed by the GSID vaccine as a "booster." The community-based clinical trial involved 16,000 volunteers in southeast Thailand.</p><p>Berman said the research funded by the new grant will complement the data from the RV 144 trial. Using the "swarm analysis" technique and the bioinformatics and genomics expertise of his UCSC colleagues, Berman's group will be studying the evolution of the virus and the host's immune response during the early stages of HIV infection. Blood serum samples collected during earlier VaxGen clinical trials involving intravenous drug users are a crucial resource for these studies.</p><p>"It's a lemons to lemonade kind of thing, building on information from a failed vaccine trial to move the field forward in a different way," Berman said.</p><p>In addition to O'Rourke, Berman, and Scott, the coauthors of the <i>Journal of Virology</i> paper include Becky Schweighardt and Terri Wrin of Monogram Biosciences, Dora Fonseca of UCSC, and Faruk Sinangil of GSID. GSID is a nonprofit organization based in South San Francisco that focuses on vaccines for the developing world. The study was supported by a grant to GSID from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and funding provided by UCSC.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ca18f8072704601a012ffe7c7d5ed"><name>3181</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Blumenthal takes part in group envisioning UC's future</title><summary>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal is co-chair of the Size and Shape of UC committee, one of the working groups established under the UC Commission on the Future.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Blumenthal, Size and Shape of UC, UC Commission on the Future, Russell Gould</keywords><description>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal is co-chair of the Size and Shape of UC committee, one of the working groups established under the UC Commission on the Future.</description><start-date>1252566000000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal takes part in...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3181</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3181</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339021146</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339021146</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal is co-chair of the Size and Shape of UC committee, one of the working groups established under Regents Chairman Russell Gould's <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC Commission on the Future</a>.</p>

Toklas in Paris during the 1920s and 30s. </p><p>Her first novel, it received the 2003 Bard Fiction Prize, the Stonewall Book Award-Gittings Literature Award, and the Young Lions Fiction Award.</p><p>UCSC history professor Dana Frank, director of the UCSC Center for Labor Studies, noted the significance of Truong's book and the author's upcoming appearance on campus.</p><p>"Monique Truong's pathbreaking novel <i>The Book of Salt</i> highlights the invisible labor behind the public work of intellectuals," said Frank. "The novel investigates the private lives of those who cook, clean, and provide emotional support, making possible the creativity and fame of famous writers." </p><p>"In the United States, these workers are usually women and people of color," she added. "Yet their labors usually disappear from our stories of literary history." </p><p>Frank noted that Truong's UCSC appearance is also part of the Literature Department's Asian American Literary Series this fall. That series includes an appearance by famed author Maxine Hong Kingston on campus, November 18. </p><p>"Truong is a pioneering Vietnamese American novelist," said Frank. "In inviting her, we are pleased to be acknowledging the Vietnamese community in the Bay Area, as well as supporting Asian American Studies at UCSC."</p><p>Born in Saigon in 1968, Truong moved to the United States at the age of six, and went on to graduate from Yale University and the Columbia University School of Law. </p><p> </p><p>Trong is the author of numerous essays and works of short fiction, and her new book, <i>Bitter in the Mouth</i>, will be published by Random House in 2010. She is also co-editor of the anthology <i>Watermark: Vietnamese American Poetry and Prose</i>, and her essay "Welcome to America" has been featured on National Public Radio.</p><p>The UCSC Center for Labor Studies is funded by the Miguel Contreras Labor Fund of the University of California Office of the President, and co-sponsored by the UCSC Division of Humanities. </p><p>The Living Writers Reading Series is hosted by the Creative Writing Program of the UCSC Literature Department.

In 2007, a major <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1537">gift</a> from the Gloria and Kenneth Levy Foundation helped fund the world-class spectrometer that is central to the APF's mission.</p><p>Kenneth Levy built his career around a pioneering Silicon Valley firm, KLA (now KLA-Tencor), that he founded in the 1970s. He was the firm's CEO for more than 20 years and served as chairman of the board from 1999 until he retired in 2006. He and his wife, Gloria, are involved in philanthropy through their foundation.</p><p>The Levys will receive the inaugural James Lick Award at a special evening <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/shane_event.html">event</a> on Saturday, September 26, when Lick Observatory will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 3-meter Shane Telescope and the 400th anniversary of the first use of a telescope for astronomy. The award was established to honor individuals or organizations that have significantly advanced the mission of Lick Observatory.</p><p>"We greatly appreciate the Levys' support, which came at a crucial time to make the APF a reality," said Michael Bolte, director of UC Observatories (UCO) and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "The discovery of planets orbiting other stars a little more than a decade ago ushered in a new field of science. Work at the Lick Observatory 3-meter telescope has been crucial to establishing this new field, and the APF will ensure that the University of California remains at the forefront in this area."</p><p>The APF telescope, with its 2.4-meter (94-inch) mirror, was installed in a new dome on Mt. Hamilton over the summer. It will be fully automated and equipped with a spectrometer optimized for a planet-detection technique that relies on precision measurements of starlight. The spectrometer, which is nearing completion in the UCO shops, was designed by Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p><p>"We should have it installed on the telescope and operational by the end of the year," Vogt said. "The APF will be the largest telescope fully dedicated to finding planets orbiting other stars."</p><p>The spectrometer enables astronomers to detect the tiny wobble induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. Vogt's past designs include the two most successful planet-finding spectrometers in operation today--the high-resolution "HIRES" spectrometer, mounted on the 10-meter Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Hamilton spectrometer on the Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.</p><p>In addition to Vogt, the collaborators on the APF project include astronomers Geoffrey Marcy of UC Berkeley and Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University. Major funding for the APF telescope and dome was provided by a grant from the U.S. Naval Observatory, with additional contributions from project collaborators. Funding for the spectrometer was provided by NASA, the Levys, and project collaborators. </p><p>The event at Lick Observatory on September 26 will raise funds to support the completion and operation of the APF. Tickets are still available for the event, which includes a strolling dinner; a lecture by planet hunter Geoffrey Marcy; tours of the observatory; and (weather permitting) viewing with the telescopes.

<p><strong>Chancellor George Blumenthal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presentation to UC Board of Regents</strong></p>
<p><strong>Committee on Educational Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>UCSF Mission Bay Campus</strong></p>
<p><strong>September 16, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Two months ago, you heard me describe - in fairly bleak terms - the harm that declining state support is imposing, and will continue to impose, on UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Today, I want to share the rest of the story.</p>
<p>The story of a young, vibrant campus continuing its ascent within the prism of tough economic realities.</p>
<p>The story of a dynamic research university uncommonly able to equip students for lives of purpose.</p>
<p>You'll hear about some of our strengths. About steps we have taken, and are taking, to invest in people and programs with the greatest impact.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let's start with location.</p>
<p>As some of you know, we're in college-ranking season. The Newsweek/Kaplan 2009 College Guide describes our campus as a place "For Overachievers Who Need to Stop and Look Around."</p>
<p>When our students do stop to look around, they see a campus nestled amid 2,000 acres of redwoods. Vistas that overlook the Santa Cruz Mountains. The nearby Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Our location has also influenced the focus and reach of a world-renowned research portfolio.</p>
<p>Our Marine Sciences campus overlooks the Pacific Ocean - the world's largest marine laboratory. In a single location, UC Santa Cruz brings together a modern marine field station, the Long Marine Research Lab, a public outreach center, and many other assets of a world-class research university.</p>
<p>Our proximity to Silicon Valley spawned a multi-faceted $330 million research agreement with NASA, the largest competitive research contract ever awarded by that federal agency to a research university.</p>
<p>With Foothill-DeAnza Community College and other academic institutions, we are advancing plans - approved by the Regents - to develop a research park at NASA/Ames. It will include multiple academic programs. A sustainable living community. And collaborative research involving academic, industrial, and NASA scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>On behalf of the UC system, Santa Cruz astronomers and astrophysicists - my own academic colleagues - oversee Lick Observatory at Mount Hamilton. They ensure that Lick remains a state-of-the-art resource.</p>
<p>In addition to planning and research, our uncommon location has imbued UC Santa Cruz with a deep commitment to ecological and environmental action.</p>
<p>More than half of our 2,000-acre campus is preserved as natural habitat. All capital construction preserves tree lines and scenic vistas. Some have described campus buildings as having been "dropped in" among the trees. That's not literally true, of course, but it paints a picture.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club rates UC Santa Cruz among America's 10 most eco-enlightened universities. A prominent environmental publication rates our dining services the nation's greenest.</p>
<p>And, last year, we reached an accord with our local community on future growth. Our long-range plan is hailed as a model for town-gown relationships. It allows responsible growth while mitigating the impacts of growth.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In a moment I'll discuss our academic plan and what's at risk if the state continues to disinvest in UC. First, I want to offer a snapshot of our considerable research impact.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz researchers are already known as leaders in major disciplines. Biochemistry and molecular biology. Environmental studies. Geosciences. Astronomy and astrophysics. Literature. International economics.</p>
<p>By strategically hiring academic "rising stars," we've become strong in other areas, as well.</p>
<p>A legitimate measure of research impact is how frequently a university's research is cited in other's research. Based on citations per research paper, our campus ranks 4th in overall impact among non-medical school campuses.</p>
<p>And among public universities without medical schools, UC Santa Cruz ranks first using this measure of research impact.</p>
<p>Another measure is federal research funding. Compared to other major research institutions without medical schools, UC Santa Cruz ranks 9th in federal research dollars per faculty member.</p>
<p>We've attracted over $100 million in research grants annually for four straight years. Private research awards have risen 400% in 12 years. Indeed, three weeks ago, the Chronicle of Higher Education ranked Santa Cruz the fourth-biggest gainer in federal funds for academic research and development from 2000 to 2007.</p>
<p>Just this month, we broke ground on a new Biomedical Sciences center. It will house Santa Cruz health researchers, including those who have garnered over $19 million in stem cell research grants from the Center for Regenerative Medicine.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Our impact is matched by an uncommon commitment to involving undergraduates directly in research.</p>
<p>Nearly six in 10 Santa Cruz students assist faculty with research.</p>
<p>A great example is NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Launched in May 2008, it has the potential to answer some of science's most fundamental questions.</p>
<p>Its gamma-ray detecting system was developed at Santa Cruz. Nearly two-dozen undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs contributed to this effort, led by Professor Robert Johnson.</p>
<p>By working on important original research like this, our undergraduates help create knowledge while learning to appreciate its global impact.</p>
<hr/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was conceived as an uncommon research university where educational programs would not simply co-exist, but be enriched by the research environment.</p>
<p>Both our structure and our planning honor this vision.</p>
<p>We hire faculty who want to teach and conduct quality research. We continue to invest in 10 intimate Colleges - vibrant living and learning communities, each led by a Provost with a faculty appointment.</p>
<p>Each College offers a distinctive, interdisciplinary academic theme, co-curricular programs, academic advising and support. All first-year students take a "core course" within their College, exposing them to new ideas and closer relationships with faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>In sum, UC Santa Cruz students experience the intimacy of a small liberal arts college and the intellectual heft of a major research university.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I'm proud that our campus in many ways reflects the diversity of the state we serve. One-quarter of this year's frosh class is of Asian descent. Another quarter comprises under-represented ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz has the highest percentage of women among its faculty of any campus in the UC system.</p>
<p>Intimacy and diversity contribute to our students' success.</p>
<p>And they do succeed.</p>
<p>In 2007 - 08, Santa Cruz had eight Fulbright scholars out of 14 applicants. That's a remarkable success rate. By comparison, Princeton had eight winners that year as well - from a nominee pool four times larger.</p>
<p>Our graduates flock in unusual numbers to public service. This year, UC Santa Cruz ranked second in the nation among medium-sized universities for graduates serving in the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>And in a recent study of alumni who earn doctorates, Santa Cruz placed among the top 50 globally and second among UC's</p>
<p>Santa Cruz students are bright. Uncommonly motivated. And they leave us equipped to make the world a better place.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Santa Cruz students are also the face of California.</p>
<p>Many come from families of modest means. Over a quarter receive Pell grants. Most could not attend college without federal and state support.</p>
<p>More than a third of our frosh, and nearly four in 10 transfer students, are first in their families to attend college.</p>
<p>This is Irene Vasquez, a 2009 Santa Cruz graduate. Irene double-majored in environmental studies and economics. She hopes to pursue a career with the National Park Service -- partly to protect her native Miwok and Paiute tribes.</p>
<p>This is Sequilla Lee, another recent grad. She grew up in foster homes before coming to Santa Cruz. A sociology major, Sequilla plans to return to her southern California hometown to teach history and start a non-profit serving other foster youth.</p>
<p>We expect 3,200 new undergraduates to enroll this fall and in each of the next several years. That is 750 fewer than 2008, one of our largest classes ever. UC Santa Cruz enrolled hundreds of students last year for which we received no state funding.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz continues to grow more popular and increasingly selective. We would love to be able to admit additional students. But, please understand: Until the state reinvests in UC, our campus will have to close its doors to hundreds of qualified students like Irene and Sequilla.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let me now share six ways we are acting strategically to maintain momentum for our academic plan in this difficult climate.</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> Our Academic Senate last year adopted meaningful and practical enhancements to our general education requirements.</p>
<p>Every UC Santa Cruz undergraduate in every major - from engineering to economics, from music to microbiology - will complete a rigorous series of core courses across diverse disciplines.</p>
<p>By graduation, Santa Cruz students will demonstrate proficiency in ten skill areas. For example, one such skill area is statistical reasoning - a relevant skill for the 21st century, no matter what your career path.</p>
<p>All Santa Cruz students will also take at least one junior or senior level course in disciplinary communications. Each of our graduates will understand how to write and speak in a manner relevant to their chosen field of study.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> We are investing in graduate programs. Over the past 15 years, our campus has more than doubled its array of Ph.D. programs, as our doctoral degrees awarded also doubled. Because of the importance of these graduates to our state, I am committed to further growth in our graduate programs.</p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> We are being realists. To protect and strengthen other core academic programs, we've had to stop funding other promising initiatives, including a nascent center for global science policy. We are also taking a hard look at non-academic programs that serve our community and region well.</p>
<p>If I'm forced to choose between saving valuable non-academic community programs or preserving access for deserving students, I really have no choice at all.</p>
<p>So, we are enhancing our undergraduate curriculum. Expanding graduate education. And doing everything we can to protect core academic programs.</p>
<p><strong>The fourth step</strong> that we are taking is reevaluating our strategic academic plan that was distributed to all of you. Our plan is organized around six core themes.</p>
<p>All six were developed to leverage Santa Cruz academic and research strengths. They remain relevant today.</p>
<p>But this plan was developed when the economy was reasonably stable. Given the times, we are working to assure that our best programs remain strong while finding ways to invest in those others having great promise.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has always been innovative and agile. The genome browser was a byproduct of David Haussler's groundbreaking work on the human genome. As his work was progressing, we were developing what has become an internationally recognized Bioinformatics program.</p>
<p>Our Jack Baskin School of Engineering doesn't look like most engineering schools. For example, it offers no civil or mechanical engineering. Baskin's curriculum and research are instead focused in areas most relevant to our physical location near Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>These include renewable energy solutions, and our newest graduate program in information technology management, which will be based in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Recognizing a critical shortage of health professionals along California's central coast, UC Santa Cruz created a health sciences undergraduate major whose enrollment has become impacted in just a few years. Unlike traditional pre-professional programs, ours requires medical Spanish and a field internship.</p>
<p>Actually, I've visited clinics where Santa Cruz health science majors intern. Seeing them work, speaking with them, and hearing their enthusiasm has been an enlightening experience as this program addresses a major regional need.</p>
<p><strong>Our fifth strategic action</strong> is identifying and attracting faculty who bring passion and intellect, and who are committed to teaching and research.</p>
<p>Faculty are the core of a great university and I want you to meet just a few of them:</p>
<p>This is Professor Michael Mateas. An expert on computational media and computer game design, he recently was named the first holder of the MacArthur Foundation Chair at UCSC.</p>
<p>Michael is redefining the expressive power of "serious games." Like computer simulations that help train firefighters. And interactive programs that help psychologists better understand interpersonal dynamics.</p>
<p>Meet Nate Mackey, professor of literature, poet, literary critic, fiction writer, and journal editor. His accomplishments include a National Book Award for the book "Splay Anthem."</p>
<p>And meet Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and winner of a Women of Discovery Award. Terrie studies the phsyiology of marine mammals. If you're ever in Antarctica, you might visit "Terrie Bluff," overlooking a large penguin rookery. It was named for her, in 2006.</p>
<p>Next, Professor of Electrical Engineering Wentai Liu. He collaborated on an artificial retina that is now in clinical trials. Wentai's efforts have succeeded in restoring sight to the blind.</p>
<p>Next, meet David Yager, Dean of the Arts. In addition to his appointment at Santa Cruz, David holds a faculty appointment at Johns Hopkins. There, he is collaborating with research and clinical physicians on a visual sensory device that will help ameliorate pain during medical procedures.</p>
<p>And, meet Art Ramirez, Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. We plucked Dean Ramirez out of Bell Labs. He brings a true passion for using applied research to solve real-world problems. Art will be key to developing deeper partnerships in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Meet Carl Walsh, professor of economics, who delivered the principal paper on monetary policy at the recent Central Bankers meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Walsh's analysis of the Fed's interest rate policies attracted international focus.</p>
<p>Now, meet two of our younger academic stars.</p>
<p>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz is Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, a Packard fellow, and early career-development honoree from the National Science Foundation. Enrico is using proceeds from his NSF grant to increase college graduation rates among Hispanic youth in Salinas.</p>
<p>Next, anthropologist Nate Dominy, another Packard fellow. What makes Nate an especially good fit for Santa Cruz is his active commitment to working with undergraduates. Students who traveled with Nate to Costa Rica to study primates described the experience as life changing. Some are now pursuing PhD's of their own.</p>
<p>At the July Regents meeting, you heard from University Professor Sandra Faber, one of the world's most renowned astrophysicists and one of our campus's homegrown National Academy of Science members. Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Nate Dominy are among the "rising stars" Professor Faber spoke of -- faculty UC is at risk of losing without renewed state support.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, we've stepped up fund raising. Giving to UC Santa Cruz has risen 40 percent over the last three years. As state support declines, that trend must continue.</p>
<p>We've invested in infrastructure to support overall philanthropy, and are preparing for UCSC's first comprehensive campaign. We are protecting our investment in fundraising, even as we cut elsewhere.</p>
<p>The campaign for UCSC will broaden its reach and its global impact as the campus approaches its 50th year, in 2015.</p>
<p>UCSC is a major research university, generating big ideas and important breakthroughs. Our faculty understands not only how to transmit knowledge and hone skills, but how to ignite curiosity, inflame desire, and unleash genuine care.</p>
<p>They transform Santa Cruz students into alumni who want to transform the world and give back to our state and nation.</p>
<p>We are all understandably concerned by budget cuts and furloughs.</p>
<p>But I truly believe that 20 years from now, people will remember the progress achieved at Santa Cruz during this period much more clearly than the pain we shared.</p>
<p>A doubling of library capacity. New facilities for the Humanities, Digital Arts and Engineering. A biomedical research center for health and stem cell research.</p>
<p>Stellar new faculty. Curricular enhancements. New knowledge acquired through innovative research.</p>
<p>A campus strengthened and primed for future opportunities as resources grow again.</p>
<p>As you've seen today, UC Santa Cruz has made extraordinary progress. We are a campus on the move. Fulfilling our enormous potential and focused on defining the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915cb34d8072704601a012ff9c8480bb"><name>3192</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Center Closure on September 17, 2009 </title><start-date>1253084400000</start-date><display-name>Student Health Center Closure...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3192</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3192</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339025693</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339025693</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Student Health Center team welcomes you back to the new school year.

UCSC's three-quarter-average enrollment for the year, always lower than the fall-quarter enrollment, is projected to be 16,350.</p><p>In a year in which state support for higher education steeply declined and budgeted spaces on most of the UC system's campuses decreased, an estimated 3,250 freshman are projected to be UCSC students in the coming quarter. Expected among UCSC's 4,150 new undergraduate students are approximately 900 transfer students, most of whom are coming from California's community colleges.</p><p>Approximately 380 new graduate students are also expected, 70 more than enrolled this time a year ago. The new students are expected to bring the total number of UCSC graduate students to 1,570 - about 80 more than last fall.</p><p><b>Academic Preparation and Ethnic Diversity Increase:</b></p><p>While fewer in numbers than last fall's unexpectedly large freshman class (3,962), this fall's freshman are more academically prepared and ethnically diverse. The grade-point-average of the entering class is projected to be 3.61; last fall's entering freshmen entered with an average 3.54 GPA.</p><p>Nearly one-quarter of the class (24.7 percent) is comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been underrepresented within the UC system. The 24.7 percent is a jump from last fall's 22.1 percent. This fall's freshman class is also expected to comprise 22.9 percent students who are Asian American. Nearly 44 percent (43.9) of the students identified as White/Caucasian, and 8.6 percent declined to report an ethnicity.</p><p>"We're also very excited that more than one-third of our freshman class [36.9 percent] will be the first in their families to earn a four-year degree," says Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and director of admissions. The 36.9 percent compares with 33.8 percent a year ago. "All of our students and families are to be congratulated for their dedication and commitment to education."</p><p><b>UCSC People in the News:</b></p><p>The new academic year begins at UCSC on the heels of two new campus accolades:</p><p>. The campus is one of 25 profiled in the cover story of Newsweek magazine's fall 2009 special issue on U.S. colleges. The article describes UCSC as the place to go for "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3157">Overachievers Who Need to Stop and Look Around</a>."</p><p>. UC Santa Cruz has placed seventh in the Sierra Club magazine's third annual "honor roll" of the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3149">top 10 greenest colleges</a> in the nation.</p><p>"The quality of UCSC students and the magnificent beauty of our campus have long been recognized," Whittingham said. "But these two new honors really speak to the commitment of our students and their desire to make a difference in our world."</p><p><b>Construction Nearing Completion:</b></p><p>. Digital Arts Building: Work is ongoing, and the building is opening this fall. Located near the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center, the $25 million arts building is slated to house the expanding digital arts program as well as to provide 10 studios for art faculty, a photography studio, and expanded space for music and theater arts classes.</p><p>. Porter Residence Hall: Just in time for the fall quarter, the campus is reopening the newly renovated and expanded Porter College Residence Hall B. Through creative engineering, the campus added a sixth floor to the building, providing an additional 120 "bedspaces" on campus. This increases the total capacity of Porter Residence Hall B to 468 residents.</p><p><b>Construction Just Beginning:</b></p><p>. Biomedical Research Building: Site preparation work began last December on this project, located in the Science Hill area of the campus. The four-story building will contain approximately 92,000 square feet of space to support interdisciplinary research for the Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Environmental Toxicology, and Biomolecular Engineering concentrating in health and medical issues. To support construction of the building, UCSC will receive $64.4 million of a new $199.9 million <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3140">UC systemwide bond agreement</a>. Another $1 million of the UC total will help the campus complete work on the Digital Arts Building (above).</p><p><b>Class Size Helps Mitigate Budget Challenges:</b></p><p>Bill Ladusaw, UCSC's vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, says reduced state support has made curriculum planning especially challenging this fall.</p><p>"When I met with incoming students, their parents, and other family members during our new-student orientations this summer, I acknowledged that some of the classes that students need for degrees would have to accommodate more people and that we would reduce the number of our elective classes," Ladusaw says.</p><p>But Ladusaw says the curriculum challenges have been at least partially offset by the fact that the size of the freshman class is smaller than in recent years. "We have ensured that the college core courses will be able to accommodate all of the entering frosh, and our tracking indicates that entering students were able to successfully enroll in a full schedule of classes this fall."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915cbc4d8072704601a012ff7c047cfe"><name>3196</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preview Days 2009 -- Saturdays, October 10 &amp; 17</title><start-date>1253084400000</start-date><display-name>Preview Days 2009 --...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3196</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3196</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339027953</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339027953</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Preview Day is the annual campus open house to connect prospective students and their families with UCSC faculty and staff. In an effort to provide the most meaningful experience possible for prospective students and their families while reducing costs, the campus will offer a revised version of Preview Day in 2009.</p>
<p>Preview Day 2009</p>
<p>Saturday, October 10 &amp; Saturday, October 17</p>
<p>. All participants will be required to register in advance online.</p>
<p>. There will be three sessions each day between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. followed by a campus walking tour. Each session covers key topics around undergraduate education, campus and student life, and admissions and eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>. The staffed Campus Resource and Student Life Fair has been eliminated from Preview Day; however, copies of key publications and/or lists of web resources will be provided.</p>
<p>We anticipate that with this new format, guests will have a consistently informative experience in a program that is clear and flows well. We expect to receive approximately the same number of visitors (1,800) that we have in previous years.</p>
<p>This year, campus units will not be asked to participate in any academic or campus life resource fairs. However, you are invited to send materials to be shared with guests over the two Saturdays. If your unit is interested in sharing publications, please send materials for approximately 900 guests to the Office of Admissions, mail stop Cook House, by Monday, October 5.</p>
<p>Also, you are welcome to open your offices on October 10 and/or October 17 in case prospective students and families would like to visit and ask questions. If you plan on opening your offices during those Saturdays, please contact Admissions Assistant Director Beatrice Atkinson-Myers at <a href="mail%20to:hfrogg@ucsc.edu">hfrogg@ucsc.edu</a>, ext. 9-2352, and let her know what days and hours you plan on opening.</p>

The start of a new academic year is an exciting time, and I look forward to welcoming you to the campus community. As you prepare to move in and reconnect with friends, I am writing with a short update about the Division of Student Affairs.</p><p>It has been a busy summer and you should expect some changes around campus, from facilities to programs and service hours. The renovations and repairs to the 50-meter pool are complete and the pool is open. Last spring, the Cowell/Stevenson Dining Hall was renovated and now offers expanded food options, and final touches are underway at the Porter College B renovation project. Also, throughout the division, many offices will operate with reduced services on Friday afternoons due to furloughs.</p><p>Students Affairs continues to reorganize and re-envision programs to maintain quality services for students. For example, a new Retention Services organization in Campus Life was created to bring together student engagement with academic support services and help you achieve your academic and personal goals. I am excited to work with the many student leaders across campus on ideas about how we can continue to meet your needs. Over the summer, I met with the officers of the Student Union Assembly (SUA), the official undergraduate student government at UCSC. SUA represents and advocates for students at the campus, system, and state levels. From student-led campaigns to college student government, there are many opportunities for you to get involved. For more information, call SUA at (831) 459-4838, log on to http://sua.ucsc.edu, or stop by the SUA office.</p><p>I encourage you to explore all that UCSC has to offer. The Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) Fall Festival on September 22, from 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. on the Upper East Field is the largest resource fair on campus and a great way to learn about how to get involved. You can find out about activities such as recreation and athletics, student organizations, clubs, resource centers, university interfaith council, environmental groups, fraternities, sororities, and more. Also on September 22 at 6:30 p.m. is the annual UCSC Boardwalk Frolic at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. A ticket to the event includes free bus transportation and parking, exclusive rides, and activities.</p><p>Our mission in Student Affairs is simple-to support you and create a living-learning community where you thrive, belong, and are engaged world citizens. Clearly you are the heart of the university and an integral part of our campus. The state and UC fiscal challenges are difficult, and we realize that you may be impacted as well. We are always available to help you. If you have questions, concerns, or need assistance, just ask. I also invite you to take advantage of my open office hours for students every Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on the second floor of Kerr Hall. Most importantly, I want you to be well and stay healthy. Many resources and support are available to you through the UCSC Student Health Center. Log on to <a href="www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter">www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter</a> for more information and to schedule an appointment.</p><p>Again, I welcome you to campus and look forward to meeting you. I hope your time on the campus will be exciting, challenging you in new and different ways. Your academic success is our top priority-study hard and enjoy your UCSC experience. Have a terrific year!</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>New and Continuing Undergraduate Students </audience><admin>Felicia McGinty, Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915cc2538072704601a012ff9c8b93b6"><name>3200</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cooper joins UN group's discussion of Muslim youth in Europe</title><summary>Psychology professor joins UN-sponsored symposium on Muslim youth in Europe.&#13;

In recent years, tensions have exploded violently in Paris, Madrid, and London, and widespread discontent simmers across the European continent, she added.</p><p>Cooper was invited by the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations to address a group of scholars, community leaders, and elected officials from 11 European nations during a two-day meeting in June entitled "Identity and Participation: Cross-Cultural and Muslim Youth in Europe." Established in 2005, the alliance is dedicated to exploring "the roots of polarization between societies and cultures today" and to developing a program to ease tensions. Its four program areas are youth, media, education, and migration.</p><p>"The United Nations is facilitating an open forum on these issues, and their focus on youth is especially important," said Cooper.</p><p>Her talk, "Cultural Brokers: Helping Immigrant Youth on their Pathways to College Identities in Multicultural Societies," built on insights gleaned during an ongoing 15-year collaboration with Elizabeth Domínguez, director of the Cabrillo Advancement Program at Cabrillo College. Cooper's "Bridging Multiple Worlds" initiative explores and documents the "pathways" that Mexican immigrant youth build to move through the "academic pipeline" from childhood to college.</p><p>Three key findings about Mexican youth in the United States are relevant for Muslims in Europe, according to Cooper:</p><p>. Dreams and aspirations--Individuals and families who decide to emigrate share dreams of achievement and opportunity that dispel the myth of low aspirations, said Cooper. Like many European immigrants before them, Mexicans who migrate to the United States want to succeed in the U.S. while preserving their cultural traditions, said Cooper.</p><p>. Cultural brokering--Many youth who make it to college "give back" by tutoring their siblings, friends, relatives, and other youth, becoming "bridges to the university," said Cooper.</p><p>. Second chances--Of those whose path to higher education is interrupted (by early parenthood, work opportunities, military service, or encounters with the criminal justice system), some make their way back into the pipeline, especially through the community college system.</p><p>One disparity between the United States and Europe, however, is in the availability of programs designed to build pathways to college for immigrant youth.</p><p>"For the most part, university programs and partnerships to encourage young Muslims to go to college are rare, although a few pioneering efforts have begun," said Cooper.</p><p>Cooper added that it was exciting to realize that work done in California is relevant in Europe.</p><p>"We dream of a common language, as Adrienne Rich famously said, and this was a version of that--an international conversation on justice," she said.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915cc3908072704601a012ff2f3c0bb8"><name>3201</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Impact on Transportation Services</title><start-date>1253170800000</start-date><display-name>Impact on Transportation Services...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3201</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3201</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339029855</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339029855</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Most transportation services will be curtailed or cancelled during the strike, possibly beginning as early as 6 a.m. Thursday morning.</p>

<ul>
<li>Special Perimeter Day Shuttle service will be provided approximately every 10 minutes from 7:30 a.m. until approximately 6 p.m. The Day Loop shuttle route will not operate during the strike. The Day Core route will operate on its regular schedule, while the Upper Campus route may be modified to serve the Main Entrance area while the strike is under way. Supervisory staff will operate the Disability Van Service (DVS) as regularly scheduled.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The Westside and UCSC Inn bike shuttles will not operate during the strike. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>SCMTD Metro transit service will not cross picket lines; buses will load and unload near the Bay/High intersection while pickets are present at the campus entrances.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>TAPS will provide free Daily parking permits for commuters arriving at the East Remote lot with three or more occupants. Commuters arriving with only one or two occupants may purchase Daily parking at the East Remote for $4. Permits will be available at the East Remote from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m. Thursday. Regular parking requirements will remain in effect at all other campus parking lots.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Commuters who drive to campus are strongly encouraged to carpool or rideshare during the strike. A reduced demand for parking and "sharing a ride" will help transit-dependent commuters access the campus during this week. Consider using Zimride, a new Facebook-based application available to UCSC affiliates, to find or share a ride. Visit <a href="http://www.zimride.com">www.zimride.com</a> and select the "UC Santa Cruz" network for more information.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Vanpool commuters are asked to coordinate among themselves to determine if their vanpool will operate during the strike, and to make carpooling arrangements if necessary.</li>
</ul>

(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta) </image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Alex Oswalt saw UC Santa Cruz, he fell in love with it.</p>
<p>So the 17-year-old freshman from Orangevale was pretty happy to be moving into his dorm Thursday morning, the first day of this year's "move-in" weekend at UCSC.</p>
<p>"It feels great," said the tall, dark-haired Oswalt, sitting at his desk in his dorm room at Merrill College while his parents checked out his new home and busily helped him unpack. "I'm a little nervous, though. I haven't met my roommate yet."</p>
<p>His parents, Patrick and Grace Oswalt, admitted to being a little nervous, too. Alex is their first child going off to college.</p>
<p>"We're not sure how we're going to react," said Grace, while making Alex's bed with navy blue sheets. "But we're happy for him. He likes Santa Cruz a whole lot."</p>
<p>Apart from his studies--he plans to major in computer game design--Alex said he's most interested in making some new friends.</p>
<p>His parents planned on buying a few things he needed that afternoon, then taking off and letting their son get settled.</p>
<p>"I remember when I went to college, and it was really exciting," said his mom. "So I'm pretty sure he feels the same way. It's a new world."</p>
<p>For mom RayDelle Kistler of Turlock, letting go was tough this year, even though she did it once already last year. Her daughter, sophomore Grace Kistler-Fair, 19, was moving into a new dorm room at Merrill that's larger than her freshman room.</p>
<p>"This year was harder," said RayDelle, fighting back tears. "When she came home for the summer, I had so many things I wanted to do, and there wasn't enough time."</p>
<p>Grace's dad, Mike Fair, looked on, amused.</p>
<p>"I'm good with it," he said with a smile, adding that both parents are extremely proud of their daughter, who they said is an "A" student and had won scholarships.</p>
<p>UCSC was Grace's first choice for college.</p>
<p>"I love the campus," said Grace, who wore a purple T-shirt, jeans, and black Vans. "It's beautiful. In Santa Cruz, there are the mountains, the forest, and the beach. The people are great, the classes are great, the teachers are amazing."</p>
<p>Her parents having taken a break and wandered outside, Grace got back to work unpacking the stuff essential to college life: school supplies, a printer, food for the mini-fridge, posters, T-shirts and jeans, a whiteboard for friends to write funny messages on, a guitar, and a ukulele.</p>

<p>At a groundbreaking celebration, Chancellor George Blumenthal thanked contributors and hailed the uniqueness of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems's research and education programs, which include the UCSC Farm, the Alan Chadwick Garden, and the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture.</p>
<p>Founded 42 years ago, the apprenticeship was "literally and figuratively groundbreaking," said Blumenthal, noting that UCSC's six-month, full-time organic training program has paved the way for sustainable-agriculture programs at other universities. "The UCSC program has served as a model," he said. "The kind of education that all of you are supporting at this farm is sorely needed today."</p>
<p>More than 1,300 people have graduated from the apprenticeship, which draws more than 50 percent women each year at a time when fewer than 15 percent of U.S. farm operators are women, added Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"With your support, we have helped ensure that this program will stay strong, to continue this important training for yet another four decades and beyond," he concluded.</p>
<p>Permanent on-site housing ensures that apprentices will continue to live on the Farm, keeping the program more affordable and accessible, as well as giving budding farmers the chance to "live where they learn."</p>
<p>"With the construction of the permanent housing, we will be laying the foundation for another 40 years of organic training at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden," said apprenticeship development coordinator Ann Lindsey.</p>
<p>More than 400 individuals and 60 businesses contributed to the campaign, with donations ranging from $25 to $50,000. More than $440,000 was raised, which will fund the construction of nine 4-unit cabins that will house 36 apprentices. The project includes redwood-and-canvas cabins, solar showers, accessible parking and paths, and other infrastructure. Construction is slated to be finished in time for the arrival of the 2010 class of apprentices in April.</p>

<p><em>that we did not leave off our education</em></p>
<p><em>when we begin to be men and women. It is</em></p>
<p><em>time that villages were universities, and their</em></p>
<p><em>elder inhabitants the fellows of universities.</em></p>
<p><em>- Henry David Thoreau</em></p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz takes your breath away.</p>
<p>As you stand high on the hill at Cowell College looking southwest, across gently undulating meadows, across a seaside town sparkling in the sun, across the crescent of Monterey Bay painted a deep aquamarine, you can't help feeling that this is truly a unique setting for a university. Apart. Monastic yet celebratory. The vista feels whole: sun, meadow, city, sea, an analog of our world, forests and grasslands, roads and houses, earth and air and ocean teeming with life. From our vantage high on the hill the sea recedes into the horizon, endless, boundless, beckoning toward the unknown yet knowable, to infinity across spaces curved by gravity and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Simply put, it's beautiful. Nearly everyone has that first reaction. Nearly everyone visiting the school for the first time says to themselves, "I've never seen a school in a place like this."</p>
<p>But UC Santa Cruz's physical beauty is not a postcard; it is not a static image that burns into one's mind to be recalled pleasurably now and again. Rather, it is a host. It sets the stage for a multiplicity of experiences. It focuses the mind, heightens the senses, stirs curiosity, broadens awareness.</p>
<p>No literature major walks through this Edenic campus without noticing the banana slugs saving redwood trees by clearing their bases of bacteria. No oceanographer misses the artistic possibilities suggested by both nature and man around virtually every corner. No business major can avoid the obvious conclusion that this world must be revered and preserved. No musician, filmmaker, actor, or sculptor misses the boundless universe that reaches through the night toward the beginnings of time. No computer engineer misses the symphonies of crickets in the woods or the "scree!" of red tailed hawks wheeling across the sky.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is an uncommon place. It transforms you. Provokes you. Inspires you. Not merely because of its uncommon beauty, but also because of its mission, because of the originality of its vision, and because of the uncommon people it draws to its heart.</p>
<p>Before it was born, Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry and other founders imagined UC Santa Cruz as a major research university, built around intimate residential colleges, dedicated to providing an extraordinary undergraduate experience, nurtured by close faculty-student interaction and human-scale community life. Their dream is our reality.</p>
<p>For undergrads, they wanted to create a university of colleges, of villages, each with its own specialty, its own theme, not organized by areas of study, but rather by broader topics, each of whom had a broad array of specialties embedded in it. To this day, each student takes a core course within the college in which they enrolled, a course not necessarily in their major, one that opens doors for them they might not open themselves, that involves them with other students with whom they live, and faculty who are members not only of their departments but of the college as well. At the same time, faculty and students range far from their individual colleges, far from their individual disciplines, teaching and taking classes all over this surprisingly large campus.</p>
<p>Today, the founding fathers' rich vision and novel format has matured even further, taking a shape and expressing itself in ways they didn't imagine.</p>
<p>Because now, in addition to the college system, UC Santa Cruz has developed its overarching academic plan itself into six interdisciplinary themes: <em>Cross-Cultural Initiatives; Evolving Environments, Science and Policy; Human Health Studies; Media and Communications; Technological Developments and Their Societal Impacts;</em> and <em>Transnationalism and Globalization.</em> Each of these themes represents an ecosystem of thought that embraces a complex intersection of talents and values, of science and art, policy and technology, engineering and humanity, language, biology and mathematics.</p>
<p>So, as an undergraduate student, you study your major; as a member of a college, you work and learn joined with others in a small community; as a unique student, an uncommon member of the university at large, you interact and intersect with a wide variety of other students and faculty, each of whom is conjoined through a network of ideas, disciplines and projects, of thoughts and opinions, philosophies and actions, a network of themes whose existence-though not its specific character-was built into the very founding structure and vision of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>And when our students graduate, when they move forward into a complex working world, with all that world entails, they are better prepared to understand it, to wield it, and to thrive in it.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is located just 25 miles from Silicon Valley, the center of the world for a number of industries: biotechnology, information sciences, space sciences, and computer science, to name a few. At UC Santa Cruz we believe it is one of our duties to train a work force of engaged specialists prepared for the rigors of Silicon Valley. That's why we offer an undergraduate major in computer game development, building a rich set of skills that include technology, storytelling, art and big business. Our Jack Baskin School of Engineering doesn't look like most engineering schools; for example, we offer no civil engineering. Instead, we offer Applied Math and Statistics. Bio-Molecular Engineering. Computer Engineering. Computer Science. Electrical Engineering. Information Management. Our students are probing structures at the crossroads of electricity and human function, exploring and fusing particle and cellular behavior that will change the very fabric of our lives and our futures. As well, they're preparing for practical realities, preparing to take their positions in the world of the future, a world that's reborn again every couple of years here in the cradle of technology.</p>
<p>Yet we're about much more than Silicon Valley. We're a major research university breaking through to new concepts in history, in astrophysics, in digital media, in linguistics, in music, in social policy, the environment, literature, theater, anthropology, economics and biology and art.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is a research university with an unusual structure. Compare. Stanford University is a bit smaller than UCSC, and is comprised of 45 undergraduate students for every 55 graduate students. In contrast, UCSC has 91 undergrads for every 9 grads. That promises huge benefits in two directions. Undergraduate students have an uncommon opportunity to participate in the front lines of research projects. And grad students are given an uncommon opportunity to take prominent roles in their areas of discipline, in exploring, inventing, and creating new applications of science, in developing sophisticated social policy, in uncovering new discoveries in history, anthropology, and literature, in creating new music, new art, new film and new media.</p>
<p>By moving our students more quickly to the front lines of research, we give them greater access to the top echelons of the academic world, accelerating their momentum, driving them to take more responsibility for discovery, and helping them grow internally and externally to become disciplined, intense and respected thought leaders in their fields.</p>
<p>The heart of the engine that drives UC Santa Cruz of course is its faculty. With our research orientation, we seek and attract explorers, wonderers, extraordinary women and men who relentlessly ask why, how, what if. We are a magnet for restless minds, ones who are not content with their discontent, but rather seek to shape their questions into discoveries, and their discoveries into applications, inventions, a higher order of philosophy, of understanding, of human consciousness, of technological and societal evolution.</p>
<p>Because of our embedded cross-disciplinary themes, we seek and attract fecund and hungry adventurers who push for deeper understanding by crossing borders and embracing collaborators equally hungry to approach the same problem from complementary disciplines and directions, adding an amazing richness with entirely different skills, points of view and expertise.</p>
<p>And because of our uncommon dedication to undergraduate education, we seek and attract educators. Teachers. People who have the passion to challenge, poke, prod, and provoke our students, not only into thought, but into action. We look for professors who understand not only how to transmit knowledge and hone skills, but who also understand how to light fires, ignite curiosity, inflame desire, and unleash genuine care, to transform students who become the alumni who transform the world.</p>
<p>And our alumni have done just that. Our graduates continue on to graduate school in greater numbers than those of any UC campus save Berkeley. They've gone on to become astronauts and TV stars, conductors and engineers, to transform medical services in Africa, run newspapers and write monumental works of fiction.</p>
<p>Our faculty and grad students are transforming the world with their research projects.</p>
<p>A joint project between our linguistics department, our School of Engineering and NASA Ames has developed a new plain-English-dialog-capable robot for use in space.</p>
<p>Our history department and digital media department have created a massive web site exploring, in deep pictorial detail, all of the Pacific theater battle sites of WWII.</p>
<p>Our bio-engineering department is turning out inventions to help blind people use computers, negotiate their way using a laser cane, find bathrooms in public places.</p>
<p>Our biology and physics department are studying neural networks to develop technologies that someday will help blind people see.</p>
<p>Our Literature department has joined with our anthropology department to study the recent discovery of ancient Indian texts, revealing histories and art never before known.</p>
<p>Our theater department has created the Shakespeare Festival and the Dickens Festival, two of the most celebrated events of their kind in the nation, serving not only the academic community but also the greater Santa Cruz community in which we are proud partners. And soon, the Performing Arts Center is about to be augmented with a major new Arts Complex, offering even more performing venues and a museum, an arts center to welcome the town community.</p>
<p>Our partnership with the City of Santa Cruz continues to grow and evolve. Together we're exploring solutions to the real world issues of traffic, housing, water and power. As we move into the next decade we pledge to do everything in our power to fuse our mutual dreams of creating a more sustainable, green community that will become the pride of California and a model for the nation.</p>
<p>To the parents of our incoming freshman, we pledge to train and educate your students, so that by the time they graduate they're prepared to take their place in the working world, armed with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.</p>
<p>To our undergraduate students, we pledge that when you do move on, to take your part in transforming another organization, family, or community, you'll look back at your experiences here, and be proud of the many ways UC Santa Cruz has become part of you.</p>
<p>To our graduate students, we pledge to give you the opportunities and support you need to take your rightful place as thought leaders in your discipline, to have the credential, the reputation and the authority you need to take your world to the next level.</p>
<p>To our faculty we pledge to give you the freedom and the support you need to explore, the platform and megaphone you need to reach and teach the world, and the fervent colleagues and positive, collaborative environment you need to push through to new ideas, new inventions, and new discoveries that help our world and our lives evolve.</p>
<p>To our alumni, we pledge to make your connection with UC Santa Cruz a lifelong relationship, a continuing gateway to new intelligent and interesting experiences, and a badge of honor you'll proudly display through your life.</p>
<p>And to this uncommonly beautiful place, to this redwood forest we inhabit, to these rolling hills, this oceanside haven, this peaceful paradise, we pledge to be responsible stewards, to heed your reminders and use the inspiration you provide to build a better world, a cleaner world, a healthier world, a world that would make our world itself feel proud.</p>

Program cuts and consolidations, pay reductions, and furloughs, all threaten to overshadow the promise and possibilities that brought most of us to UC Santa Cruz.</p><p> </p><p>Today, on the cusp of a new academic year, I want to focus for a moment on a few of those possibilities.</p><p> </p><p>Nearly 4,150 new undergraduates are enrolled this fall. It's a bright, highly diverse group. Over a third will be first in their families to earn college degrees. They arrive at UC Santa Cruz teeming with curiosity, energy and potential - and, perhaps, a bit of normal anxiety.</p><p> </p><p>We share a collective opportunity and responsibility to help these students - and all undergraduate and graduate students - reach their intellectual potential.</p><p> </p><p>UC Santa Cruz research aspirations have never been more promising. We've broken ground on a new center for biomedical research. This fall, we will dedicate a new Digital Arts Research Center. We are progressing on plans to develop a multi-institutional research and educational center in Silicon Valley, at NASA/Ames.</p><p> </p><p>We all share the uncommon opportunity to support an internationally acclaimed portfolio of research that already has uncommon global impact.</p><p> </p><p>Our local community relies on and benefits from the considerable economic boost our students and their families, as well as faculty and staff, bring to the region. That is in addition to the incalculable impact of our collective public service efforts, including internships, volunteer activities, and other forms of intellectual engagement.</p><p> </p><p>It is perfectly understandable that some of you are frustrated about certain policy decisions, the impacts of budget cuts, or the certainty of additional budget cuts next year. I understand that on some campuses, including ours, labor actions could impact the opening of classes this Thursday. I hope that those who participate in this action try to minimize disruption to our students - the people we are here to serve.</p><p> </p><p>Recently, I had the opportunity to re-read a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3211">beautiful essay</a> by Michael Gould, a proud UCSC alumnus and communications professional. This essay captures far better than I can the essence of UC Santa Cruz - what makes it such an exceptional and uncommon place to study, work, and serve.</p><p> </p><p>I encourage you to take a few minutes to read it ... and hope it makes you feel as good about being a part of this great institution as it does me.</p><p> </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ce43d8072704601a012ff4e04ed17"><name>3215</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Yudof talks about fiscal crisis, possible fee increases</title><summary>Videos of President Mark Yudof's remarks to the UC Regents on September 16, 2009.</summary><keywords>Mark Yudof, UC Regents</keywords><description>Videos of President Mark Yudof's remarks to the UC Regents on September 16, 2009.</description><start-date>1253516400000</start-date><display-name>Yudof talks about fiscal...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3215</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3215</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339038204</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339038204</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/09/images/yudof.regents.mtg.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/09/images/yudof.regents.mtg.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yudof.regents.mtg.300.jpg</name><file-size>7553</file-size><width>300</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UC President Mark Yudof</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC President Mark Yudof says students have a right to be angry over the possibility of fee increases.

<p>As the University pay reduction/furlough program takes effect this fall, most of UCSC's workforce will be unavailable for work an average of 8 percent of the time - almost two full working days a month per employee. When combined with the significant budget cuts sustained over the past two years, the  campus has much less capacity to support our students, faculty, and staff in their daily work.</p>

<p>In order to help you understand and navigate the impacts of budget cuts, the following information has been compiled.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Budget-related service impacts</h3>
<br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>In order to accommodate budget cuts and furloughs, some offices are beginning to reduce their operating hours and modify their procedures; they are coordinating with offices offering like or related services so as to minimize the disruption to clients.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>It is recommended that before you visit or call an office, check their website for the latest information about how they have adjusted or redesigned their services.  To make it easier to find such announcements, each major service provider has agreed to post such information on their home page and to use the "budget squeeze" graphic (<em>shown above)</em> to call your attention to their link.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The following are examples of the types of service reductions or changes that have been implemented thus far:
<ul>
<li>Greater dependence on automated telephone attendant functions and/or voice mail to handle voice calls.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Greater use of email for submitting questions or service problems; in doing so, include all the relevant information needed to respond satisfactorily to your request.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Some offices have implemented, for example, a "Friday light" schedule where the office may be closed to the public one or two days per month but there are still staff onsite behind the scenes handling workload backlogs.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Even in these trying times where, by necessity, it is not possible to be as responsive as in the past, the goal of each service office is that they will maintain their reputation as a team of responsive, friendly, and client-focused staff.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>The goal of each academic/instructional department-even as the campus is forced to trim classes-is that each undergraduate and graduate student will have access to the service courses they need to fulfill their general education or foundational requirements and/or the courses in their major needed to complete their degree in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Catmull</strong> is often described as the man who defined a generation of moviegoers and animation fans. He is co-founder of Pixar and currently president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. Before that, he was vice president of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, Ltd., where he managed four development efforts in the areas of computer graphics, video editing, video games and digital audio.</p>
<p>Known for his strong emphasis on nurturing creative and interdisciplinary work environments to foster innovation, Catmull has been honored with four Academy Awards--including the Gordon E. Sawyer Award in 2009, for lifetime technological contributions to the film industry.</p>
<p>Catmull has also received the Coons Award--the highest achievement in the computer graphics field for his lifetime contributions, as well as the animation industry's Ub Iwerks Award--for technical advancements that make a significant impact on the art or industry of animation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rebeles</strong> have become strong pillars of the Santa Cruz County community, giving valuable financial and volunteer support to a vast array of organizations, charities and causes in the arts, education and human services.</p>
<p>A re-entry graduate of UCSC with a BA in Art History, Patricia served for 11 years as a trustee of the UCSC Foundation Board, as well as on the board of the Museum of Art and History. Rowland has served as President of the Santa Cruz County Symphony Board, and also the California First Amendment Coalition. The Rebeles were additionally instrumental in founding the River Street homeless center in downtown Santa Cruz that now bears their name.</p>
<p>They established the Rebele Chair in Art History at UCSC in 1996, and also created the Rebele Art History Endowment at the University Library. The Rebeles have provided support for a wide variety of other campus programs including Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the Arboretum, the University Center, Arts &amp; Lectures, Pacific Rim Music Festival and Friends of Long Marine Laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Rickford</strong> has spent more than 40 years studying varieties of English spoken by poor and marginalized communities--examining how they are structured, how they evolve, and what role they should have in the classroom. He is the author of several books, including The Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English, which received an American Book Award in 2000.</p>
<p>Rickford received recognition during the Oakland Ebonics controversy of 1996-97, when the Oakland School Board voted to take into account African American vernacular language (Ebonics) in their language arts lessons. Rickford has also been a dedicated mentor to students; among his former students are a member of the U.S. Congress (Barbara Lee, D-Oakland) and faculty at the nation's top linguistics programs.</p>
<p>Rickford graduated from UCSC in 1971 with highest honors, and he has been a professor of linguistics at Stanford University since 1980. Through his scholarly work in sociolinguistics, he has enhanced understanding of the connections between language, ethnicity, and social class.</p>
<p><strong>Friedman</strong> is a well-known economist and theorist who has published widely in leading academic journals in economics, finance, psychology, and politics.</p>
<p>The coauthor of four academic books, 12 National Science Foundation grants, and more than 50 original research articles, Friedman joined the UCSC faculty in 1985, after teaching at UCLA and UC Berkeley. He has broad research interests in applied economic theory--with a recent emphasis on learning and evolution, laboratory experiments, and financial markets.</p>

<p>Friedman's recent book, <em>Morals and Markets: An Evolutionary Perspective on the Modern World</em>, contends that our moral codes and our market systems, while often in conflict, are really devices evolved to achieve similar ends.</p>

However, I am pleased to announce that Tyrus Miller has agreed to serve in that position on an interim basis, subject to Regental approval for the appointment.</p><p>I want to thank Professor Sloan for her service to the Graduate Studies Division, as well as for her earlier service as Associate Dean.  In her term as Graduate Dean, she has expanded and organized the Graduate Division into a highly effective office which is serving the campus very well.  Lisa will be resuming her role as Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and her research in paleoclimatology and climate change.</p><p>Professor Miller brings a wealth of experience in academic administration and graduate studies, as well as continuity to Graduate Division leadership.  He has been serving as Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and as the co-provost for Cowell College.  From 2006 to 2008, Professor Miller was a member of the Graduate Council and served as chair in 2007-08.  Earlier, he served as Director of the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) in Budapest.</p><p>Professor Miller joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1999 and currently is a Professor of Literature. He earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University in English, and received a concurrent B.A./M.A. in Humanities from Johns Hopkins University, where he later received a second M.A. in Creative Writing.

David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, and James Kent, a research scientist in the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, will accept the award on October 24 during the annual meeting of the ASHG in Honolulu.   </p><p>The Stern Award is presented for outstanding achievements in the field of human genetics during the past decade. Haussler and Kent were selected for their contributions to genetic research through the conception and development of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, which "continues to have a significant impact on a wide variety of research applications throughout the human genetics community." Haussler and Kent are credited with the assembly and public release of the first "working draft" of the human genome in June 2000. </p><p>Haussler is the director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC, codirector of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. His research focuses on the comparison of DNA sequences between a wide range of species in an effort to identify functional regions and gain insight into evolution. </p><p>Haussler's previous awards include the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award in 2008 and the Carnegie Mellon University Dickson Prize for Science in 2006. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. </p><p>Kent is director of the UCSC Genome Browser project, which provides researchers around the world with free access to a wide variety of information about the human genome, including its complete available sequence and those of other animal species for comparison. Supplementing these sequences, the UCSC Genome Browser incorporates data and links to research on countless regions of functional DNA. </p><p>Kent was awarded the Overton Prize for outstanding achievements in computational biology by the ISCB in 2003. His work on the human genome project was also featured in the 2007 book <i>Beautiful Code</i>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d05c98072704601a012ff1449f03a"><name>3233</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Physicist Anthony Aguirre is featured in a story in the October issue of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; magazine about the idea of multiple universes.</summary><description>Physicist Anthony Aguirre is featured in a story in the October issue of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; magazine about the idea of multiple universes.</description><start-date>1253862000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3233</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3233</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339046776</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339046776</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Physicist Anthony Aguirre is featured in a story in the October issue of <em><strong>Discover</strong></em> magazine about a conference he organized to investigate the idea of multiple universes and the possibility of detecting evidence of collisions between universes.</p>

As head of research and development at VaxGen, he oversaw the first two large-scale clinical trials of AIDSVAX, which failed to show efficacy. </p><p>In the new trial, involving 16,000 adult participants in Thailand, AIDSVAX was combined with another experimental vaccine, ALVAC, produced by Sanofi Pasteur, in a "prime-boost" regimen. In this trial, known as RV 144, the vaccination strategy was found to be safe and 31 percent effective in preventing new HIV infections.</p><p>"This combined approach was designed to stimulate both cellular and antibody-based responses, whereas previous vaccines stimulated just one or the other," Berman said. </p><p>The RV 144 regimen involved four doses of ALVAC as the priming vaccine, followed by two doses of AIDSVAX as the booster vaccine. The nonprofit Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases now holds the rights for AIDSVAX. Berman contributed to the design of the RV 144 trial while he was at VaxGen, but was not directly involved in the conduct of the trial. He did not know about the results until they were publicly announced by the partners that ran the trial, which include the U.S. Army, the National Institutes of Health, and the Thai Ministry of Public Health.</p><p>"This trial was a heroic effort, and the sponsors were successful in overcoming many obstacles. This result is a testament to their dedication and perseverance," Berman said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Berman received a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=3179">$3.5 million grant from NIH</a> to fund his ongoing AIDS vaccine research efforts.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d0a848072704601a012fff1f0d657"><name>3236</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Journalist Edward Luce to discuss India and global warming on October 18 at UCSC</title><summary>Journalist Edward Luce will discuss India and climate change during the Ninth Annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture on October 18.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>luce, maitra, india, climate change, global warming, lecture, financial times</keywords><description>Journalist Edward Luce will discuss India and climate change during the Ninth Annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture on October 18.</description><start-date>1254294000000</start-date><display-name>Journalist Edward Luce to...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3236</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3236</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339048016</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339048016</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/09/images/luce.290.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/09/images/luce.290.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>luce.290.jpg</name><file-size>54490</file-size><width>290</width><height>414</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Edward Luce</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Climate change poses enormous environmental, economic, and diplomatic challenges for India, and its choices will have international consequences, predicts author and journalist Edward Luce.</p>
<p>Climate change isn't an abstract threat in India, where the Ganges is already being impacted by melting Himalayan glaciers. India's response to the crisis will demand that the global community finally cast off antiquated, romantic notions of India and wake up to the reality of a nation that is poised to displace Japan as the world's third-largest economy by 2030, says Luce.</p>
<p>Luce will discuss "Mystic India in the Age of Global Warming" as the featured speaker for the Ninth Annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture on Sunday, October 18, at 4 p.m. in the UCSC Music Recital Hall. His talk is free and open to the public, but tickets are required. Tickets are available online through <a href="https://www.santacruztickets.com/Online/">santacruztickets.com</a> or by phone at (831) 459-2159. Parking will be available in the Performing Arts parking lot; permits will be available for $3. Luce's presentation will include a question-and-answer session and will be followed by a public reception.</p>
<p>Luce is the Washington bureau chief of the <em>The Financial Times</em> of London and the author of the 2006 book, <em>In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India</em>. Before moving to Washington, Luce was based in New Delhi as the newspaper's South Asia bureau chief from 2001 to 2005. In addition to his career in journalism, Luce spent a year as the speech writer to Larry Summers, then-U.S. treasury secretary under President Clinton.</p>
<p>India is a nation positioned for greatness, but it is still seen by many as a country of "snakecharmers and holy cows" that transcends materialism, said Luce. Such persistent misperceptions place India at a terrific disadvantage as the global community gears up for this winter's Copenhagen summit on climate change. India is resisting strenuous calls for targeted carbon-emission reductions.</p>
<p>"India is being asked to undercut its ability to develop, but fewer than two-thirds of the people in India have electricity," he said. "They can't cut emissions without consigning more people to darkness for years to come."</p>
<p>India, which is home to 20 percent of the world's population, contributes only 4 percent of the world's global carbon emissions--and has generated only 1 percent of historic emissions, he said. "It would be grossly inequitable to ask them to cut more in a nation where per capita income is $1,000," he said. "Comparable reductions in the United States would mean the average American would have to downsize from an SUV to a normal, gas-guzzling car. In India, if you haven't got electricity, exactly what would you downgrade to?"</p>
<p>The answer, said Luce, lies in a new, low-carbon development pattern that will require the assistance of the entire global community. If Western nations insist instead on a global cap-and-trade program, Luce predicts they will never reach agreement with India and China--to everyone's peril.</p>

Blumenthal. "It reflects the wide-ranging support UC Santa Cruz enjoys and the willingness of a growing number of private donors to help the campus in an era of eroding public funding for the university. We depend on their support to bridge the gap."</p><p>A total of 14,132 people donated to the campus during the 2008-09 fiscal year, up from 12,010 donors during the previous 12-month period. The surge was aided by strong support from alumni and parents of current students: the number of alumni donors jumped nearly 11 percent over the previous year, while the number of parent donors increased by 8.5 percent. </p><p>"Parents and alumni know so well the value of a UC Santa Cruz education, and we are particularly grateful for their contributions to our mission," said Blumenthal, noting that overall student support, which includes scholarships, reached $2.5 million, including $1.6 million for graduate students. </p><p>The infusion of support enabled the campus to nearly match last year's fundraising total of $31.6 million, despite the economic downturn.</p><p>In only its second year, the Parents Fund raised more than $180,000 as families channeled their support toward student activities, scholarships, the library, and other aspects of the student experience. In addition, parents made targeted gifts to support the purchase of equipment for the Film and Digital Media program and to create a fellowship in interdisciplinary environmental research.</p><p>The Grateful Dead's gift of the band's massive archive led private giving. Valued at $8 million, the archive consists of an extraordinary collection of photographs, promotional items, business records, and correspondence. The one-of-a-kind gift is an invaluable addition to the University Library, which will become a destination for scholars, fans, and members of the public who are eager to explore the phenomenon of one of the most influential bands in history.</p><p>In addition, friends of the campus helped fund scholarships, research, facilities, and more. A few examples of their generosity follow:</p><p>. Sony Corporation contributed more than $450,000 toward scholarships for undergraduates in the campus's new computer gaming major.</p><p>. Alumnus Nion T. McEvoy pledged $250,000 toward the expansion of McHenry Library, a gift will that will help meet a fundraising challenge posed by the Kresge Foundation. When the campus raises $3.5 million toward the expansion, the foundation will contribute $700,000 to the effort.</p><p>. Alumnus Stephen Bruce and his wife, Mona, gave $50,000 to the Center for Integrated Water Research, a new interdisciplinary initiative that takes a regional approach to water-supply issues.</p><p>. Cowell College students continue to benefit from the generosity of parent John Harriman and alumnus Gary Licker, whose estate gifts generated more than $50,000 last year. </p><p>. Students with ties to Marin County will benefit from the $100,000 Constant M. and Tempest B. van Vlierden Scholarship Endowment.</p><p>. Alumnus Quentin Hancock's $10,000 gift established The New Teachers Fund, which supports students getting their teaching credentials. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d11118072704601a012ff7d17eae9"><name>3240</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Academic program for community college students wins extended NIH funding</title><summary>A UCSC program that provides an academic bridge for community college students has received a $1.1 million grant from the NIH.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>ACCESS, Phil Crews</keywords><description>A UCSC program that provides an academic bridge for community college students has received a $1.1 million grant from the NIH.</description><start-date>1254121200000</start-date><display-name>Academic program for community...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3240</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3240</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339049647</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339049647</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A UCSC program that provides an academic bridge for community college students interested in pursuing careers in research science has received a five-year, $1.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). </p><p>Since 1994, the ACCESS Program at UCSC has been funded by three-year grants from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under the Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program. Directed by Phil Crews, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, the ACCESS initiative offers enrichment activities at community colleges during the academic year and research opportunities at UCSC during the summer.</p><p>The program is a partnership between UCSC and five neighboring community colleges: Cabrillo College, Gavilan College, Hartnell College, Monterey Peninsula College, and San Jose City College. It focuses on students whose academic goals and potential have been affected by disadvantageous circumstances and students who belong to groups with below-average UC enrollment rates. According to Crews, educators have found that research-based activities provide a powerful tool to stimulate students just beginning their college careers. </p><p>"Enrichment activities that plug into biomedical research being carried out by UCSC faculty and staff provide the means to propel the program forward," Crews said. "Our continuing goal is to strengthen academic skills, increase university transfer and retention rates, and promote interest and participation in scientific research." </p><p>The renewed grant will enable UCSC to continue the ACCESS Summer Research Institute, in which 12 to 14 students each summer spend eight weeks living on campus and participating in research projects in chemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and environmental toxicology.</p><p>Pam D'Arcey, associate director of the program, said the grant is usually renewed in May but was delayed this year because of the economic climate. News of continued funding for the program came in September, just as this year's summer ACCESS students were presenting their research posters to professors, mentors, and family members.</p><p>"I was ecstatic when I heard the news," D'Arcey said. "The ACCESS program is extremely valuable to science students at our community colleges, especially now that they are facing the loss of so many academic support programs due to budget cuts."</p><p>The NIGMS panel that reviewed the program acknowledged that it was very strong and has seen tremendous successes. The panel's report noted that the ACCESS program "is poised to make even greater strides by transitioning minority students into UCSC in a way that they complete the undergraduate degree and move toward graduate degree programs."</p><p>Additional information about the program is available on the ACCESS Program <a href="http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/projects/access/">web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d19208072704601a012ff5913f5db"><name>3243</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seasonal Flu Shot Clinics on Campus for Staff and Faculty</title><start-date>1254121200000</start-date><display-name>Seasonal Flu Shot Clinics...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3243</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3243</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339051756</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339051756</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Student Health Center is once again offering seasonal flu shots for campus staff and faculty.

<p>Dear UCSC Colleague,</p>
<p>As you no doubt have read in recent newspaper accounts, the UCSC Arboretum is undergoing a major restructuring in response to serious financial difficulties. This restructuring effort, I am very sorry to report, has required layoffs of some of the valuable and hardworking staff there; I very much regret the very real impact that this is having on these individuals.</p>
<p>While I am writing to assure you of our plans to retain the facility as a living and public repository for horticultural collections, I suffer no illusions about the challenge of doing so with fewer staff. But I believe it is possible, and am working with staff to develop an organizational structure that refocuses the Arboretum operation on two goals: preserving the Arboretum's existing collections, and maintaining public access to those collections.</p>
<p>I also want to provide you with background information on the depth of the Arboretum's fiscal challenges.</p>
<p>By now it's not news to you that the state's serious budget problems have resulted in one-time and ongoing cuts to UC Santa Cruz of approximately $50 million. In the early rounds of budget reductions last fiscal year, no reductions were made to the Arboretum funding. As you all know too well, recent budget cuts have left us with few options but to cut more deeply and painfully across university operations.</p>
<p>Entering a new fiscal year, it became painfully clear that the Arboretum had to downsize in order to address three areas of fiscal concern:</p>

<ul>
<li>In recent years, the campus has provided the Arboretum with $130,000 annually. On a campus that has sustained $50 million in reductions in state support, this money is no longer available for Arboretum expenses. The campus will continue to cover the cost of water and other utilities for the Arboretum.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Even with the campus contribution, the Arboretum's operating deficit for 2008-09 was approximately $225,000. In the last decade, the amount of the Arboretum deficit spending has varied from approximately $20,000 to over $500,000 per year. A cumulative debt now reaches $1.8 million, and interest payments on this debt are an increasing drain on the Arboretum resources.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Approximately 20 percent of the annual revenue has come from endowment earnings. The downturn in the stock market will reduce this revenue source by approximately $60,000 for the coming year, further contributing to the need for an Arboretum operational plan that is in sync with its budget.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In closing, while I can say with confidence that the campus is absolutely committed to keeping the Arboretum open, I believe it will remain open only if we can put in place an operation at the facility that is truly sustainable.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Alison Galloway</p>
<p>Vice Provost and Dean, Academic Affairs</p>

I'm George Blumenthal. </p><p>As we begin an exciting new academic year, UC Santa Cruz has  much</p><p>to be proud of. Much to look forward to. And a few challenges in the immediate future. </p><p>I want to speak with you today about all three. </p><p>As a member of our campus community for over 30 years, I've seen, up close, the incredible promise and impact of UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Landmark research discoveries. Curious, engaged, energized  students. Alumni who think - and act - with a unique desire to serve others, not just themselves.</p><p>A breathtaking campus that has matured - responsibly and thoughtfully - with respect for its surroundings.</p><p>Whether you are a member of our academic or administrative staffs, a new or returning undergrad or graduate student, there are plenty of reasons to be proud to be a Banana Slug. </p><p>Santa Cruz is an internationally acclaimed center of research excellence. From the stars to stem cells, energy conservation to economic theory, from linguistics to music, our research ranks with Harvard's and MIT's for overall impact. </p><p>Our faculty continue to win accolades. University Professor Sandra Faber, one of the world's leading astrophysicists, won the Bower Award and Prize - one of the most prestigious prizes for scientific achievement. </p><p>We are also at the forefront of the campus sustainability movement, and we're steadily reducing our carbon footprint. Our dining halls, for example, are rated the nation's greenest. (So, to you new students, don't worry - you'll get used to carrying food without trays.)</p><p>I'm delighted to report our water conservation efforts have cut usage 31% since May, more than double the goal the city of Santa Cruz asked for. </p><p>In addition to the environment, we also remain committed to diversity. Our goal is clear: to reflect in our faculty, staff, and students the diversity of California's population and cultures. </p><p>As you know, UCSC has always been known as a leader in undergraduate education. Now, we've enhanced our general education requirements, ensuring that every student leaves Santa Cruz with a set of core skills. Such as the ability to write and speak effectively within their academic discipline.</p><p>Our students continue to excel. Just last year, eight won Fulbright Scholarships for international study. </p><p>And our men's tennis team won another NCAA team title - its 7th in 20 years. </p><p>So, what's happening this fall? Just a few highlights:</p><p>We will soon celebrate the opening of the new digital arts research center. </p><p>We broke ground on a new biomedical building. And we're expanding and improving the Student Health Center.  </p><p>We will celebrate our legacy for innovation by welcoming the president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios as part of our annual Founder's Day celebration on October 23rd.</p><p>I did mention challenges and we do have some. </p><p>Shrinking state support. More priorities and opportunities than the funds to support them.</p><p>Understandable frustration over pay cuts and furloughs.</p><p>State budget cuts will impact every member of the campus community and all of us are being asked to do our share. </p><p>Let me assure you that I know these are big issues. We will address them together. And, in time, we will surmount them. And, move forward.</p><p>I'll be in touch throughout the year. And I welcome hearing from you - through an e-mail, at <a href="mailto:chancellor@ucsc.edu">chancellor@ucsc.edu</a>, a personal visit during my open office hours, through the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">ucsc.edu</a> Website, or a personal hello when you see me around campus. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d20848072704601a012ff8c999c27"><name>3248</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Career Center Fall Events - Job Fairs for Students</title><start-date>1254294000000</start-date><display-name>Career Center Fall Events...</display-name><path>/2009/09/3248</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/09/3248</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339053648</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339053648</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Our students are concerned about their future. The job outlook for college graduates has become increasingly challenging. Between March 2008 and March 2009, the unemployment rate more than doubled for college graduates and it is projected that liberal arts students will be hardest hit. In a recent survey by the Collegiate Employment Research Institute, only six percent of employers reported they want to hire humanities or liberal arts majors, and only ve percent of employers are hiring social science majors.</p>

We are writing to provide you with guidance on how to work with your employees by taking the necessary precautions during this outbreak to meet the University's obligation to provide a safe workplace.</p>
<p>Based upon CDC recommendations, members of the campus community who develop flu-like symptoms (fever and chills AND a cough or sore throat) should stay home for a period of at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever or no longer have signs of a fever without using fever-reducing medicines. This would likely be a period of 3-5 days.</p>
<p>Employees who are self-isolating due to flu-like symptoms should contact their supervisors promptly to let them know. Managers and supervisors should encourage employees who appear to be ill to take leave and seek medical assistance from their health care provider.</p>
<p>If an employee reports to work ill and declines to take leave, managers and supervisors should consult with their Staff Human Resources Partner or the Academic Personnel Office for assistance in determining whether there is objective evidence of influenza-like illness. Action should not be taken based solely on a manager's or a supervisor's subjective assessment of an employee's medical condition.</p>
<p>During this time, it is extremely important that the Student Health Center be able to monitor the prevalence of flu within our campus population.</p>
<p>To assist in this effort, we have established a web based H1N1 Incident Reporting tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/h1n1_report.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/h1n1_report.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting is voluntary, but important because of the public health implications. Managers and supervisors are asked to report, on a weekly basis, the number of known or suspected flu incidents within your staff and academic employee population. Academic department managers are asked to coordinate the reporting of incidents within their academic employee population by requesting that academic employees inform the department office if they are ill with flu-like symptoms. You are asked to submit your reports by close of business on Thursday of each week. Please note that this is an incident count: one employee who calls in sick for 5 days should be reported as one incident.</p>
<p>The Office of the President has prepared a <strong><em>Frequently Asked Questions and Guidance for Managers and Supervisors</em></strong> document available at: <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/riskmgt/emergprep/eonews/documents/h1n1_faq.pdf">http://www.ucop.edu/riskmgt/emergprep/eonews/documents/h1n1_faq.pdf</a></p>
