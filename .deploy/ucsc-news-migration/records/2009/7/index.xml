Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Social Sciences. The <a href=" http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1703">award</a>, announced by UCSC Social Sciences Division Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki, recognizes senior faculty members who have made major contributions through their research. Zihlman was the unanimous choice of the award selection committee.</p><p>Zihlman's research has had major impacts on the fields of physical anthropology and human evolution. In the 1970s, her critique of the "Man the Hunter" model opened the way for researchers to incorporate the role of females in hominid biological evolution and in human cultural development, an approach that has since become mainstream.</p><p>Zihlman's early work focused on locomotion and the transition to walking on two feet, comparing the anatomy of modern humans and other primates to the fossil remains of ancestral species. Her thorough and painstaking anatomical studies have broadly influenced the field of paleoanthroplogy.</p><p>Zihlman pioneered the "life history" approach to physical anthropology and human evolution. Her work focuses on how anatomical differences reflect differences in lifetime behavior, and her findings have shed light on parenting behavior and the transition to adulthood.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Zihlman launched another novel line of research when she began a painstaking analysis of individual chimpanzee skeletons whose life histories had been recorded by Jane Goodall and colleagues. She has continued to perform detailed muscle-by-muscle, organ-by-organ autopsies on recently deceased great apes--gorillas, chimps, orangutans--with known life histories, making an unparalleled scientific contribution, the implications of which are just beginning to emerge.</p><p>Zihlman is currently preparing a major new reference book on the comparative anatomy of greater apes for the University of California Press. She is also the author of <i>The Human Evolution Coloring Book</i>, a widely used reference and teaching tool, and coeditor of <i>The Evolving Female</i>, a book that catalyzed a rethinking of human evolution that brought females and children back to center stage.</p><p>Zihlman was elected in 1991 as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and she has served since 1993 as Science Trustee of the California Academy of Sciences. She has appeared on the cover of several popular magazines, including <i>Time</i> and <i>Discover</i>. In 1998, she gave the UCSC Faculty Research Lecture.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bd77d8072704601a012ffcf3cb9f2"><name>3061</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Caitlin Williams Freeman creates stunning desserts for SFMOMA </title><summary>Caitlin Williams Freeman whips up desserts that pay homage to SFMOMA artists.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>freeman, alumni, desserts, SFMOMA, museum,  art, artists, cake, thiebaud, mondrian, blue bottle coffee bar, san francisco, chronicle</keywords><description>Caitlin Williams Freeman whips up desserts that pay homage to SFMOMA artists.</description><start-date>1246431600000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Caitlin Williams Freeman...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3061</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3061</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338969416</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338969416</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Wayne Thiebaud's iconic paintings of luscious layer cakes have whetted the appetites of art lovers for decades.

A pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star, the dense core left behind after a supernova explosion. Most of the 1,800 known pulsars were found through their periodic radio emissions. </p><p>"These are the first pulsars ever detected by gamma rays alone, and already we've found 16," said coauthor Robert Johnson, professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "The existence of a large population of radio-quiet pulsars was suspected prior to this, but until Fermi was launched, only one radio-quiet pulsar was known, and it was first detected in x-rays." </p><p>Johnson and other physicists at UCSC's Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) identified the gamma-ray pulsars using computational techniques they developed to comb through data from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). Marcus Ziegler, a postdoctoral researcher at SCIPP and corresponding author of the paper, said detection of gamma-ray pulsations from a typical source requires weeks or months of data from the LAT. </p><p>"From the faintest pulsar we studied, the LAT sees only two gamma-ray photons a day," Ziegler said. </p><p>Of the 16 gamma-ray pulsars found by Fermi, 13 are associated with unidentified gamma-ray sources detected previously by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory. EGRET detected nearly 300 gamma-ray point sources, but was unable to detect pulsations from those sources, most of which have remained unidentified, said Pablo Saz Parkinson, also a SCIPP postdoctoral researcher and corresponding author of the paper.</p><p>"It's been a longstanding question what could be powering those unidentified sources, and the new Fermi results tell us that a lot of them are pulsars," Saz Parkinson said. "These findings are also giving us important clues about the mechanism of pulsar emissions."</p><p>A pulsar emits narrow beams of radio waves from the magnetic poles of the neutron star, and the beams sweep around like a lighthouse beacon because the magnetic poles are not aligned with the star's spin axis. If the radio beam misses the Earth, the pulsar cannot be detected by radio telescopes. Fermi's ability to detect so many radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars indicates that the gamma-rays are emitted in a beam that is wider and more fan-like than the radio beam.</p><p>"This favors models in which the gamma rays are emitted from the outer magnetosphere of the pulsar, as opposed to the polar cap much closer to the surface of the star," Saz Parkinson said.</p><p>The very intense magnetic and electric fields of a pulsar accelerate charged particles to nearly the speed of light, and these particles are ultimately responsible for the gamma-ray emissions. </p><p>Because the rotation of the star powers the emissions, isolated pulsars slow down as they age and lose energy. But a binary companion star can feed material to a pulsar and spin it up to a rotation rate of 100 to 1,000 times a second. These are called millisecond pulsars, and Fermi scientists detected gamma-ray pulsations from eight millisecond pulsars that were previously discovered at radio wavelengths. Those results are reported in a second study also published in the July 2 edition of <i>Science Express.</i></p><p>"Fermi has truly unprecedented power for discovering and studying gamma-ray pulsars," said Paul Ray of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington. "Since the demise of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory a decade ago, we've wondered about the nature of unidentified gamma-ray sources it detected in our galaxy. These studies from Fermi lift the veil on many of them."</p><p>The corresponding authors of the first paper include Ziegler, Saz Parkinson, Ray, and UCSC graduate student Michael Dormody.

<p><a href="http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/bering_sea.html">IODP Expedition 323 (Bering Sea Paleoceanography)</a> is led by co-chief scientists Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Kozo Takahashi of Kyushu University, Japan. The <a href="http://joidesresolution.org/"><em>JOIDES Resolution</em></a>, a newly equipped and modernized scientific ocean drilling vessel supported by the United States, is docked in the port of Victoria as it readies to embark on the nine-week expedition of the <a href="http://www.iodp.org">Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP)</a>.</p>
<p>While the research vessel is in port, approximately 100 undergraduate oceanography students from both the University of Victoria and Royal Roads University--prospective future participants in the IODP--will come aboard to inspect new laboratories, see how scientists work in the field, and learn the inner workings of an actual research drillship. Canadian researcher Taoufik Radi, a paleontologist and professor at University of Quebec, Montreal, represents Canada's marine research interests among the international group of research scientists on the expedition.</p>
<p>IODP Expedition 323 aims to extend the research findings of the 2004 IODP Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX 302), which drilled and collected sediment samples from the Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean. Since that investigation's conclusion, the scientific community has anticipated acquisition of new geological cores and data that address the age and effects of the Bering Strait gateway to the Arctic.</p>
<p>"The Bering Sea drilling plan is essential to our ability to decipher the history of the Bering Strait gateway and determine its impact on global and regional climatic and oceanic processes," Ravelo said. "New cores will help us understand the exchange of heat and chemical elements running through the Bering Strait, and how those may have influenced Arctic and North Pacific environments. It also will help us understand how sea ice accelerates climate change, and how subpolar ecosystems respond to climate change."</p>
<p>Planned drilling will allow penetration through sediments that scientists suspect date back through geological time to the Pliocene and possibly upper Miocene periods (approximately five million years ago). The drilling strategy is intended to help scientists capture important processes in the Bering Sea, including reconstruction of records related to sea-ice distribution and gradients.</p>
<p>After an extensive modernization, the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> returned to IODP operations in March 2009. Its first research investigation, the Pacific Equatorial Age Transect, was completed just prior to the ship's arrival in Victoria. The scientific interactions of 50 scientists on board the vessel from March to June are expected to make a substantial contribution to the knowledge of Cenozoic ocean history and global climate change.</p>
<p>The <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> is operated for IODP by the U.S. Implementing Organization (USIO) comprised of Texas A&amp;M University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.</p>
<p>IODP is supported by two lead agencies: the U.S. National Science Foundation and Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Additional program support comes from the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD, of which Canada is a member country), India's Ministry of Earth Science, the People's Republic of China (Ministry of Science and Technology), the Republic of Korea (Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources), Australia and New Zealand (Australian-New Zealand IODP Consortium). IODP's principal areas of research are climate and environmental change, solid Earth processes, and the deep biosphere.</p>

I want to update you on the status of budget planning activities on our campus and system-wide.</p><p>Later this week we expect details on the pay-reduction plan that UC's Office of the President will submit to UC Regents for consideration at next week's meeting in San Francisco. As soon as those details are available, we will share them with you.</p><p>The UCSC community contributed hundreds of comments on the three proposed pay-reduction scenarios. Chancellor Blumenthal and I were gratified to see so much thought-leadership from our campus on this important decision. A summary of campus input is available <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/ucsc-comments.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>On our campus, discussions continue each week with Academic Senate leaders, Deans, and principal officers on plans for making the expected additional $16 million in one-time and permanent cuts to our 2009-2010 budget. (These cuts do not include $12.5 million that would be realized through our portion of system-wide pay reductions.) While these decisions must be made very soon, we must also be deliberate in seeking to minimize, where possible, adverse impact on core academic programs and support services.</p><p>Today, we are convening campus academic, administrative and undergraduate and graduate student leaders in the first of three full-day budget planning sessions taking place this month. These sessions will help us develop a strategic framework for keeping UCSC moving forward in an era of declining public support. I will update you next week on our progress. </p><p>Finally, and importantly, two budget forums will be held this month to brief staff and faculty on budget issues and provide an opportunity for questions and discussion. The staff forum will take place on Thursday, July 23 from noon to 1:30 pm. A session for faculty will take place on Friday, July 31 from 2 to 3:30 pm. Both will be held in the Media Theater.

"It's great to feel their energy."</p><p>Girls in Engineering (GIE) brings sixth- through eighth-grade girls with an interest in mathematics together on campus for a unique introduction to engineering. Students from as far south as Greenfield and as far north as Boulder Creek get hands-on exposure to engineering through fun projects, such as building and programming a robot. </p><p>The program, which is free for participants and includes transportation and lunch, enables girls to imagine themselves as future engineers and exposes them to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college and career pathways. Students learn about a variety of topics, including robotics, computer science, electrical and civil engineering, applied mechanics, environmental engineering, and biomedical engineering. </p><p>Peggy Downes Baskin, wife of UCSC Foundation trustee Jack Baskin, helped create and fund GIE with $60,000 in gift support since its founding. Downes Baskin taught politics at Santa Clara University for 18 years and has also taught women's studies at UCSC.</p><p>The Baskins are longtime supporters of the campus. Their financial contributions helped establish and grow the Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC's first professional school.</p><p>Downes Baskin was the visionary for the GIE program, said Stucky. </p><p>"She noticed there was a huge disparity in the number of men compared with the number of women in field, so she decided it would be a good idea to start a program that would give more females an opportunity to learn about college and career pathways in engineering and technology," Stucky said. "She did some research and found the best age group to target is the middle school age because it's right after that that girls' interest in those fields start to fall off."</p><p>The program has also received grant support from organizations including the Cisco Foundation, the Bechtel Foundation, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. </p><p>This year, students from Branciforte, Chualar, Fairview, Lakeview, North Monterey County, Rolling Hills, San Lorenzo Valley, and Vista Verde middle schools participated. </p><p>"I sit in periodically with classes, and it's so much fun to see them working together in teams, finding groups that are really supportive of females in science and engineering," Stucky said. "It's exciting to hear them say things like, 'I never really thought that females could be in engineering, but now I know I can do anything.'"</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bf3558072704601a012ff8f070de4"><name>3075</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2009-10 Parking and Program Renewals Underway</title><start-date>1246950000000</start-date><display-name>2009-10 Parking and Program...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3075</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3075</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338976528</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338976528</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is pleased to announce that on-line renewal of parking permits and Faculty/Staff Bus Passes is now underway for the 2009-10 fiscal year.</p><p>Parking rates for the new year will remain the same for 90 percent of the campus population (those who purchase A, B, C, R, or Temporary permits). Rates will increase August 1, 2009 for the following permit types:</p><p>.  Carpool permits</p><p>.  Night permits</p><p>.  A/B "Scratcher" permits (first packet only)</p><p>The rates for several transportation programs (i.e., vanpools and the faculty/staff bus pass) will also increase.</p><p>In the programs where an increase was deemed necessary, we tried to keep them as low as possible because we recognize that everyone is impacted by the current financial crisis. Such increases were capped at 10 percent, and the bike shuttle program will remain free of charge.</p><p>These increases will help keep the TAPS program, which is designed to be self-supporting, with a balanced budget for the 2009-10 academic year. They are also consistent with the three primary objectives articulated by the campus's Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC), and supported by the Campus Welfare Committee:</p><p>.  Begin to reduce subsidies to commuter and parking programs to improve their financial sustainability;</p><p>.  Keep daytime and nighttime rates consistent; and</p><p>.  Simplify parking permit policies when possible.</p><p>Specific increases to the 2009-10 Transportation and Parking program rates include:</p><p>.  A/B "Scratcher" permit program. The first packet of 50 permits will increase $18 to $198, with additional packets costing the same. Half packets of 25 permits will increase $9 to $99, while carpool or vanpool participants will see a $12 increase for a packet of 50 ($144).</p><p>.  Close-in carpool permits. A, B, and C carpool rates will increase $3.75/month to $43.25/month, or $129.75/quarter, with the price distributed equally among members of the carpool. The ten-month carpool permit will increase by $37.50 to $432.50. This will reduce the 40 percent campus subsidy of these permits.</p><p>.  "N" Night permits. They will increase $.75/month to $9.25. Temporary Night permits will increase $1 to $3/night.</p><p>.  Faculty/Staff Bus passes. Fares will increase $3.75/month to $8.75. This will reduce the 70 percent campus subsidy of these passes.</p><p>.  Commuter Vanpools. Rates will rise between $5 and $9 per month, depending on the route. This will reduce the 70 percent campus subsidy of this program.</p><p>In addition, administrative fees will now be charged for replacing lost or stolen permits, renewing quarterly permits and passes without providing the original permit or pass, or any changes to permit types or commute programs that require a new permit or pass.</p><p>For detailed information on parking rates and access to the on-line application, please visit the TAPS home page at: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps">http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps</a></p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p> </p><p> </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915bf4a38072704601a012ff00791483"><name>3076</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC scientists warn governor on effects of state budget cuts</title><summary>More than 300 UC scientists from all 10 campuses have sent a letter to the governor warning that the proposed cuts to UC's budget will harm the future of science and technology in California and hurt the state's economy. </summary><author>Tim Stephens (831/459-2495)</author><description>More than 300 UC scientists from all 10 campuses have sent a letter to the governor warning that the proposed cuts to UC's budget will harm the future of science and technology in California and hurt the state's economy. </description><start-date>1247036400000</start-date><display-name>UC scientists warn governor...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3076</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3076</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338976874</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338976874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More than 300 UC scientists from all 10 campuses have sent a <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/news_and_events/National%20Academies%20Letter.faber.pdf">letter to the governor</a> warning that the proposed cuts to UC's budget will harm the future of science and technology in California and hurt the state's economy. </p><p>"The point of the letter is to stress the devastating effect that the proposed 19 percent budget cut for UC will have on the quality of the university," said Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p><p>Faber said the letter originated as a draft written by Mark Krumholz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and several colleagues.

<p>UCSC archaeologists and volunteers found the mother-of-pearl hair ornament and other artifacts recently in the process of excavating beneath and renovating one of the historic workers' cabins in the Cowell Lime Works Historic District at the base of campus.</p>
<p>"Finding artifacts that look like they belong to women is really interesting because it suggests women lived here, or the men who lived here had associations with women," said Sally Morgan, UCSC senior environmental planner and archaeologist.</p>
<p>UCSC staff and volunteers with the <a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu/index.shtml">Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a> are working on restoring the structures in the 30-acre district to preserve the campus's history as the largest lime-producing operation in the state. The going is slow since the effort is all volunteer and money for the restoration comes from donations and grants, but new discoveries sprout up as work progresses.</p>
<p>With the help of local restoration expert Jan Dekema, staff and volunteers have begun working on one of the remaining workers' cabins. In the 1880s, when the lime works was at its peak, at least a dozen workers' cabins flanked the road past the main entrance; now, only two are still standing.</p>
<p>The lime works was established at the campus site in the early 1850s. Lime was a key component of mortar, plaster, and whitewash, and it was used extensively in the building industries of the time. Later, Henry Cowell acquired the lime works and established more support facilities, including a self-sustaining ranch operation, at the site. The Cowell Ranch operations continued until the University of California acquired the property around 1960.</p>
<p>The former lime operations area, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, includes the Granary, now a childcare center; the Cookhouse, now the Admissions office; several barns; the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2982">Cooperage</a>, where barrels for lime shipping were made; the ruins of former workers' cabins; the Blacksmith Shop; the Carriage House, which now houses staff offices; Cardiff House, now the Women's Center but formerly the residence of lime works owner Henry Cowell; and the lime kilns themselves.</p>
<p>While Dekema painstakingly assesses and restores the cabin, aiming for a historically accurate replication of it as it stood in 1910 -- the earliest year the Friends have a photo of the structure -- Morgan and others are performing archaeological digs beneath and around it.</p>
<p>"The reason we're doing the archaeology is to try to understand what the everyday life of the workers was like," said Morgan. "There's not much record of that. So we're looking for clues to questions such as, 'Did they eat in their cabins? Did women and children live there, or just men?'"</p>
<p>The find of the hairpin suggests an answer to one of those questions. Volunteers also found the shells of clams and mussels, which could mean workers ate in their cabins.</p>
<p>"We'd thought they all ate at the Cookhouse," said Morgan.</p>
<p>Other items researchers have found beneath the cabin include buttons, overall and denim rivets, a ring, tobacco cans, embossed bottle fragments, and an 1882 nickel. Morgan emphasized that people should be around the cabins only if accompanied by the archaeology and restoration crews.</p>
<p>The restoration work includes meticulous attention to every tiny detail, such as measuring and assessing each board in the cabin to determine acceptable repair techniques, making detailed drawings before dismantling, replacing materials such as old-growth redwood in kind (using salvaged wood), and seeking a chemist on campus who can analyze a chip of whitewash from the wall of the cabin and replicate its formula.</p>
<p>One interesting detail about the cabins is there's no frame to them, only solid redwood planks, said Dekema.</p>
<p>"It's called plank and beam," he said, gesturing to the wide boards that make up the walls of the cabin. "It makes it interesting to us -- it's a very old type of construction. If this was made of modern materials, it would have disintegrated decades ago. It's a testament to the skill of the builders and the quality of the materials that it's lasted this long."</p>
<p>Dekema, Friends group president Frank Perry, and other volunteers have been working on the cabin almost every weekend, and they hope to have it ready for interpretive display by the end of the year.</p>
<p>"I really thoroughly enjoy this," Dekema said. "I never cease to be amazed by our discoveries showing how they put this together."</p>
<p>Morgan agreed.</p>
<p>"It's fascinating because it represents evolving history," she said. "Over time, the building was altered, altered, altered. You see this long historic process."</p>
<p>The same goes for the artifacts under the cabin's floor, Morgan said.</p>
<p>"You think, if that artifact could talk ..." she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>At the corner of 13th and Franklin Streets in downtown Oakland, a worn bronze plaque hangs on the wall of a two-story parking garage. Easy to miss, state Historical Marker No. 45 identifies the spot where, 140 years ago, a California miracle began. Here the University of California spent its infancy, occupying a two-story Victorian that had housed one of the state's first colleges. In 1873 the university - after graduating an original class of 12 - migrated to Berkeley and began its rise as a land-grant college dedicated to teaching agriculture, mining and the mechanical arts.</p>

The enterprise, of course, has endured, and then some. Under the stewardship of some great leaders, and with the support of alumni like you and, for that matter, all of California, the University has grown from its humble origins to the point where it now stretches all across the state, from Merced to Santa Barbara, Riverside to San Francisco, Irvine to Santa Cruz, San Diego to Davis, Los Angeles to Berkeley - 10 campuses, five medical centers, three national laboratories, 225,000 students, 55 Nobel Prizes and 1.6 million alumni.<br/>
<br/>
<p>It is to that great army of alumni, along with other friends and beneficiaries of the University of California, that we write today, and we do so with a sense of great urgency - to ask you to become engaged as never before in building legislative and financial support for this great institution.</p>
<p>This is a time of peril for the University we all love.</p>
<p>The UC model - providing universal access to a top-notch, low-cost education and research of the highest caliber - continues to be studied around the globe among those who would emulate its success. And yet, this model has been increasingly abandoned at home by the state government responsible for its core funding.</p>
<p>In the past 20 years, the amount of money allotted to the University through the state budget has fallen dramatically: General Fund support for a UC student stood at $15,860 in 1990. If current budget projections hold, it will drop this year to $7,680.</p>
<p>Moreover, it now appears likely the UC system, in this current fiscal crisis, will be ordered by Sacramento to absorb yet another $800-plus million in additional cuts. Its 2009-10 core budget will be reduced by an estimated 20 percent. This will bring the amount of state investment in the University down to $2.4 billion - exactly where it was in real dollars a decade ago.</p>
<p>In the same time frame, by the way, funding for state prisons has more than doubled, from $5 to $11 billion. It's been reported that, based on current spending trends, California's prison budget soon will overtake that of the state's universities and community colleges.</p>
<p>And so, our work is cut out for us. As one Chairman of the Board of Regents steps down and another takes over, we are asking you, as stewards of UC, to step up and help arrest this slide of support, as quickly as possible. It's often said that it takes 40 years to build up a great university, but only a few to tear one down.</p>
<p>Elected officials in Sacramento who control our core budget must be asked to re-examine their priorities when it comes to future higher education funding. They also need to understand that a fiscal crisis is precisely the wrong time to be putting the pinch on education. Consider what Thomas Friedman of the New York Times wrote in a recent column:</p>
<p>". The country that uses this crisis to make its population smarter and more innovative - and endows its people with more tools and basic research to invent new goods and services - is the one that will not just survive but thrive down the road. We might be able to stimulate our way back to stability, but we can only invent our way back to prosperity. We need everyone at every level to get smarter."</p>
<p>The core money UC receives from taxpayers, via Sacramento, goes to the nuts and bolts of higher education, everything from paying professors to lighting laboratories. But it also establishes the institutional foundation needed to attract the research grants and endowments that enhance the mission and burnish the University's international status.</p>
<p>Over time it's been money well-spent. Of the more than 4,000 higher education institutions in the nation, only 60 research universities, public and private, have been judged worthy of membership in the prestigious Association of American Universities. The UC has six members. No other state system has more than one.</p>
<p>In turn, the University has given back to California, not only by educating generations of high-achieving Californians, but also through its triumphs of research. From better ways to grow tomatoes to the birth of biotech, from viticulture to cancer treatments, UC campuses have been incubators of countless scientific and product breakthroughs that add quality to California life and invigorate its economy. For 15 years in a row, UC has developed more patents than any other university in the country.</p>
<p>This is what's put at risk as state support shrinks. In the end, there are two choices: excellence or mediocrity. While a mediocre UC might cost less in the short term, over time it will enforce on society its own ledger of taxes. Top professors and researchers will begin to drift away, taking with them the best students. Pools of grant money will recede. The engines of invention will sputter.</p>
<p>To those who complain the university has been bloated, wasteful, we say this is a new day. In the last few years, we have seen the institution reform itself. Under a new administration, it is setting new standards for transparency and leadership. We've worked hard to maintain strong bond ratings, cut spending in the Office of the President by $60 million, and taken additional cost-cutting measures at the campus level. But there is only so much that can be cut. We are no longer chopping at fat and muscle. With the new cuts, as proposed, we soon will be slicing into bone.</p>
<p>And so, there is much at stake and the threat is real. Now is the time for alumni and other supporters and beneficiaries of the University to spread the word that UC excellence must be preserved and nurtured. Please, do whatever you can. Take time to write a letter or an e-mail to your political representatives. Or lend whatever support possible to the UC system or to your preferred campus.</p>
<p>The message - not in just this current crisis, but into the future as well - must be clear: A just-good-enough University of California would not be good enough at all. Mediocrity is not an option. It's time to start fighting back for the UC.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to address you this morning about the budget impact at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>That UC faces daunting challenges and painful choices is all too obvious. The ultimate question is whether we will confront these challenges with incremental actions, or whether we will do it with clarity, creativity, and conviction.</p>

I want to state, very clearly, that we understand that everyone must share in the pain and contribute to the solution. But, we will not compromise on UCSC's mission to be a leading public research university.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The Santa Cruz campus has been on a sustained upward trajectory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attracting increasingly diverse, exceptional students and top-notch faculty who are leaders in their fields;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Achieving research impact, as measured by citations, and when adjusted for size, next only to Harvard, Caltech and MIT;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Acquiring new highs in both federal and private support;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Unearthing solutions to vexing challenges to human health and the environment;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Linking the arts and humanities with engineering to create new fields of study and; <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Leading an innovative public, private partnership as the UC of Silicon Valley.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Our impact - however one measures it - is extraordinary. So is the fiscal crisis we face.</p>
<p>Even after accounting for increased student fees, our operating budget has declined by $50 million since mid-2008. That's more than $3,000 per student.</p>
<p>We cannot sustain cuts like these without making major changes. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>We've reduced our next frosh class by more than 750 students. If this trend continues, it would effectively shut the door of opportunity to thousands of qualified students at UC Santa Cruz alone. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>We've eliminated 55 faculty positions - 8 percent of budgeted faculty - and dramatically reduced the number of lecturers and teaching assistants. This year we must defer nearly all faculty recruitments. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>There will be fewer courses available. For some students this means longer time to graduation. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>There will be less academic support. We have already cut library hours, slashed book acquisitions, and suspended subscriptions to scholarly journals. There will also be fewer academic advisors.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>And, while I reluctantly support the need for pay reductions, these actions make our campus, our university and our state vulnerable to a rapid "brain drain."</p>
<p>Here's the brutal truth: Fewer of California's best and brightest students will enjoy the rich educational opportunities and experiences available to previous generations of UC students.</p>
<p>Some may say, that's too bad. I say, that's a tragedy.</p>
<p>Our research programs are threatened:</p>

<ul>
<li>We've eliminated several strong and promising research units - including the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Policy, and Society) and the Institute for Science and Global Policy. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>We're looking at seriously reducing research budgets in other units - UCO Lick Observatory is just one example.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Because of these cuts, we have to wonder: How many innovations, how many vaccines and human health breakthroughs, how many ways to protect our planet from climate change, will be delayed or undiscovered?</p>
<p>We've heard the charge that all UC needs to do is reduce administrative operations. Our campus has already streamlined academic support operations and consolidated business functions. We've invested in information technology to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>We've tried to protect the academic enterprise. Two years of cuts have eaten far more deeply into administration, which took two-thirds of cuts compared with teaching or research.</p>
<p>We have eliminated 160 administrative positions from the front-line to the top, including several high-level management jobs.</p>
<p>But as cuts continue, our options have narrowed. Now the cuts are becoming more devastating - fundamentally threatening student access and academic quality.</p>
<p>This is not a one- or two-year problem. The impacts of the cuts made today will have repercussions for years to come. I may be stating the obvious, but it bears repeating: These are not mere budget cuts. California is fundamentally "disinvesting" in higher education.</p>
<p>Our greatest challenge, then, is to prevent these circumstances from derailing our progress. We must - and will - continue to be strategic. Creative. And focused. There is too much at stake to do anything less.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Interior secretary Ken Salazar also announced his endorsement of McNutt for the position. </p><p>McNutt has led MBARI since 1997 and joined the UCSC faculty in 1998. She would be the first woman director of USGS since its establishment in 1879. The nomination is subject to Senate confirmation. </p><p>"It is a distinct honor to be asked by the President to serve his administration, especially given the high caliber of science appointments already made," McNutt said in a prepared statement. "Scientific information from the U.S. Geological Survey is crucial to solving the most important problems facing society--finding sufficient supplies of fresh water and clean energy, and providing accurate information that allows citizens to prepare intelligently for climate change. I look forward to leading such a respected institution at this critical time."</p><p>Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC, said McNutt is a superb choice as director of USGS. "She is an accomplished and respected geophysicist and has provided strong and innovative leadership to MBARI for a decade," Griggs said. "She is an excellent communicator and a natural leader. The nation and Earth sciences would be very well served with Marcia as the director of the Geological Survey."</p><p>McNutt studied geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, where she earned a Ph.D. in Earth sciences. Her research includes studies of ocean island volcanism in French Polynesia, continental break-up in the Western United States, and uplift of the Tibet Plateau. She has participated in 15 major oceanographic expeditions, and served as chief scientist on more than half of those voyages. </p><p>McNutt served as president of the American Geophysical Union from 2000 to 2002. She also chaired the President's Panel on Ocean Exploration, convened by President Clinton to examine the possibility of initiating a major U.S. program in exploring the oceans. She was chair of the Board of Governors for Joint Oceanographic Institutions and is a trustee of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. She also chairs the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c06d58072704601a012ff72055af7"><name>3087</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor Blumenthal describes budget impacts at Regents meeting</title><summary>Speaking at today's meeting of the UC Board of Regents, Chancellor George Blumenthal described the impact that two years of budget cuts are having on the UCSC campus.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><description>Speaking at today's meeting of the UC Board of Regents, Chancellor George Blumenthal described the impact that two years of budget cuts are having on the UCSC campus.</description><start-date>1247641200000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor Blumenthal describes budget...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3087</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3087</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338981539</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338981539</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Speaking at today's meeting of the UC Board of Regents, Chancellor George Blumenthal described the impact that two years of budget cuts are having on the UCSC campus.

Faber represented the more than 300 UC scientists from all 10 campuses who sent a letter to the governor warning that the proposed cuts to UC's budget will harm the future of science and technology in California and hurt the state's economy. In addition to addressing the board today, Faber presented Regents with a "white paper" summarizing the scientists' concerns.</p><p>Mark Krumholz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, authored the first draft of the letter to the governor.

The NSF program recognizes "junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research." Ramirez-Ruiz won another prestigious award last year, a Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering.</p><p>His NSF project, titled "Compact Objects in the Era of Celestial Cinematography," will analyze how the interplay between compact objects and other stars could yield clues to the properties of these extreme forms of matter. Compact objects are created when normal stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse, shedding their outer layers (sometimes in a spectacular supernova explosion) and leaving behind an extremely dense core. Such a remnant is difficult to observe directly, but collisions with other stars or the transfer of matter from a gravitationally bound companion star can make these otherwise invisible objects light up, Ramirez-Ruiz said. </p><p>"These interactions could yield observations which, when compared to the results of computer simulations, provide firm conclusions about the nature of compact objects," he said.</p><p>The comprehensive numerical modeling of encounters between stars requires a suite of computer software codes to treat the diverse range of physics and timescales at play. The requirements include realistic treatments of nuclear physics, radiation transport, general relativity, and hydrodynamics. So far, most work in the field has been piecemeal, with different groups addressing individual aspects of the problem, said Ramirez-Ruiz. His goal over the duration of the grant is to develop a theoretical framework that will allow complete models to be built for a wide variety of stellar encounters.</p><p>Ramirez-Ruiz's proposal for the CAREER award also includes an education and public-outreach program designed to increase the retention and graduation rates for Hispanic students enrolled in a two-year college. He plans to join forces with the faculty and staff of Hartnell Community College in Salinas to identify potential transfer students who show promise as researchers and are members of groups traditionally underrepresented at UCSC. Key components of the program include intensive research instruction through summer internships, academic counseling and mentoring, and workshops that integrate family members. The goal is to promote diversity while increasing the number of students who attend and graduate from UCSC with degrees in physics.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c0a048072704601a012ff547d4484"><name>3089</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on salary reductions, budget planning </title><summary>In a budget update following the UC Board of Regents approval of a salary reduction plan Thursday, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger described  actions the campus is taking to contend with a drastic loss of resources from the state. </summary><description>In a budget update following the UC Board of Regents approval of a salary reduction plan Thursday, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger described  actions the campus is taking to contend with a drastic loss of resources from the state. </description><start-date>1247727600000</start-date><display-name>Update on salary reductions,...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3089</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3089</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338982349</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338982349</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Today, the UC Board of Regents declared an extreme financial emergency and approved President Yudof's proposal for staff and faculty salary reductions effective September 1. This afternoon, President Yudof issued a letter to all UC employees, which may be viewed at <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/"> www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/ </a>.</p><p>The pay reduction will reduce the total amount we will need to cut from our 2009-2010 budget. Previously, we've estimated the savings from pay reductions to be in the range of $12 million; the actual amount will be determined once all implementation details have been worked out. President Yudof's letter provides additional context.</p><p>Additionally, we still need to make further significant cuts, in both permanent and one-time funds, from the 2009-2010 budget. And we need to anticipate the possibility of even deeper cuts in 2010-2011 and beyond.  The magnitude and permanent nature of these cuts will have a major impact on UCSC now and in the future.</p><p>In the wake of the Regents' action, I want to update you on how we are developing a strategic plan to operate the campus with fewer resources.  </p><p>This month, my office is holding three budget planning meetings with administrative officers, deans, key Academic Senate leaders, and student representatives.  The first was held on July 7.  Our key goal was to understand the size of the budget challenge and define timelines and a process for consultations regarding budget cuts in the context of our overall institutional goals and aspirations for the campus.  We are working to create a budget-planning process within a flexible and consultative framework that considers every decision, including near-term ones, in the larger context of UCSC as an excellent, diverse research university with high-quality educational experiences. </p><p>The second budget retreat is scheduled for tomorrow, July 17, where we will consider an overall framework for the actions we must take, recognizing the need for urgency. At the final session, divisions will present possible scenarios to accommodate cuts, and we will discuss what consultations will need to take place before decisions are made to implement these scenarios. </p><p>In order to present more information about the budget situation and to answer your questions, two budget forums are scheduled to brief employees on the challenges we face and provide an opportunity for questions and discussion. A forum for staff will be Thursday, July 23, from 12:00 noon to 1:30 p.m. A session for academic employees will be Friday, July 31, from 2:00 to 3:30 p.m. Both will be held in the Media Theater. </p><p>In closing, I want to acknowledge the many comments and suggestions the Chancellor and I received after my last budget message. We will continue to communicate with you regularly so that you can understand the magnitude of these budget issues and provide insight and comments as we move forward.

<p>The four programs-all directed by UCSC faculty-will be funded for a total of $6.3 million over a five-year period, with each of the programs expending effort on multiple UC campuses.</p>
<p>The MRPI awards are based on excellence of research, competitiveness and innovation, and the impact and benefits of the programs to the UC system.</p>
<p>They are presented to collaborative research projects that involve three or more campuses, and to programs that focus on topics important to both UC and the state of California.</p>
<p>Of the 28 awards conferred, UC San Francisco and UC Irvine joined UCSC in receiving four awards, UC Berkeley and UC San Diego earned three, and UC Davis, two. UC Santa Barbara was the top award-winner with a total of five.</p>
<p>"We are delighted at the success of our UCSC faculty in winning these programs in the face of intense competition across the 10 UC campuses," noted Bruce Margon, UCSC vice chancellor for research.</p>
<p>"We have always considered one of UCSC's greatest strengths as bringing front-line, internationally recognized research to our students in a small, intimate environment, and this is just the latest example," said Margon.</p>
<p>"We're particularly pleased that these new centers will span not just the technical fields, but also the humanities and social sciences, reflecting the broad diversity of our campus programs," he added.</p>
<p>UCSC garnered two awards for proposals in the Humanities, one in the area of Emerging Sciences &amp; Technology, and one in the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>The following programs received awards:</p>
<p>. <strong>High Performance AstroComputing Center</strong>-directed by physics professor Joel Primack</p>
<p>. <strong>Collaborative Research for an Equitable California</strong>-co-directed by education professor Rodney Ogawa and associate education professor Ronald Glass</p>
<p>. <strong>Pacific Rim Research Program</strong>-directed by history professor Gail Hershatter</p>
<p>. <strong>Mediterranean Studies Multi-Campus Research Project</strong>-co-directed by associate history professor Brian Catlos and literature professor Sharon Kinoshita</p>

<p>The <strong>High Performance AstroComputing Center</strong> (HIPACC) will focus on computational astrophysics-using the growing power of supercomputers to address the most difficult problems in astrophysics and cosmology.</p>
<p>The purpose of the center is to realize the full potential of UC's groundbreaking computational astrophysicists by enhancing their interactions with each other and their use of data. This multidisciplinary effort will link theoretical and observational astrophysicists, physicists, Earth and planetary scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists at nine UC campuses and three national laboratories.</p>
<p>"Individual UC and lab teams are fairly well funded, but we do not routinely share knowledge, postdocs, students, or computing resources," noted UCSC professor of physics Joel Primack, who will direct the center. "Because of our broad and complementary expertise, much can be gained by promoting cross-fertilization and also by fostering a tradition of systemwide collaborations."</p>
<p>The <strong>Collaborative Research for an Equitable California</strong> (CREC) program will bring together university researchers with community organizations and policymakers to tackle the state's interconnected crises in education, employment, health, nutrition, housing, and the environment.</p>
<p>"Historically, the university has done research in education, in health care, in housing, in economic development-we want to begin where all these crises intersect," said Ronald Glass, UCSC associate professor of education who will co-direct the center with fellow education professor, Rodney Ogawa. "It's not an accident that kids who don't eat well and don't have good health care don't do very well in school."</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary center will establish long-term research sites around the state, ultimately growing to seven sites including one on the U.S. border with Mexico, said Glass. The goal of the center is to prepare a new generation of scholars in the social, behavioral, health, and natural sciences who are skilled in working with community-based entities, government agencies, and policymakers, and to generate strategic interventions that will benefit California.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pacific Rim Research Program</strong> (PRRP) funds research that increases our understanding of how regions are made and unmade, and how societies envision their futures. Administered as a systemwide program for the past 23 years, the program will now be housed on the UCSC campus under the direction of history professor Gail Hershatter.</p>
<p>PRRP provides grants for scholars from every UC campus to conduct cutting-edge research in and about the Pacific Rim. Investigations range from economics to the environment, migration to artistic innovation, and resource utilization to public health. This research continues to help Pacific Rim nations and peoples cooperate in confronting the challenges facing the region.</p>
<p>"California's connections across the region are longstanding and complex, and the knowledge we produce about the Pacific Rim is important in understanding our intertwined past and shaping our shared future," said Hershatter. She added that grants made this coming year will support research on responses to crisis in the Pacific Rim, as well as funding advanced graduate student research.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mediterranean Studies</strong> project will integrate UCSC's long-standing Mediterranean Studies initiative-which includes campus-based activities and an NEH Summer Institute for College and University Professors-with programs at eight other UC campuses to collaborate on a wide range of research and curricular projects.</p>
<p>Mediterranean Studies is an emerging interdisciplinary field that is part of the trend towards oceanic studies, environmental history, and the re-thinking of regional and national models of study in such fields as history, literature, art history, religious studies, political science, and anthropology. At present, 50 UC faculty have committed to the project, as well as nearly 100 associate scholars across the U.S., Canada, and Europe.</p>
<p>"The Mediterranean is of particular importance as an area of origin for religions, a shared community of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, and a historical place of exchange between Africa, Europe and Asia," said UCSC associate history professor Brian Catlos, who will co-direct the program with UCSC literature professor Sharon Kinoshita.</p>

<p>In collaboration with NCCEP, CollegeEd presented these awards to parents who have demonstrated a significant commitment and leadership in their local GEAR UP initiative and school community.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz GEAR UP is a school/college consortium project supported by federal grant and university funds that serves 5,100 students in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties.</p>
<p>Maria Vargas has only been involved with GEAR UP for just under two years but has already had an impact on local children and families. Upon her realization that her attitude and actions as a mother impacted her children's academic performance, Maria was inspired to educate herself so that she could be a true role model to her own children as well as to the other children in her community. Since then, Maria has been very active in her children's school and community. She organized local parents to write a grant to develop a parent patrol and went through the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center's three-tier Parent Leadership training.</p>
<p>In just 18 short months, Ms. Vargas has been transformed from a parent into a parent leader who speaks passionately in front of audiences that include superintendents, school administrators, teachers and students about the importance of GEAR UP and of family involvement. She is now educating parents on college access, facilitating workshops on parent advocacy and sharing her own story to inspire other parents to become involved with their own children's education and with GEAR UP.</p>
<p>Maria Carmen Vargas, GEAR UP/EPC Parent Leader at UCSC said the following about her experience:</p>
<p><u>in English</u>: "From EPC and GEAR UP, I learned that when I value and respect that I am and seek out opportunities to grow, I, in turn, can value, respect, and support others including my children and community. Before, I believed, like many other parents in Greenfield that a university education was only for those that could afford it. Now, I believe that a university education is for all those that want to fight for this dream no matter where they are or in what situation they find themselves in. Today, as I see the positive results my change has had in my children, I am very happy to share this great news with my community."</p>
<p><u>en EspaÃ±ol</u>: "Del programa GEAR UP/EPC he aprendido que al valorarme, respetarme y capacitarme puedo entonces valorar, respetar y apoyar a otros incluyendo mis hijos y mi comunidad. Yo antes pensaba -como muchos otros padres en Greenfield- que la universidad es solo para los que tienen dinero. Ahora pienso que la universidad es para todo aquel que quiera luchar por este sueÃ±o, no importa el lugar donde este ni la situaciÃ³n en la que se encuentre. Ahora, al ver los resultados en mis hijos, sencillamente, me hace feliz compartir esta buena noticia con mi comunidad."</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to have one of the more than fifty college pathways parent leaders we have developed in six local communities be chosen for this national award. These parents are providing information to parents who might not otherwise receive information to help their children build college aspirations," notes Carrol Moran, executive director of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center.</p>

<p>Bernabe is one of only 30 students selected nationally to be a first-time attendee at the Summit. All participants in the National Youth Leadership Summit are students from schools served by Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), a federal program designed to increase the number of low-income youth who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. Students are selected in a competitive application process based on their academic achievement, leadership experience, essay, and letters of recommendation.</p>
<p>Over the course of the Summit, students work collectively to create a report focused on what educators should consider when designing strategies and programs aimed at improving student achievement; as well as help business and community leaders, policy makers, and educators understand the issues that students believe to be important for improving student success and strengthening the education system as a whole. The culmination of the Summit is the students' presentation of the report to the over 2,000 attendees of the NCCEP/GEAR UP Annual Conference.</p>
<p>Bernabe is ranked seven in her class of 561 students and is enrolled in rigorous courses such as honors chemistry, accelerated English, the math academy and advanced algebra and trigonometry. Since the eighth grade she has been very involved in her community and has participated in the Summer Youth Leadership Conference held at UC Santa Cruz for the past two years.</p>
<p>Mayra Bernabe is a participant in the UCSC Educational Partnership Center GEAR UP program. In collaboration with schools and districts in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, the Educational Partnership Center is implementing three GEAR UP partnership programs to build college-bound communities through academic preparation and increased awareness about college-going pathways.</p>

Ellen died on Friday, July 10, following a short illness.</p><p>Ellen's first involvement with UCSC was as a student, having the distinction of being a member of Cowell College's founding class of 1965.  She later became a staff member at Oakes College, where she worked as a housing coordinator during the early 1990s.  She left UCSC for a short time and returned to campus to work in the Mathematics Department in 1995, where she worked for the past 14 years.</p><p>Ellen provided extraordinary service to her Department, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and the many graduate students whose lives she profoundly impacted by her mentoring, wise counsel and good humor over the years.  Those who had the privilege of working closely with Ellen were indeed fortunate to have had her as a colleague and a friend.</p><p>A memorial service is currently being planned for a later time.</p><p>Please join me in expressing our sincere condolences to Ellen's husband Jim, their children and grandchildren, and her many family members, colleagues and friends. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Steve Thorsett, Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c13ca8072704601a012ff7f6cd24f"><name>3095</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>History professor Dana Frank was quoted in a number of news outlets and blogs about early elections in Honduras.</summary><description>History professor Dana Frank was quoted in a number of news outlets and blogs about early elections in Honduras.</description><start-date>1248073200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3095</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3095</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338984850</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338984850</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>History professor Dana Frank was quoted in a number of news outlets and blogs about a letter from 35 U.S. experts on Latin America asking Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to permit early elections in Honduras, including <strong>La Tribuna</strong> (Honduras), <strong>El Canario7</strong> (Canary Islands), <strong>ADN</strong> (Madrid), <strong>El Financiero</strong> (Mexico City), <strong>El Diario CoLatino.com</strong> (San Salvador), and the online German magazine <strong>Telepolis.</strong> Frank also had a new op-ed piece syndicated online by <strong>New American Media</strong> in both English and Spanish.

The new rates represent a one quarter of one percent (.0025) increase in the old tax rates. For example, if the old rate was 1.0%, the new rate is 1.25%.</p><p>In order to accommodate the rate changes, the Payroll Personnel System (PPS) has to reprogram the tax table structure to accommodate an additional data space that the new tax rates require. The revised rates apply to all earnings in 2009, beginning January 1, 2009, and it is possible that you may owe taxes at the end of the year.</p><p>To determine if you will need to increase the amount of state tax withheld in order to avoid owing taxes at the end of the year, please review the California State Form DE-4 "Employee Withholding Allowance Certificate" available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/cao/paycoord/ucw4-de4.pdf">http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/cao/paycoord/ucw4-de4.pdf</a></p><p>This form includes instructions about estimating state income tax liability on an annual basis using the new tax rates.</p><p>If you determine that you will not have enough state income tax withheld, you can increase the amount of your state income tax withholding by:</p><p>.

<p>In their first task after the historic moon walk by Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 astronauts placed the Lunar Ranging RetroReflector (LRRR) on the moon, recalls research astronomer Remington Stone of Lick Observatory in a first-person account of the project.</p>
<p>The device, "an array of 100 beautiful corner cube prisms," was cut to return any inbound light exactly back to the source, writes Stone.</p>
<p>But Stone, who was selected to operate the telescope during the experiment, describes being "at the center of the first difficulty, which was that we could not find the moon with the world's second largest telescope!"</p>

The burn date is subject to change, depending on weather conditions, resource availability, and fire activity in the region. (See CAL FIRE <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/pdf/2009_marshallfieldburn.pdf">press release</a>.)</p><p>As currently planned, the burn would begin at 9 a.m. and is expected to last most of the day.</p><p>Marshall Field, located at the northern end of the UCSC campus, and the upper portion of Wilder Ranch will be closed to the public during the activity. There may be minor traffic delays on Empire Grade during the burn.</p><p>Smoke will be visible but is not cause for alarm. As with any controlled burn in the vicinity of UCSC, however, there is a possibility of smoke affecting the campus. Those who may encounter health problems related to smoke exposure should take appropriate precautions.</p><p>Controlled burns are one of the tools CAL FIRE uses to assist landowners with habitat maintenance and reduction of fire hazard. Burning under prescribed conditions is beneficial for coastal grassland habitats to reduce non-native species and increase the abundance and diversity of California grasses and wildflowers.</p><p>For updated information on the schedule of this burn, please contact Angela Bernheisel, CAL FIRE's vegetation management program coordinator, at (831) 335-6794.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Jeff Trapp, Fire Chief</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c1dc68072704601a012ffa1bc38db"><name>3101</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Faber leads faculty push to preserve UC luster</title><summary>World-renowned UCSC astronomer Sandra Faber has become the face and voice of faculty concerned about the future of UC amid the recent painful state budget cuts.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sandra Faber, Mark Krumholz, budget cuts</keywords><description>World-renowned UCSC astronomer Sandra Faber has become the face and voice of faculty concerned about the future of UC amid the recent painful state budget cuts.</description><start-date>1248246000000</start-date><display-name>Faber leads faculty push...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3101</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3101</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338987398</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338987398</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/07/images/faber.sandra.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/07/images/faber.sandra.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faber.sandra.300.jpg</name><file-size>20274</file-size><width>300</width><height>257</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sandra Faber worked with other prominent UC faculty to speak out on the effects recent severe budget cuts will have on UC.

Arnold Schwarzenegger decrying the cuts and describing how they will destroy UC's standing, delay economic recovery for the state, and cause faculty salaries to be nearly 20 percent below market rate. The letter was signed by 300 UC professors who are members of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. </p><p>The missive originated as a draft written by Mark Krumholz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and several colleagues. </p><p>The letter began because of "a feeling that we were seeing the university fall apart before our eyes and we wanted to say or do something about it," said Krumholz. "We wanted to point out to the administration, the Legislature, and the governor that defunding UC has consequences. The University of California isn't a luxury that in bad times you cut back on -- it's an investment that produces long-term returns." </p><p>Faber edited the letter and then worked with UC Berkeley astronomer Chris McKee to gather signatures from other top UC scientists.</p><p>"I thought that if professors didn't speak up for UC, clearly people will think we don't care," Faber said, explaining her leadership in the letter campaign while sitting in her sunny office in UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics on a recent weekday morning. </p><p>Faber also wanted those in her department to know she'd fought for them if and when they began considering offers from competitors. </p><p>"I wanted to lay a foundation of credibility with my own troops," Faber said. </p><p>At their July 15 meeting, the UC Regents approved an emergency measure proposed by President Mark Yudof to institute furloughs and pay cuts for UC staff and faculty. Faber spoke before the Regents at the meeting, saying UC's future is in jeopardy because it's already struggling to attract and retain the top-rung academics the university depends on. </p><p>Faber also told the Regents that the furlough plan should be a one-year term only. Any longer, and key faculty will be lured away by competing institutions that can afford to pay them better, creating a "brain drain" from the University of California and permanently tarnishing its standards, prominence, and reputation. </p><p>Krumholz thinks even the one-year furlough will spark faculty flight, since private institutions and other state universities could attempt to raid UC faculty in an effort to raise their standings.  </p><p>The media have reported widely on Faber's efforts; she's been quoted in newspapers including the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and the <i>San Jose Mercury News,</i> and was featured on NPR's Morning Edition. </p><p>No stranger to media attention -- a few years ago, Faber served on a National Academy panel that considered the controversial question of whether or not the Hubble telescope should be repaired one more time -- the astronomer said the latest round with the media has been "energizing." </p><p>"It's extremely entertaining," Faber said. "Every second is something new. I've always enjoyed experiences that teach me things and cause me to learn and grow." </p><p>The next step, she said, is to go to Sacramento and talk to legislators, working to influence policy. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c1f6e8072704601a012ffa654a0fe"><name>3102</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Budget cuts will make for a different UCSC</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz, faculty, students, and staff worry about the impact the state's financial meltdown is having on the campus, and will have on the social and economic health of the state.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>budget cuts</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz, faculty, students, and staff worry about the impact the state's financial meltdown is having on the campus, and will have on the social and economic health of the state.</description><start-date>1248418800000</start-date><display-name>Budget cuts will make...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3102</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3102</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338987798</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338987798</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/07/images/budget.vise.grip.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/07/images/budget.vise.grip.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>budget.vise.grip.300.jpg</name><file-size>14525</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As California works to plug an epic budget shortfall, severe budget cuts are threatening the twin qualities -- excellence and access -- that have defined the University of California as the world's leading public research university.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, faculty, students, and staff worry about the impact the state's financial meltdown is having on the campus, and will have on the social and economic health of the state.</p>
<p>"The first order of impact will be that students will have to get to class early to get a seat," said Quentin Williams, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences and outgoing chair of UCSC's Academic Senate, outlining effects that he says students will feel as early as this fall. "There will be fewer classes offered, and class sizes will be larger."</p>
<p>The repercussions of California's $26.3 billion budget gap are being felt campuswide. For example, the University Library has reduced hours and staffing and is canceling almost $800,000 worth of serial subscriptions, among other measures, according to University Librarian Ginny Steel.</p>
<p>"We're down to core services at this point," Steel said.</p>
<p><strong>'Staggering' cuts reaching 20 percent of state-funded budget</strong></p>
<p>As of mid-July, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and California legislators had reached a tentative agreement on how to close the state's budget gap. UC officials were bracing for an $813 million systemwide reduction in support from the state's General Fund. A student fee increase, an employee <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/yudof_furlough_proposal.pdf">furlough plan</a>, and other steps were expected to close the gap by about $500 million; the remainder -- more than $300 million -- will come from another round of cuts spread across the university's 10 campuses.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3101">effort spearheaded by UCSC faculty</a>, more than 300 UC scientists issued a letter and white paper warning Gov. Schwarzenegger that the steep funding cuts endanger UC's position as the premier public university in the United States and could imperil California's future economic growth.</p>
<p>For students, knowing that tuition is rising while opportunities and services are decreasing doesn't seem fair.</p>
<p>"I love this school. I fundraise a lot of money for this school," said senior Nick Thorwaldson, 20, who works as a student supervisor for UCSC's telemarketing program. "But why is our tuition being raised 9 percent while at the same time we're getting less? That doesn't make any sense to me."</p>
<p>Campus officials call the cuts -- now totaling approximately $50 million in the past year -- "staggering." They amount to approximately 20 percent of the state-funded portion of UCSC's budget.</p>

<p>In his remarks to the UC Board of Regents at their July 15 meeting in San Francisco, Chancellor George Blumenthal described the impacts to quality and access. Because of budget reductions <em>already</em> imposed, he said, the campus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expects to reduce its incoming freshman class by more than 750 students. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Has eliminated 55 vacant faculty positions -- 8 percent of budgeted faculty -- and dramatically reduced the number of lecturers and teaching assistants. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Has reduced its academic and administrative staff ranks by 160. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Is reducing expenditures in every area of the campus.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Here's the brutal truth: Fewer of California's best and brightest students will enjoy the rich educational opportunities and experiences available to previous generations of UC students," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p><strong>Academic impact, both short and long term</strong></p>
<p>Already, the campus has eliminated several strong and promising research units, including the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research, and it is looking at seriously reducing research budgets in other units.</p>
<p>"Because of these cuts, we have to wonder: How many innovations, how many vaccines and human health breakthroughs, how many ways to protect our planet from climate change will be delayed or undiscovered?" Blumenthal asked during his presentation to the Regents. "These are not mere budget cuts. California is fundamentally 'disinvesting' in higher education."</p>
<p>To date, no academic majors have been eliminated because of budget cuts. While Williams thinks some will eventually disappear, that's not a process that can happen quickly or affect students already enrolled in or admitted into those fields.</p>
<p>"But it's an inevitable consequence of the trajectory we're on," he said. "We will have to look very carefully at the portfolio of majors we offer."</p>
<p>In April, when UCSC's Social Sciences Division was implementing its share of the campus's then-$13 million budget cut, officials proposed reductions in every department within the division.</p>
<p>One of those departments was Community Studies, and reports soon emerged that the major was being shuttered. While the Social Sciences dean quickly <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2835">corrected that misimpression</a>, the program's fiscal difficulties underscored the campuswide challenge of preserving the breadth and quality of UCSC's academic offerings.</p>
<p>"Community Studies, for example, is going to have to figure out how deliver that major more affordably," Williams said. "That's something they have to work through over the coming academic year. Will it look like it did last year? Probably not."</p>
<p>One minor in the Arts Division experienced a more certain outcome: Offered by the Music Department, the Western Art Music minor will accept no new students beginning this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Where does UCSC go from here?</strong></p>
<p>For Chancellor Blumenthal, what's at stake are those two qualities that attracted him to UCSC as a faculty member 37 years ago.</p>
<p>"As cuts continue, our options have narrowed," he told Regents. "Now the cuts are becoming more devastating -- fundamentally threatening student access and academic quality."</p>
<p>UCSC junior Cortney Kammerer, 20, has two friends who won't be returning to school in the fall because of the higher fees.</p>
<p>"It's interesting being a student right now," Kammerer said. "The first year, you thought everything was secure. Now, though I'm so appreciative and thankful to have gotten into a UC, I feel like my education won't be as highly credited as before the budget cuts."</p>
<p>Blumenthal and Campus Provost Kliger have convened budget-planning sessions this month in an effort to "develop a strategic framework for keeping UCSC moving forward in an era of declining public support."</p>
<p>"The Santa Cruz campus," Blumenthal reminded Regents, "has been on a sustained upward trajectory. Our greatest challenge is to prevent these circumstances from derailing our progress. We must -- and will -- continue to be strategic. Creative. And focused. There is too much at stake to do anything less."</p>

The evidence is everywhere: When the City of Santa Cruz issued water restrictions this spring, for example, UCSC was directed to reduce water use by 15 percent. One month later, campus water use had dropped by a 27 percent.</p><p>That responsiveness to city mandates reflects a new era of collaboration.</p><p>"I think the agreement has been hugely successful," said Santa Cruz City Manager Richard Wilson. "We've built a foundation for a much better future."</p><p>Wilson, who described town-gown relations during his 30-year tenure with the city as "at best strained, and too often . . . direct conflict," said everything changed when Chancellor Blumenthal came to the table.</p><p>"When George Blumenthal was appointed acting chancellor, he invited me to his office, and we spent all morning talking about the issues," recalled Wilson. "He said he wanted to be able to articulate the city's issues from the city's point of view. He said he wanted to listen and then he would repeat what he'd heard. At one point, he asked me when the last conversation like this had taken place--I said, 'Never.' "</p><p><b>Old grievances resolved</b></p><p>That quest for understanding was shared by then-Mayor Coonerty, who is also widely credited with shepherding the talks that led to last August's breakthrough agreement.</p><p>"It's a model agreement," said Mark Dettle, director of public works for the city. "Both organizations are happy with it. There are financial incentives built into the agreement to encourage the city and the university to work together to mitigate the growth impacts. That's what makes this such a good agreement. We now have a very good structure to work out any problems that come up." </p><p>The agreement was the product of a seven-month-long discussion during which representatives of the city, county, campus, and neighborhood groups agreed to conditions that resolved litigation over UCSC's 2005 Long-Range Development Plan. But to get there, all parties had to resolve old grievances and longstanding differences of opinion.</p><p>"We couldn't even agree on a definition of what constituted a unit of water consumption, or a trip, or a housing unit, because the university has its own set of definitions that don't align with local governments'," recalled Wilson. </p><p>Dettle noted that representatives of the Coalition to Limit University Expansion, a neighborhood group, "added to the dynamics of the discussion and kept the city and university focused on outside interests that are also important to the community."</p><p>Blumenthal and Coonerty "displayed a lot of courage" during mediation talks, said Wilson. "They didn't have to, but they both chose to push forward."</p><p>"Now our vocabulary is the same," he said. "Whatever disagreements we might have, we'll be using the same vocabulary. I think we've fundamentally changed the basic relationship for the better. I'm really excited about it."</p><p>In the 12 months since the agreement was signed, "some great things have happened," said Dettle. "In terms of water conservation, the university has run with the requirements of the agreement and done a great job. It's a clear example of where everyone has benefited from this agreement."</p><p><b>Traffic</b></p><p>On campus, Larry Pageler, director of Transportation and Parking Services, sees positive trends in traffic patterns, as well. The flow of traffic to campus remains at 1997 levels, despite the fact that enrollment has grown by nearly 6,000 students since then. Faculty, staff, and students share a commitment to alternative transit, and the campus offers incentives in the form of subsidized bus passes, carpools and vanpools, and a free bike shuttle. </p><p>"Our population wants to be healthy, they want to ride their bikes, they care about sustainability and climate change," said Pageler. "The fact that we have alternatives gives people options when gas hits $4 a gallon, like it did last fall." </p><p>Indeed, last fall the number of bike trips per day jumped to 1,800, compared to an average of 1,000 per day. "That's a good trend," noted Pageler. "It keeps getting better."</p><p>The campus has made agreed-upon payments of $1.4 million toward the redesign of several intersections that the city has targeted for improvement, and an additional $500,000 toward the repaving of Bay Street. UCSC has also secured a grant to fund the installation next summer of a traffic signal at the campus's west entrance.</p><p>"Even in a period of constrained budgets, both sides are bending over backward to honor their obligations," said John Barnes, director of campus planning. </p><p><b>Housing</b></p><p>On the housing front, UCSC is adding 300 new on-campus beds at Porter College and is working with the city and the Santa Cruz Neighbors group to address complaints from neighbors about rowdy student households in town. </p><p>"Housing is key, because so many other issues flow from it," said Coonerty, noting that if more students live on campus, city streets are less impacted.</p><p>As creative problem solving becomes the norm and memories of discord fade, city and campus staffers talk about a "shift in mindset" and "shared interests."</p><p><b>Economic development</b></p><p>Next on the agenda for the city and UCSC is "meaningful economic development that grows from the university," said Coonerty, a lecturer in the UCSC Legal Studies program. "If we can capture the ideas and companies that spin out from UCSC and keep them in Santa Cruz, that will help us build a more sustainable community." </p><p>To that end, the city and UCSC collaborated on a new Pilot Project on Innovation and Entrepreneurship to incubate business ideas that could become "the next Google," and the campus hosted its first-ever Business Plan Competition with support from the city. "There's a lot more that can be done," added Coonerty. "Keeping new companies here will really benefit the community."</p><p>Reflecting on the shift in town-gown relations that has taken place since the agreement was signed, Virginia Johnson, executive director of Ecology Action in Santa Cruz, said: "Truthfully, the city and university have so much more they agree on than not. The future of both is shared by the other. It's hard to believe it took so long."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c26c68072704601a012ff81c8c2c4"><name>3104</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>xxxxxx</title><summary>xxx</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><description>xxx</description><start-date>1248246000000</start-date><display-name>xxxxxx...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3104</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3104</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338989714</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338989714</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/07/images/tmt.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/07/images/tmt.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tmt.300.jpg</name><file-size>74175</file-size><width>300</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea will foster collaboration, says Michael Bolte.

UCSC is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, which houses the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, the twin 10-meter Keck I and Keck II Telescopes.</p><p>"The TMT will be a great discovery machine," added Bolte, who has been active in the planning and design of the TMT and is on the TMT Board of Directors. "I'm sure we'll find things nobody ever thought existed in the universe."</p><p>With the TMT, astronomers will be able to analyze the light from the first stars born after the Big Bang, directly observe the formation and evolution of galaxies, see planets around nearby stars, and make observations that test fundamental laws of physics. Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy at UCSC, is the TMT project scientist.</p><p>Building the telescope on Mauna Kea--which is home to many of the world's leading observatories and more than a dozen telescopes--will foster scientific collaboration, said Bolte. "Because the TMT partners operate existing observatories at Mauna Kea, it will be possible to integrate our planning much better in terms of scientific programs, the instruments we build, and possibly even sharing key technical staff," he said. </p><p>The TMT is the first of a new generation of giant, ground-based telescopes that will build on the success of the Keck telescopes. The TMT will use new technology to correct for the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere, enabling the TMT to study the universe as clearly as if it were in space. The core technology of the TMT will be a 30-meter primary mirror composed of 492 segments that span 30 meters in total, three times the effective diameter of the current largest telescopes. All of the segments will be under precision computer control so that they work together as a single mirror, giving the TMT nine times the collecting area of today's largest optical telescopes. The telescope is slated to begin operation in 2018.</p><p>The TMT will utilize adaptive optics technology pioneered at UC's Lick Observatory. The UCO Technical Labs at UCSC and UCLA have been selected to build two major instruments for the TMT, according to Bolte. </p><p>"Using adaptive optics, the TMT will produce images much sharper even than have been produced by the Hubble Space Telescope," he said. "It will be a revolutionary tool for looking at the distant universe, when the first stars and galaxies were forming. This will be a huge jump forward."</p><p>After years of consideration, the TMT site-selection committee last year narrowed down their choices to Mauna Kea and Cerro Armazones in Chile. The board of directors of the TMT Observatory Corporation cited Mauna Kea's atmospheric conditions, low average temperatures, very low humidity, as well as opportunities for collaboration, in announcing their decision. The peak of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii, rises 13,803 feet above sea level. </p><p>Before construction can begin, the TMT must complete an environmental impact statement and gain approval for a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) from the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources. </p><p>The TMT is a collaboration of the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy (ACURA), with significant work being done by industry and by university teams studying instrument designs. The project office is in Pasadena, California. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation contributed $50 million to the design development phase of the project and has pledged an additional $200 million toward construction.</p><p></p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Bolte can be reached at bolte@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c2a838072704601a012ffe0a34dc3"><name>3106</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC researchers awarded $2.3M to study vocabulary assessment tool</title><summary>A team of UC researchers creates a new approach to assessing student vocabulary.</summary><author>Tonya Luiz, UC Merced Office of Communications (209) 228-4408</author><keywords>scott, vevea, education, vocabulary, assessment, words, learning, grant, merced, language, comprehension</keywords><description>A team of UC researchers creates a new approach to assessing student vocabulary.</description><start-date>1248246000000</start-date><display-name>UC researchers awarded $2.3M...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3106</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3106</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338990666</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338990666</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/07/images/0907vevearelease.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/07/images/0907vevearelease.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>0907vevearelease.jpg</name><file-size>62154</file-size><width>300</width><height>206</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Susan Flinspach, left, joins Judith Scott and Jack Vevea on a new research project.

They believe they have created a new approach to assessing vocabulary that not only shows how students improve in their understanding of words, but also helps teachers assess the finer points of comprehension.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has awarded $2.3 million to Jack Vevea of UC Merced, and Judith Scott and Susan Flinspach of UC Santa Cruz to develop and examine this new assessment method on a large scale with fourth- and fifth-graders across California.</p><p>The traditional method to judge a child's vocabulary knowledge is to test knowledge of definitions using a small set of words. These words are chosen for their ability to discriminate between students and are not necessarily tied to the content taught in schools. Using this method, the child is either determined to know the word or not based on a single answer to a single question. The new assessment tool is based on words from textbooks and novels that students are likely to encounter. In addition, this tool explores levels of knowledge.</p><p>"A definition provides one bit of information about a word," said Scott, the lead researcher on the project. "Knowing a word also involves knowing other related words, knowing the part of speech, and knowing how it can be used."</p><p>This new tool gives educators a fine-grained understanding of a student's comprehension. Instead of focusing on a single answer to a single question, children will answer a variety of questions about each vocabulary word on the test. Those answers will be scaled to create a score indicating each student's level of comprehension for each word.</p><p>Vevea's role in the project is to handle the statistical aspects of the process of developing and testing the tool. A quantitative psychologist at UC Merced since 2007, Vevea develops methods to analyze what does and doesn't work.</p><p>"This grant gives us the opportunity to develop this new tool, and to assess its effectiveness for a diverse population of children to find out whether it can accurately measure comprehension despite differences in the students' socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds," he said.</p><p>For his part in assessing the tool's effectiveness among the range of student participants, Vevea's share of the grant award will be about $400,000. His portion of the project is important, Scott said, because school districts need to see concrete data that shows how well this tool measures vocabulary comprehension before they can consider switching testing methods.</p><p>"The most important part of this research is the application," she said.

<h3><font color="#285991">2008-09 budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's permanent cut in 2008-09 was $4.5 million. The campus also received a one-time, mid-year cut of $6 million, the majority of which was covered from campus central reserves.</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">2009-10 budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is planning for permanent cuts in 2009-10 of $19.8 million. This includes base budget cuts from the State, as well as mandatory cost increases for employee benefits, utilities, faculty merits, and collective bargaining agreements. The campus must also address one-time cuts totaling $22.1 million during 2009-10.</p>
<h3><font color="#285991">Summary of two-year budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The cumulative impact over two years is that UC Santa Cruz has incurred reduction in the State-funded portion of our budget of 20 percent. The cutback in state funding, combined with the mandatory cost increases expected next year, are of such a magnitude that no area of campus can be spared from permanent budget reductions.</p>

<p>SSC's 2009 summer festival presents two contrasting plays by William Shakespeare amidst the intimate redwoods of the outdoor Sinsheimer-Stanley Glen--the ethereal, magical comedy <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and the edgy political tragedy <em>Julius Caesar</em>.</p>
<p>The indoor Theatre Arts Mainstage will additionally showcase the Bay Area premiere of the exuberant, family-friendly adventure, <em>Shipwrecked! An Entertainment-the Amazing Adventures of Louis De Rougemont (As Told By Himself)</em>, by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Donald Margulies.</p>
<p>All three plays will be performed in repertory through August 30.</p>
<p><em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> director Richard E.T. White's most recent professional Shakespeare production was performed in Japanese; he co-directed <em>As You Like It</em> with his wife for Theatre Company Subaru in Tokyo.</p>
<p>White noted that for <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, SSC audiences can expect an evening of laughter, suspense, playfulness, and abundant music.</p>
<p>"Everything is fresh about this play because it is so well-structured, yet so playful within its formality," said White in a recent interview with UCSC professor emertus Don Rothman. "The presence of magic, which is hugely subjective, allows multiple and wide interpretations.it's a jungle gym of wonders," White added.</p>

<p>Well-known for its direct and powerful language, <em>Julius Caesar</em> is a riveting political drama, set in a time of intense political wrangling. Lines blur between the fight for the public good and the fight for personal interest.</p>
<p>"The parallels between the political dynamics of ancient Rome dramatized in Shakespeare's play and the recent challenges to our society's social and political welfare are stunningly obvious," director John Sipes has noted. "Democracy is always at risk if too much power is consolidated in one man. The Roman senators in <em>Julius Caesar</em> knew that, and in our day, we have learned a similar lesson."</p>
<p>Embracing theatricality in its purest form, <em>Shipwrecked</em> can only be described as a fantastical romp of good old-fashioned storytelling-exciting enough for young people, while offering a searing and poignant tale for adults.</p>
<p>"<em>Shipwrecked!</em> is many things to many people--on the one hand, an epic adventure story in the grand tradition of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and <em>Treasure Island</em>, and on the other hand, a profound examination of our culture's need to believe the unbelievable," said director Eric Ting. "Most audiences will fall in love with the play somewhere between the two," he added.</p>

<p>Using a powerful laser installed at the observatory and a sophisticated reflector placed on the moon, Lick astronomers were able to time the round trip of a beam of light and calculate the distance.</p>
<p>"It was astonishing," recalled Joseph Miller, professor emeritus of astronomy, who was one of a handful of scientists inside the dome of Lick Observatory on July 20, 1969.</p>
<p>The experiment atop Mount Hamilton outside of San Jose was the culmination of many months of preparation that included excavating a major pit under the 120-inch telescope inside the observatory. The team installed two lasers and optical equipment to shoot a beam of light up through the telescope, as well as light-detecting equipment and an advanced timer to record the precise instant when the beam returned to earth.</p>
<p>"At the beginning, we thought it was a bit iffy whether we'd get a return signal," said Miller, describing events on that hot summer day atop Mount Hamilton. "Until we actually got that return signal, we were nervous."</p>
<p>After some trial and error--astronomers joke that locating the moon through a telescope is harder than finding a galaxy five billion light years away, said Miller--the first signals beamed back to earth on August 1, completing the round trip of 245,000 miles in about three seconds. "It was an exciting time," said Miller, who retired in 2005 as director of UCO/Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Miller was busy fielding questions from television and newspaper reporters who'd gathered at the observatory for the historic moon landing. Ironically, he was not allowed to answer the question on every reporter's mind because of national security concerns.</p>
<p>"The Russians knew very accurately the distance between Russian cities and between cities within the United States, but they didn't know the distance between the U.S. and Russia," explained Joe Wampler, professor emeritus of astronomy, who coordinated the experiment for the observatory. "Having an accurate measure of the distance to the moon at a moment in time would've given them that information. I was kind of upset about that, because we went into this as a scientific experiment. We weren't doing it for national security."</p>
<p>In the weeks before the lunar landing, Wampler prepared the telescope to accept the laser beam. On July 20, he calculated the precise position on the moon where the laser would be aimed, based on information from NASA about the location of the astronauts.</p>
<p>Astronomer Lloyd Robinson was particularly anxious in the hours before the lasers were first fired. Described as the genius behind the computer interface with the telescope, Robinson had been hired by the observatory just six weeks before the moon landing. Robinson, a research physicist, teamed up with Wampler on the critical task of developing the electronics and computer software to measure and display the time it took the beam of light to travel to the moon and back.</p>
<p>"NASA wanted to be sure they weren't scooped by the Russians or the French, because the Russians had bigger telescopes, and the French had better lasers," recalled Robinson. "They came to Lick and said, 'Can you help us?' There was considerable monetary support. Anything I asked for, I got. That turned out to be the only time in my career that was the case."</p>
<p>Although Robinson considers the feat a highlight of his career, and his children and grandchildren are familiar with his role in history, his attention that day was focused on the technical details. "You don't think about the significance of what you're doing as much as, 'I want this thing to work,' " said Robinson. "There was barely time to test the stuff."</p>
<p>But the best was yet to come, as the laser continued to fire every few seconds, generating reams of data that created the most detailed picture ever of the moon's path in the night sky. "The one-time measurement was a great technical achievement, but the real scientific payoff came later," said Miller. "We were measuring so accurately that we could see the distance to the moon change within minutes."</p>
<p>Although the Earth and moon orbit around one another, the gravitational effects of the moon on the Earth aren't simple, explained Miller. By following the moon closely, Lick researchers propelled scientific understanding of geologic processes on earth, including continental drift. "At the time, a lot of people still didn't believe in continental drift," noted Wampler.</p>
<p>The experiment contributed a grand new chapter to a story that goes back thousands of years, noted Wampler. "The moon has been used for a very long time in cosmology," he said. "The Greeks in 300 B.C. knew the distance to the moon with about 5 percent accuracy." The moon figured prominently in the development of Isaac Newton's theory of gravity, as well as in Einstein's theories about cosmology.</p>
<p>Other details of July 20, 1969, were more frivolous, including a visit to the observatory by a tarantula. "I remember some graduate students from the East Coast had never seen a tarantula before, and Joe (Wampler) had to shoo it out," recalled Robinson. Miller recalled the landing of a fly on the telescope just as the laser fired. "It was a spectacular explosion," he said. "The fly was vaporized instantly."</p>
<p>After Lick researchers detected the return signal, they moved on to other projects. But NASA continued the work, and the reflector on the moon remains in service today--the only experiment from the Apollo missions that is still active, said Wampler. "Once we proved we could get return signals, then other observatories could take over," he said, adding that today's instruments generate measurements that are accurate to within about a quarter-inch.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the development of new technology and the success of the project helped establish Lick Observatory as a leader in the dawning of a new era of advanced astronomy, said Miller.</p>
<p>"In a sense, we were doing a service to NASA and the country, but the technology Lloyd developed was the stimulus that positioned us to become world leaders in the use of computers and electronics in advanced astronomical research," said Miller. "You could say that was the incredibly powerful fallout of this project."</p>

<p>In 2007, research astronomer Remington Stone wrote a first-person account of the project, which is available <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/news/2009/apollo11.pdf">online in the Lick Observatory news archives</a>, under "Apollo 11 Anniversary."

(Peggy) Delaney has agreed to serve as interim vice chancellor for Planning and Budget, subject to Regental approval for the interim appointment. She succeeds Meredith Michaels, who has been named vice chancellor, Planning and Budget at University of California, Irvine, beginning August 17.</p><p>Professor Delaney brings a vast amount of administrative experience to this vital position, having served as interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor in 2004-2005. Most recently, she was co-vice provost for UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiatives. Earlier, she served as chair of the Ocean Sciences Department and vice chair of the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate.</p><p>Professor Delaney joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1983 and currently is a professor of ocean sciences. She has received several awards for innovation and excellence in teaching, including the Outstanding Educator Award from the Association for Women Geoscientists. She chaired the scientific advisory committee for the $115 million National Science Foundation-funded retrofitting of the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot ocean-going research drilling vessel.</p><p>Professor Delaney earned her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology /Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography. She earned a B.S. (summa cum laude with distinction) in chemistry from Yale University.</p><p>Meredith will serve as UCI's chief financial officer, managing five campus units including Academic Budget, Budget Office, Campus Asset Management, Capital Planning and Institutional Research.</p><p>I want to thank her for her nine years of distinguished service at a critical time in UCSC's history. Meredith joined the campus in 2000, after 14 years at UC Office of the President. She has contributed enormous energy and insight as she oversaw UCSC's financial planning and budgetary operations, facilities planning and capital budgets, and institutional research and analysis. We will miss her spirit, drive, and inestimable skills. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Staff and academic employees</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c3b6a8072704601a012ff15e1b622"><name>3117</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna responds to fiscal crisis facing the university</title><summary>A UCSC alumna responds to an open letter to alumni from three members of the Board of Regents and UC President Mark Yudof asking for help in spreading the word that UC excellence must be preserved and nurtured.</summary><keywords>budget cuts</keywords><description>A UCSC alumna responds to an open letter to alumni from three members of the Board of Regents and UC President Mark Yudof asking for help in spreading the word that UC excellence must be preserved and nurtured.</description><start-date>1248678000000</start-date><display-name>Alumna responds to fiscal...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3117</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3117</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338994970</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338994970</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/07/images/brown_patricia.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/07/images/brown_patricia.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brown_patricia.250.jpg</name><file-size>35059</file-size><width>250</width><height>212</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Patricia Brown (left) and her dorm mate Debbie Hillyard on the bridge at Merrill College in fall 1973</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC alumna Patricia Brown (College Eight '75) sent the following response to a July 9 <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=3079">open letter</a> to alumni and friends from three members of the Board of Regents and UC President Mark Yudof asking for help in spreading the word that UC excellence must be preserved and nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Re: An open letter to UC alumni and friends</p><p>I graduated from College Eight in politics at UCSC in 1975. I took my 13-year-old to UC Merced for the first time to hear Michelle Obama (and [former UC Board of Regents chairman] Mr. Blum). Last Saturday night, I took her to the UCSC campus to show her where I had spent some of my happiest academic pursuits and in hopes that she will be able to go to a UC--UCSC--like her mother. We drove through a nearly deserted campus at twilight when it was the most magical and the deer were grazing. The ghosts of Professors John Schaar and Norman O. Brown were lingering there for me.</p><p>When I told someone that costs in 1975 were about $735 a quarter, I left college without any debt, I had a full California scholarship, and UCSC had no grades, their remark was, "that life is dead." I am scared. Scared that in five years my daughter won't be able to make the grade to get into UCSC because another 25,000 UC slots have been eliminated. Scared that the costs will be prohibitive. This was not my vision when I spoke at my college commencement or went as a senior to Sacramento with Sen. Alan Cranston's son to meet Willie Brown and others to lobby for UC funding in the 1970s.</p><p>I never became rich with my college degree, but I became effective. I clerked for a federal judge, just became president of the local county Women's Democratic Club, have been a Girl Scout leader for seven years, and have practiced family and special education law for 15 years. I raised my daughter to reach for the stars--or, even better, a UC. I still read about three books a week from political history to mysteries to mindless fluff. I still fall in love with Beethoven every time I hear his music because of a class at UCSC called <i>Beethoven's Imagination.</i> I remember the radicals Tim Leary, Angela Davis, and Daniel Ellsberg who spoke at UCSC and wonder how I turned out so whitebread. The UC system is the crown jewel of universities and must be there not just for the Nobel Prize winners, but for kids like my regular, creative 8th-grader who hasn't a clue how her gestalt could possibly change at UCSC. There is more, much more to life than money. Intellectual prowess and curiosity and a mighty damn good education.</p><p>Patricia J.

(Photo by Guy Lasnier)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Campus leaders on Thursday held a forum at the Media Theater for staff members to hear information and ask questions about the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/documents/yudof_furlough_proposal.pdf">furlough/salary reduction plan</a>.</p>
<p>The forum was the first of two town hall-style meetings for campus employees. Another forum for academic personnel will be 2-3:30 p.m. July 31 in the Media Theater.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal began by acknowledging the severity of the state's withdrawal of support for UC.</p>
<p>"Despite our many challenges, we will do everything we can to ensure we do not abandon our fundamental principles as an institution," he said.</p>
<p>Then he outlined the issue: An epic state budget shortfall has prompted deep and painful cuts to the University of California.</p>
<p>UC has responded by increasing student fees, approving the furlough plan for faculty and staff, requiring campuses to make cuts, and refinancing debt.</p>
<p>"With these cuts, UCSC's operating budget will have declined by more than $50 million since last year," Blumenthal said, adding that that works out to more than $3,000 per student.</p>
<p>As a result of the campus cuts, UCSC has had staff layoffs, has not filled vacant faculty positions, and will not be building a planned data center on campus, said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Dave Kliger, offering a few examples of the budget meltdown's repercussions on the campus.</p>

<h4>A few other facts about the furlough/salary reduction plan <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3120">Read more »</a><br/>
<br/>
</h4>
<p>Under the plan, staff pay will be cut on a graduated scale according to salary band, with reductions beginning at 4 percent for those earning $40,000 and under and going up to 10 percent for those earning more than $240,000. In compensation for the pay cuts, staff will receive furlough days in numbers corresponding to their pay cut percentage--for example, a worker making $50,000 will have 16 furlough days, or a pay cut of 6 percent.</p>
<div class="info_box">
<h4>Academic personnel also had a chance to ask questions in a separate forum on the budget and the furlough/pay cut plan <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3132">Read more »</a><br/>
<br/>
</h4>
<p>Furlough day amounts begin at 11 (corresponding to 4 percent) and go up to 26 (corresponding to 10 percent). However, upper management will only be granted 10 furlough days, regardless of the amount of their pay cut.</p>
<p>UCSC officials tried to persuade administrators at the Office of the President that staff paid below a certain amount should not receive any pay cut, said Kliger, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Staff were given time to ask questions regarding the furlough plan (see below).</p>
<p>The forum was informative, said staff member Andy Klein, a sales manager for TAPS.</p>
<p>"I'm not happy about it," he said after the meeting, referring to the furlough plan. "But I am happy to have a job."</p>
<p>The presentation was good, agreed Bruce Horn, a media computing system analyst administrator with the Instructional Technology Group, though he added, "it wasn't what I wanted to hear."</p>
<p>His wife, Robin Horn, is also a UCSC staff member. She works part time in the publications department for UCO Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>"This is tough for families that have both adults working at the University of California," she said.</p>
<p>They haven't yet made plans for how to cope with their reduced income, she said. They were close to buying a house, but now they may not be able to.</p>
<p>Calling the present moment "an extraordinary time," Chancellor Blumenthal acknowledged the impact the state's fiscal crisis is having on UC staff.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult for you and your families. We know that. That's why we appreciate your efforts that much more," Blumenthal said. "Working together, we will get through this."</p>

<p><strong><u>Questions asked by staff members at Thursday's forum on furloughs included:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>How will the plan work for part-time employees?</strong></p>
<p>Part-time employees will be evaluated based on the amount they would make if they were 100 percent time, said Willeen McQuitta, assistant vice chancellor, Staff Human Resources. For example, an employee who works at 60 percent time and makes $60,000 would be evaluated at his or her full-time pay rate of $100,000 and would thus fall into salary band 5, with 21 furlough days, or an 8 percent pay cut. That employee would need to take 60 percent of the 21 days, or 12.6 days.</p>
<p><strong>Can some employees be required to work through their furlough days?</strong></p>
<p>Furlough days are to be treated like vacation days, according to Blumenthal. Once you've worked out which days to take on furlough, you don't have to work those days, he said.</p>
<p><strong>What is the probability the plan will extend for longer than one year?</strong></p>
<p>"I wish I could tell you this is only for one year, but I'm not an optimist when it comes to the state budget," said Blumenthal. However, he added, extending the furlough plan would require consultation with faculty and staff, as well as full Regental approval to be renewed.</p>
<p>Kliger cautioned that the cuts this year to the University of California were somewhat mitigated by federal stimulus funds, and things could get worse if those funds are not received next year.</p>
<p>"We really have to spend this year thinking about how we would deal with a worst-case scenario next year," Kliger said.</p>
<p><strong>My unit will have a combined 1,300 days of staff furlough time. How can we get our work done?</strong></p>
<p>"We can't just say we're going to take the furlough days but just squeeze in all our work," said Kliger. "We have to think about what we can stop doing."</p>
<p>That's going to make things harder for everyone, but "I don't know what the alternative is," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Will there still be layoffs of nonrepresented employees? If so, when will we know?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, according to Kliger.</p>
<p>"The savings will not be enough to avoid further layoffs," he said.</p>
<p>He was not sure when officials would know further details about potential layoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Eventually we're going to recover. Will we simply re-establish funding in exactly the reverse of the way it was cut?</strong></p>
<p>"Absolutely not the reverse," said Kliger. "If you look at long-term funding by the state, it never recovers by the same amount it was cut."</p>
<p>Because of that, "we're going to have to think about the most critical ways to reinvest the funds that come back," he said.</p>
<p><strong>How are faculty participating in the reduction plan? I saw something about them receiving merit increases.</strong></p>
<p>Faculty are participating in the plan, and their percentage reductions are the same, said Kliger. They are getting merit increases, he added.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that there might be some flexibility in furlough days. Has it been decided how people will take furlough days, or is it still up in the air?</strong></p>
<p>"It's half up in the air," said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Campus leadership is trying to decide whether to have a fraction of furlough days be mandatory by imposing a campus closure similar to the one done during the December holiday period.</p>
<p>They must decide on that by September 1, said Kliger. So they will propose some options for staff consideration and feedback.</p>

Typically closed on Mondays, the Seymour Center will throw open its doors for five additional summer days this year. </p><p>"A big chunk of our visitation comes during the summer months, and these extended hours give us a better opportunity to share ocean science and conservation with people," said director Julie Barrett Heffington.</p><p>Overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the Seymour Center is a "living classroom" featuring aquariums, exhibits, touch tanks, blue and gray whale skeletons, full-scale elephant seal models, the Ocean Discovery Shop, and unsurpassed ocean vistas. Aquariums and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research conducted by scientists locally and around the world. Interactive stations provide hands-on learning experiences, and docents lead tours and bring marine science to life. Tours are offered from 1 to 3 p.m. daily (last tour ends at 4 p.m.). </p><p><b>Extended summer hours during August 2009:</b></p><p>Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. </p><p>Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. </p><p><b>Admission:</b></p><p>Adult $6</p><p>Student or Senior (64+) $4</p><p>Child (4-16) $4</p><p><b>Location:</b></p><p>End of Delaware Avenue, Santa Cruz</p><p><b>Information:</b></p><p>(831) 459-3800</p><p><a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">seymourcenter.ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c437f8072704601a012ffdf4fdbb7"><name>3122</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our University -- UC's future</title><start-date>1248850800000</start-date><display-name>Our University -- UC's...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3122</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3122</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338997044</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338997044</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Our University, the Office of the President newsletter for faculty and staff, is available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/ouruniversity/07_09/welcome.html">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/ouruniversity/07_09/welcome.html</a></p><p>Highlights from this issue include:</p><p>-- Responding to budget cuts.

In the State of California, there have been 1985 confirmed and probable cases and nationwide the total confirmed cases are 33,902. </p><p><b>Campus Influenza Update:</b></p><p>There has been a cluster of influenza like illness among teens attending a summer residential camp at UCSC in the past week.  A total of 18 campers residing in Crown College and one staff member have developed influenza like symptoms and several have had tests that confirmed Influenza A as the cause.  The testing does not distinguish between Influenza A (regular flu) and H1N1 influenza but the management and recommendations for both are the same.  All ill campers with influenza like illness have been isolated and their parents notified that their children must return home. None of the campers have been hospitalized. Repeated messages to campers and staff on the importance of hand washing and respiratory hygiene have been issued.</p><p>The Santa Cruz County Health Department has made recommendations to lessen further transmission of this contagious illness.  Anyone with temperature over 100 and symptoms of cough or sore throat is presumed to have an influenza like illness and should consult their health care provider.  It is especially important for persons with asthma, diabetes or other chronic conditions contact their health care provider early on to discuss the risks and benefits of anti-viral treatments.  Patients should not use Emergency Room unless they are severely ill and having breathing difficulty.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Drew Malloy, MD-Medical Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915cad798072704601a012ff3f39ddc9"><name>3189</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus H1N1 Update</title><start-date>1246431600000</start-date><display-name>Campus H1N1 Update...</display-name><path>/2009/07/3189</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/3189</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339024187</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339024187</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>July 1, 2009</p><p>From: Drew Malloy, M.D., UCSC Medical Director</p><p>A 21 year old UCSC student residing off campus was seen and treated at the Student Health Center for the first confirmed case of H1N1 influenza involving a UCSC student. </p><p>The student was seen on 6/17/09 and treated with antiviral medication and the results confirmed by the California state lab on 6/30/09. The student had a complete and uneventful recovery and has returned to his hometown for the summer. </p><p>There have been 3 confirmed and 22 probable cases of H1N1 influenza in Santa Cruz County residents and no hospitalizations or deaths. In the State of California, there have been 1492 confirmed and probable cases and nationwide the total confirmed cases are 27,717. </p><p>We recommend continued awareness of this potentially serious illness and encourage any student with concerns to contact their medical provider. Testing for the H1N1 virus is no longer recommended unless one is ill enough to be hospitalized. The vast majority of healthy adults with the H1N1 influenza virus have an uneventful and complete recovery and do not require medical evaluation, testing or antiviral medication. </p><p>Individuals with underlying health problems and any person with severe symptoms should be evaluated by their medical provider. Students wishing to be seen at the Student Health Center may call 831-459-2500 for a same day appointment Monday through Friday. After hours, you may call the free Nurse Advice line at </p><p>1-800-977-0027.</p><p>After hours, students may seek medical care at one of several off campus urgent care clinics. Here is a <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/forms/student-handbook/HC-816-After-Hours-Care-Info-Sheet-1-09.pdf">link</a> with contact numbers and directions to off campus medical facilities including urgent care centers open in the evening and weekends as well as the Dominican Hospital Emergency Department for severe illness. (The Dominican Hospital Emergency Department is open 24/7 but should be a last resort for those with severe symptoms who cannot safely wait to be seen in the Student Health Center or off campus urgent care clinics.)</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Drew Malloy, M.D., Medical Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a26bdfaa8072704601a012fff91c5a08"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2009/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625232619</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625232619</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26bdfaa8072704601a012fff91c5a08"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2009/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625232619</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625232619</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
