<p>They also learned these facts in answer to their other questions:</p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li>Yes, the campus has a long history of activism.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li>No, there aren't bears in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li>Students like co-ed bathrooms. Really.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"We get all kinds of questions," said Rosa Plaza, who, as director of orientations for campus, hosted six open-house-style events that brought 3,000 proud and anxious parents to campus this summer. Parents had questions about students getting home for weekend visits (<a href="http://zimride.com/home.php?">zimride.com</a> is one way to find carpools), what care packages should include (rolls of quarters for doing laundry), and if there were poisonous snakes (there are rattlesnakes in the county, but there have been no reported sightings on campus).</p>

<p>A khaki-wearing father wondered about earthquakes and fire (an automated system called <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/cruzalert-emergency-notification-system">CruzAlert</a> sends out messages to students' cell phones and computers in case of emergency).</p>

<p>And plenty of moms looked warily at the paths that wound through the wooded campus (a system of "blue light" emergency phones can summon a Community Safety Officer or police officer to escort students to their dorms if they feel unsafe).</p>
<p>Part balm for nervous souls, part information service, part the first step in letting go, the annual freshman orientation drew scores parents such as John Scott of San Diego who couldn't seem to decide what they felt about sending their child off to college.</p>
<p>"I'm elated," said Scott of his daughter Virginia's plans to attend UCSC, "but sometimes I find myself tearing up, too."</p>
<p>Parents lugged tote bags full of information pamphlets, peered into dorm rooms, and wondered aloud whether the hard-earned money they were about to spend for a college education would give their son or daughter the boost they needed in these uncertain times; whether UCSC would be a good fit for them.</p>
<p>"I always take pride in my son. I wish him to be successful," said Mukesh Chauhan of Tracy as he gathered information about student checking accounts at the event's Resource Fair. Sending his son to UCSC in a time of rising fees and a tightening economy had been a big sacrifice. "But it is an investment that will help him in the future," he said.</p>

<p>His tall, dark-haired son, Prajan, who came to UCSC because of its rigorous computer engineering program, said he understood what it took for his parents--an electrical engineer and a Subway store manager--to send him to college.</p>
<p>"I feel the burden of doing well. It's what drives me," he said.</p>
<p>"For me, it's a matter of: Will he survive here?" said Karen Adair of Ukiah of her son, Tyler Soberanis, as she sat on the steps of the College Eight patio. Tyler, she said, is a young man with a rich imagination and a love of math and art. He plans to enter Crown College in the fall.</p>
<p>"I wanted to know if this was a place where he can explore and discover and take off," said the single mother of three boys who is self-employed as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>She looked at the throng of parents and new students around her. "I think this is a good place to let him go."</p>
<p>Elaine O'Reilly of San Diego agreed. She thought her daughter Molly, who plans to study marine sciences, would love the campus. "It's like going to school in a national park," O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>But it was the wooded campus that had made mom Charito Bagnol of Victorville nervous.</p>
<p>"I worried that her classes wouldn't be close to her dorm, and I was kind of scared about all the trees and bushes," she said.</p>
<p>"She's a hard-core worrier," said daughter Camille Marie Bagnol with a grin. In fact, said the incoming biochemistry major, it was the forested environment that drew her here.</p>
<p>"It also offered what I wanted--a smaller community" she said.</p>

<p>Her mom was quick to add that finding out there was a police and fire department on campus helped ease her mind. "I feel relieved," she said.</p>
<p>But two parents didn't need any convincing that UCSC was the right place for their son.</p>
<p>Leonard Raznick and Laura Retzlaff of San Francisco fell in love at Merrill College. They graduated from UCSC in 1984 and 1985, respectively.</p>
<p>"It's so welcoming here, so culturally diverse," said Retzlaff, whose curly brown hair was threaded with grey. "It's a warm, small community where you can find a place to fit in."</p>
<p>They had wandered the campus and sat in on an orientation session in the same Oakes College classroom where Raznick had taken an <em>Introduction to Feminism</em> course from Bettina Aptheker more than two decades before.</p>
<p>"That class was such a transformative experience for me," Raznick said.</p>
<p>Excited that their oldest son, Nathan Retzlaff, had picked their alma mater and "a little jealous" they couldn't come back and take classes themselves, they had one piece of advice for their son.</p>
<p>"Take advantage of the education and social opportunities. Work hard and don't get too caught up in playing around," Reznick said.</p>
<p>Retzlaff put it more succinctly.</p>
<p>"I told him, don't blow it," she said.</p>

<p><strong>What is nature of the coordination of the furlough policy with other campuses?</strong></p>
<p>The Santa Cruz division of the Academic Senate has proposed that the campus receive permission from the Office of the President to take some of the furlough days on days of instruction, said Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"And, of course, that is a hot topic," he said.</p>
<p>For an issue such as days of instruction, a systemwide decision is necessary, said Blumenthal, though individual campuses would need to come up with their own specific plan since their academic schedules vary.</p>
<p>The decision on changing days of instruction lies with Larry Pitts, interim provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, according to Quentin Williams, chair of the Santa Cruz Academic Senate. The Academic Council recommended to Pitts that he should approve requests from campuses for six to 10 furlough days on days of instruction, said Williams.</p>
<p><strong>If next year if the budget situation with the state doesn't improve, we will have to come up with approx $25 million in permanent cuts on this campus in order not to continue with salary cuts for another year. Is that the objective toward which you're planning right now, or are we just hoping the state budget improves?</strong></p>
<p>"That is the number we're planning for," said Dave Kliger, campus provost and executive vice chancellor.</p>
<p>Furloughs on a semi-permanent basis don't "make any sense for the University of California," added Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"And I think it is very likely that private endowments will improve, and that the competitive situation for faculty will change from what it is today. Right now private universities are hurting because their endowments are hurting, public universities are hurting everywhere because all states are hurting--other states may not be quite as dysfunctional as California, but everyone is hurting," Blumenthal said. "I think that's not going to continue. I suspect stock market will recover relatively quickly whenever it does ... I think continuing the furloughs is not a good idea."</p>
<p><strong>Can people who are furloughed be paid during their furlough days with external funds if they are not 100 percent externally funded?</strong></p>
<p>Any employee who's funded 100 percent on external funds, such federal contracts and grants, is excluded from furloughs, said Blumenthal. The difficult situation is where someone partially funded on state funds and partially funded on external funds, he said. The current rule is those people will face 100 percent furlough because of fears that the HR systems on the campuses can't handle the complexity of doing a partial furlough.</p>
<p>"But," said Blumenthal, "we're all being asked to assess by October 15 whether we will be able to handle a more rational approach to divvying up the furloughs by percent--that is, the percent of an individual that's federally funded would not face furloughs or pay cuts and the percent that's state funded would, and whether HR systems would be up to that."</p>
<p>If the campuses find they're able to do this, then on a systemwide basis they would change the rule, probably starting January 1 so that it would be a pro rata amount of pay cut and furlough depending on the percentage of federal vs. state funding.</p>
<p>UCOP's Pitts will make a decision on other questions pertaining to faculty-such as, can faculty who take furlough days consult more than the number of days they're allowed?-in the next couple of weeks, said Kliger.</p>
<p><strong>What are your views on some of the main issues involving the future--the composition of the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/21526">Commission on the Future of UC</a>, the role of the general campuses in the future of the university, privatization.</strong></p>
<p>There has been some controversy about the makeup of the commission, acknowledged Blumenthal, but "I don't think that commission's membership has been finalized," he said. "I suspect there will be some changes based on the feedback they've received."</p>
<p>As for the future, Blumenthal recommended reading the 2006 "<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/ucpb/futures.report0506.pdf">Futures Report</a>," which he said is useful because it sets forth an assessment of the funding structure for the university.</p>
<p>At the funding level, there aren't a whole lot of choices, Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>"There's fees and tuition, there's out-of-state tuition if we arrange to be more accessible to out-of-state students," he said. "Those are certainly options, and those are options by which other universities have gone."</p>
<p>However, what he'd really like to see is for the state to take on the responsibility of funding higher education.</p>
<p>"But on other hand," he acknowledged, "that probably is just not realistic going forward, so we need a backup plan, and that backup plan probably is going to have to involve higher tuition or fees for students, more out-of-state students, and less responsiveness to the needs of state of California."</p>
<p><strong>Some of the areas I've noticed getting cut have to do with services that are really important for supporting students who are first in their families to go to college or from cultural backgrounds that are not represented well in higher education. Can you give us some reassurance that we're looking out for the well being and success of those students?</strong></p>
<p>Over the past two years, Student Affairs has had a $6.2 million cut, said Felicia McGinty, vice chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>
<p>Roughly half of that cut was from housing, and the other half was in student-fee-funded areas.</p>
<p>"We've gone back and tried to backfill some of those areas and to preserve specifically those services that impact the most underrepresented students-first-generation college students, students with disabilities, veteran students--so we've given special care to those populations," McGinty said. "It is increasingly difficult to continue to preserve those because they are part of a division that's being cut, but we have a deep and abiding commitment to those students and we are working with their best interests at heart."</p>

<p><strong>We need to see exactly how things are being affected. You said you were going to protect University Relations and the academic research--that makes faculty a little worried, because University Relations being protected, we don't know what it is they're going to have PR about when the academic programs are being so eroded. So I'd like to have transparency about who is being fired and how things are being affected at the very local level.</strong></p>
<p>The main reason for protecting University Relations is that it includes fundraising, said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"The activities of the research office are there specifically to support the faculty in their efforts to do research," added Kliger. "The functions of University Relations, particularly the Development Office, is to raise money not for themselves but for the faculty and the students and the core mission of the university. These are investments to enhance the core mission."</p>
<p>Also, he said, "I agree with you about transparency at the local level."</p>
<p>He's issued statements nearly every month about the budget process, "but we realize that's not enough," Kliger said.</p>
<p>He plans to put out a weekly message to the campus in the coming year.</p>

Diana Madera, an undergraduate at Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, won a national competition for the award, which was established by Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, to honor his mentor, the late John Bahcall. </p><p>Bahcall, who died in 2005, was an eminent astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where Ramirez-Ruiz did postdoctoral research from 2003 to 2006. Ramirez-Ruiz was the first recipient of the John Bahcall Fellowship, established after Bahcall's death to support outstanding postdoctoral scholars at the institute. During his long and prolific career, Bahcall was known not only for important scientific contributions and influential leadership of the astrophysics community, but also for nurturing the careers of hundreds of promising young scientists. </p><p>"This award is a tribute to John Bahcall's achievements, to his love of science and his colleagues, and to his high standards of excellence in research," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "He and his wife Neta were very kind to me and my family, and what stands out in my personal memories of John are not only his intense love for science but also his generous personal interactions and inspiring physics discussions with me and other scientists."</p><p>Neta Bahcall, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Astrophysics at Princeton University, said that when Ramirez-Ruiz described his idea for the award to her, she thought it was a wonderful idea.</p><p>"It is very fitting to connect it with John's name because he loved to help young scientists in their educations and launch them into outstanding careers in science," she said. "He would be proud to know that young physics students are benefiting from an award in his name."</p><p>The award supports an outstanding undergraduate physics student from Mexico for an eight-week research internship at UC Santa Cruz. Madera has been working with Ramirez-Ruiz and UCSC graduate student Rachel Strickler to study stars that end their lives in spectacular explosions known as type 1a supernovae. The project involves searching archived observations of nearby galaxies where supernovae have occurred to find earlier images of the explosion sites.</p><p>"It is an honor to be the first recipient of the John Bahcall Award, and I cannot express enough how thankful I am for all that my mentors here at Santa Cruz have done to help me realize my full potential," Madera said.</p><p>The Bahcall Award is similar to the Leon Lederman Award, which Ramirez-Ruiz won in 1997 as an undergraduate at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico in Mexico City. The Lederman Award enabled him to study astrophysics at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, after which Bahcall recruited him for a postdoctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study.</p><p>Ramirez-Ruiz is funding the Bahcall Award in part with money from a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2491">Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering</a>, which he won last year. Additional funding was provided by an anonymous donor. Fundacion Hertel, a nonprofit organization for the advancement of physics in Mexico, oversees a national competition leading to the selection of the winners of both the Lederman and Bahcall awards.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c589d8072704601a012ffc8fb5440"><name>3134</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute holds workshops on local electric microgrids</title><summary>Experts discussed the critical issues in using renewable energy sources to generate reliable, stable electric power at the first in a series of BIN-RDI workshops.</summary><keywords>BIN-RDI, Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute, renewable energy</keywords><description>Experts discussed the critical issues in using renewable energy sources to generate reliable, stable electric power at the first in a series of BIN-RDI workshops.</description><start-date>1249542000000</start-date><display-name>Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3134</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3134</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339002451</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339002451</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI) of the University of California, Santa Cruz, held the first of a series of workshops on the future of local electric microgrids on June 5, 2009. A group of invited experts from academia and industry discussed the critical issues in using renewable energy sources to generate reliable, stable electric power.  </p><p>More than 30 participants spent one day of intense interaction at the UCSC Silicon Valley Center in the NASA Ames Research Park at Moffett Field, California. The sessions, which included formal presentations and discussion, addressed many key challenges of renewable energy, including:</p><p>. The inefficient use of existing forms of energy. Legacy modes of inefficiency could persist in processes created to manage newer forms of energy, as evidenced in highly inefficient sleep cycles in today's large computing hubs.  </p><p>. The intermittent nature of renewable energy. Increased storage capacity is needed to cope with the intermittent availability of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and ocean power. Storage problems could be solved through the use of larger versions of the now-successful electric car battery or in batches of these employed for use in a local grid. Other means are under investigation as well.</p><p>. The capacity to achieve nationally sustainable management practices in the business of energy. Trading stored forms of renewable energy will be more complex than in the past. Also, as more people turn to rechargeable means of storing energy, the current economies of scale achieved by electric utilities during downtimes could be threatened. Downtime might become a thing of the past.</p><p>Participants in the workshop came from eight universities, three large Silicon Valley companies, and several Silicon Valley startups. Together they represented a global community of researchers and practioners. Their next steps include drafting a proposal to establish more renewable energy test beds similar to one under development by UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the NASA Ames Research Park; developing more collaboration between institutions; and expanding the expert participant list.

The goal of these initiatives is to foster global collaborative study and research that yields useful alternative energy solutions.</p>
<p>A June 5 workshop addressed the future of local electric microgrids. As local generation and use of power becomes more prevalent, new microgrid distribution infrastructures are emerging that are optimal for local sources of renewable energy. The workshop examined how best to plan for microgrid distribution systems, including but not limited to photovoltaic sources. Participants included researchers from academic, government, nonprofit, and industry organizations in California, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. It was the first in a planned series of <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/microgridworkshop">BIN-RDI workshops</a> on the renewable energy microgrid.</p>
<p>The Photovoltaic Test-bed Facility broke ground in June at the BIN-RDI facilities at NASA Ames Research Center. Phase one involved the installation of a solar panel array and other equipment. Led by Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering at UCSC'S Jack Baskin School of Engineering, the test bed will address knowledge and experience gaps that inhibit the establishment of shared standards for the integration of different renewable energy sources in distributed grids. Wind turbines will be added to the facility in phase two. The project is supported by BIN-RDI and NASA's Aligned Research Program.</p>
<p>Five UCSC engineering students sponsored by BIN-RDI are doing summer research internships with Nobuhiko Kobayashi, associate professor of electrical engineering, who leads the <a href="http://asl.ucsc.edu/affiliates/nectar.php">Nanostructured Energy Conversion Technology and Research</a> (NECTAR) laboratory. NECTAR, an affiliate of the <a href="http://asl.ucsc.edu/">Advanced Studies Laboratories</a> (ASL), conducts fundamental research to develop next-generation energy sources using nanoscale materials and technologies. The student interns are working to create new materials for NECTAR projects.</p>
<p>UCSC faculty affiliated with BIN-RDI are also participating in the Denmark-California Renewable Energy Summer Program, a four-week intensive summer program designed to inspire and prepare students to find sustainable solutions to climate change. The program includes activities at UCSC, UC Davis, UCSC facilities at NASA Ames, and UC Merced. It features a systems approach to understanding energy technologies, project-based learning, and the managerial and entrepreneurial aspects of "green business." This is the second year of the program; the summer 2008 session took place in the Zealand and Lolland regions of Denmark. Kubby and Ali Shakouri, professor of electrical engineering, lead the faculty in this program. Participants include students from UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, UC Merced, Copenhagen University, Aarhus University, and the Technical University of Denmark.</p>
<p>The summer school students work collaboratively in small teams to identify challenges, opportunities, and interdisciplinary solutions among a range of renewable energy technologies. The teams focus on policy and economics as well as technology to develop a thoroughly integrated understanding of the practical challenges facing widespread renewable energy implementation.</p>
<p>"Much of the activity this summer takes place in our BIN-RDI labs located here at the Advanced Studies Laboratories at NASA Ames," said BIN-RDI director Michael Isaacson, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. "We are enjoying a productive summer and look forward to sharing the results of the collaborative work we're doing in renewable energy technologies under the sponsorship of the BIN-RDI."</p>
<p>The program is leveraging its location in Silicon Valley this summer to include workshops on entrepreneurship and site visits to "clean-tech" startups in the Bay Area. In consideration of the leading role played by Silicon Valley companies in clean tech and renewable energy technology investment, students are learning the managerial and entrepreneurial aspects of "green business" and the financial issues behind clean energy development.</p>
<p>The Denmark-California Renewable Energy Program was established in 2008 with the support of Innovation Center Denmark and Baltic Sea Solutions. The program alternates between California and Denmark to give students international experience and is directed by Anders Riel Muller, senior adviser for renewable energy and sustainability at Baltic Sea Solutions. In 2010, the program will be hosted by the Danish universities.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://asl.ucsc.edu/">Advanced Studies Laboratory</a> (ASL) is a partnership between NASA Ames Research Center and UCSC. Supported by a Space Act Agreement between the partners and directed from UCSC's Silicon Valley Center, ASL is making innovation practical by creating a shared research space at NASA Ames operated by UCSC.</p>

For us, it provides funds to equip the soon-to-be-finished Digital Arts Research Center and to construct the Biomedical Sciences Facility. </p><p>Voters authorized state bonds for these capital projects in 2006, however the state's fiscal problems delayed the issuance of bonds. </p><p>While it's great to have secured funding for these important projects, we continue to struggle with the reality of 20 percent less state support for instruction and academic support, imminent pay reductions for most campus employees, and the need to make immensely difficult choices about our future priorities. </p><p>Chancellor Blumenthal and I recently hosted two campus budget forums for administrative and academic personnel. We heard many insightful comments, questions, concerns and suggestions. We knew going into these forums - and acknowledged in our comments - that many questions wouldn't yet have answers. For example, details on how the furlough program will affect some employee groups await decisions by the Office of the President. </p><p>Still, it is important that we hear from you. Your questions and observations are helping us focus on the most critical decisions and choices we all face. The chancellor and I look forward to continuing these conversations in the fall. Complete video and audio from the recent forums are accessible at the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update">budget update page</a>.</p><p>We've made progress on our long-range budget planning process. Three planning retreats in July involving Academic Senate, administrative, and student leaders clarified six core areas requiring study in advance of fall consultations with the Senate.

But a new study published this week in <i>Nature</i> reveals sources of variability in type 1a supernovae that will have to be taken into account if astronomers are to use them for more precise measurements in the future.</p><p>The discovery of dark energy, a mysterious force that is accelerating the expansion of the universe, was based on observations of type 1a supernovae. But in order to probe the nature of dark energy and determine if it is constant or variable over time, scientists will have to measure cosmic distances with much greater precision than they have in the past.</p><p>"As we begin the next generation of cosmology experiments, we will want to use type 1a supernovae as very sensitive measures of distance," said lead author Daniel Kasen, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We know they are not all the same brightness, and we have ways of correcting for that, but we need to know if there are systematic differences that would bias the distance measurements. So this study explored what causes those differences in brightness."</p><p>Kasen and his coauthors--Fritz Röpke of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, and Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz--used supercomputers to run dozens of simulations of type 1a supernovae. The results indicate that much of the diversity observed in these supernovae is due to the chaotic nature of the processes involved and the resulting asymmetry of the explosions. </p><p>For the most part, this variability would not produce systematic errors in measurement studies as long as researchers use large numbers of observations and apply the standard corrections, Kasen said. The study did find a small but potentially worrisome effect that could result from systematic differences in the chemical compositions of stars at different times in the history of the universe. But researchers can use the computer models to further characterize this effect and develop corrections for it. </p><p>"Since we are beginning to understand how type 1a supernovae work from first principles, these models can be used to refine our distance estimates and make measurements of the expansion rate of the universe more precise," Woosley said.</p><p>A type 1a supernova occurs when a white dwarf star acquires additional mass by siphoning matter away from a companion star. When it reaches a critical mass--1.4 times the mass of the Sun, packed into an object the size of the Earth--the heat and pressure in the center of the star spark a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, and the white dwarf explodes. Since the initial conditions are about the same in all cases, these supernovae tend to have the same luminosity, and their "light curves" (how the luminosity changes over time) are predictable. </p><p>Some are intrinsically brighter than others, but these flare and fade more slowly, and this correlation between the brightness and the width of the light curve allows astronomers to apply a correction to standardize their observations. So astronomers can measure the light curve of a type 1a supernova, calculate its intrinsic brightness, and then determine how far away it is, since the apparent brightness diminishes with distance (just as a candle appears dimmer at a distance than it does up close). </p><p>The computer models used to simulate these supernovae in the new study are based on current theoretical understanding of how and where the ignition process begins inside the white dwarf and where it makes the transition from slow-burning combustion to explosive detonation.</p><p>"Since ignition does not occur in the dead center, and since detonation occurs first at some point near the surface of the exploding white dwarf, the resulting explosions are not spherically symmetric," Woosley explained. "This could only be studied properly using multi-dimensional calculations."</p><p>Most previous studies have used one-dimensional models in which the simulated explosion is spherically symmetric. Multi-dimensional simulations require much more computing power, so Kasen's group ran most of their simulations on the powerful Jaguar supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and also used supercomputers at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The results of two-dimensional models are reported in the <i>Nature</i> paper, and three-dimensional studies are currently under way.</p><p>The simulations showed that the asymmetry of the explosions is a key factor determining the brightness of type 1a supernovae. "The reason these supernovae are not all the same brightness is closely tied to this breaking of spherical symmetry," Kasen said. </p><p>The dominant source of variability is the synthesis of new elements during the explosions, which is sensitive to differences in the geometry of the first sparks that ignite a thermonuclear runaway in the simmering core of the white dwarf. Nickel-56 is especially important, because the radioactive decay of this unstable isotope creates the afterglow that astronomers are able to observe for months or even years after the explosion.</p><p>"The decay of nickel-56 is what powers the light curve. The explosion is over in a matter of seconds, so what we see is the result of how the nickel heats the debris and how the debris radiates light," Kasen said.</p><p>Kasen developed the computer code to simulate this radiative transfer process, using output from the simulated explosions to produce visualizations that can be compared directly to astronomical observations of supernovae. </p><p>The good news is that the variability seen in the computer models agrees with observations of type 1a supernovae. "Most importantly, the width and peak luminosity of the light curve are correlated in a way that agrees with what observers have found. So the models are consistent with the observations on which the discovery of dark energy was based," Woosley said. </p><p>Another source of variability is that these asymmetric explosions look different when viewed at different angles. This can account for differences in brightness of as much as 20 percent, Kasen said, but the effect is random and creates scatter in the measurements that can be statistically reduced by observing large numbers of supernovae.</p><p>The potential for systematic bias comes primarily from variation in the initial chemical composition of the white dwarf star. Heavier elements are synthesized during supernova explosions, and debris from those explosions is incorporated into new stars. As a result, stars formed recently are likely to contain more heavy elements (higher "metallicity," in astronomers' terminology) than stars formed in the distant past.</p><p>"That's the kind of thing we expect to evolve over time, so if you look at distant stars corresponding to much earlier times in the history of the universe, they would tend to have lower metallicity," Kasen said. "When we calculated the effect of this in our models, we found that the resulting errors in distance measurements would be on the order of 2 percent or less." </p><p>Further studies using computer simulations will enable researchers to characterize the effects of such variations in more detail and limit their impact on future dark-energy experiments, which might require a level of precision that would make errors of 2 percent unacceptable.</p><p>This study was supported by the Department of Energy's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program. Computer time was provided by NERSC and ORNL through an award from DOE's Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c5f268072704601a012ff11a73e5a"><name>3138</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The 2009 Shakespeare Santa Cruz season received rave reviews in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Jose Mercury News.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</summary><description>The 2009 Shakespeare Santa Cruz season received rave reviews in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Jose Mercury News.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><start-date>1249628400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3138</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3138</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339004149</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339004149</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The 2009 Shakespeare Santa Cruz season received rave reviews in the <em><strong>San Francisco Chronicle, Santa Cruz Sentinel, San Jose Mercury News, Santa Cruz Weekly, Good Times,</strong></em> and <strong>santacruz.com.</strong></p>

That's almost two full working days a month per employee. The net effect of this is less capacity to support one another in our daily work. I hope that we can exercise patience and empathy with one another as we adapt to these resource constraints.</p><p>Tighter budgets and continued reductions in state support also threaten the viability of campus services that are not self-sustaining. For example, Early Education Services (EES), which has offered convenient campus childcare services to campus families, will no longer be available to faculty and staff families effective January 1, 2010. </p><p>This highly valued program, served by dedicated teachers and support personnel, has been operating at a substantial deficit despite being funded in part from student fees. Given the mounting deficit and bleak fiscal picture, our campus no longer is in a position to offer this program in its current scope. A restructured program, serving children of UCSC students, will continue to be available.</p><p>This of course is very distressing to the staff members affected as well as the approximately two-dozen faculty and staff families who have relied on the EES program. Student Affairs staff has already been in touch with affected families, teachers, and staff. Our hope is that by sharing this information now, families will have more time to find alternative arrangements by next January.</p><p>In the last few weeks I've received a number of questions and numerous general comments in response to my budget messages. Where appropriate, I've asked my staff to ensure that you receive a personalized response. I intend to comment in upcoming letters on reader input that would be of general campus interest. I appreciate you taking the time to write, even if simply to share your frustrations. </p><p>Continue checking the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update">budget update page</a> for new information. I look forward to being in touch with you again next Friday.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c67968072704601a012ff0db607d4"><name>3143</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pool renovation going swimmingly</title><summary>The 50-meter pool at the East Field, closed in late April for renovation and repairs, appears to be on track to reopen in mid September. &#13;

While it's difficult to know how many members of the UCSC community may have been affected, Chancellor Blumenthal and Provost Kliger have asked that we offer our support in assisting displaced employees and their families.</p>
<p>Toward that end, managers and supervisors are authorized to approve paid administrative leave for individuals in their areas who were displaced or otherwise personally impacted by the Lockheed Fire per the criteria listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paid administrative leave effective August 13, 2009, through August 20, 2009, will be granted for those employees who were scheduled to work but were unable to because of the severity of the Lockheed Fire.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Paid administrative leave effective August 13, 2009, through August 20, 2009, will be granted for those employees who were scheduled to work but were unable to because they are members of a University-sponsored response team and are sent to assist with relief efforts associated with the Lockheed Fire.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Paid administrative leave effective August 13, 2009, through August 20, 2009, will be granted for those employees who were scheduled to work but were unable to because they are participating in emergency response efforts with agencies that have requested their assistance such as FEMA and the Red Cross.</li>
</ul>

The endowed chair provides $80,000 annually for a five-year term to support Mateas's teaching, research, and public service activities.</p><p>An expert on computational media and computer game design, Mateas wants to radically expand the expressive power of "serious games." The term "serious games" refers to the application of computer game technologies in areas such as education, training, and public policy. Examples include games to train firefighters for emergency rescue situations or to explore the environmental and public policy implications of different carbon offset schemes. </p><p>But Mateas sees even broader potential for games as an expressive medium. He wants to make it easier for people to create computer games involving realistic social interactions between characters, building on his pioneering work as codeveloper of the interactive drama <i>Façade</i>, considered the first of its kind. </p><p>"Michael's proposal to expand the power and reach of serious games is both ambitious and well-focused," said Arthur Ramirez, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "The proposed research will strengthen the intellectual foundation for our computer game design program, one of the campus's fastest growing undergraduate majors."</p><p>According to Mateas, all of the currently available computer games, from SimCity to Guitar Hero, represent only a small fraction of the potential applications for game technologies. He prefers the term "computational media" to refer to the full range of potential technologies and experiences that he and his colleagues in the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UCSC are beginning to explore.</p><p>"We're at a threshold, just beginning to create a medium that in many ways is as broad as writing," Mateas said. "Anything you can imagine conveying in writing or film, you can potentially do in computational media in a way that makes it amenable to a level of exploration and reflection that is not possible in those other media."</p><p>The essence of computer games as a medium is play, he said. The technology presents the player with a series of challenges and opportunities for exploration that allow for a deeply engaged interaction with the underlying computational model or simulation. But today's games only simulate effectively a few types of systems, such as movement, combat, and resource allocation. </p><p>Serious games require playable models of domains such as social interactions or public policy challenges. Mateas is working to create an intelligent authoring tool that will make it easier for people without a high level of technical expertise to create interactive dramas like <i>Façade</i>. </p><p>"I want to enable everyday people to create games about topics that are important to them without having to hire a big team of experts," Mateas said.</p><p>The difficulty and expense of developing a new game from scratch, which typically involves a large interdisciplinary team of game developers, is a major challenge that limits the creation of serious games. Mateas said he often encounters people who have great ideas for games, but they have no idea how much work would be required to create one. At one recent conference, for example, he met an emergency-room nurse who saw how useful a game like <i>Façade</i> could be for training doctors and nurses to deal with stressful situations in an emergency room. </p><p>"I had to say it would take a big team of experts and a couple of years of work to do that," Mateas said. "Nowadays, games are made by brute force--every object, every challenge you face in the game has been manually placed there by a designer, so only people with a lot of resources are able to do it. A tool that would enable the computer to help you generate content could put the expressive power of computational media in the hands of more people."</p><p>In addition to his interest in interactive drama, Mateas is working on the development of emergency response training games. He has done preliminary work on a training game for rescue situations in collapsed buildings, working in collaboration with a team at NASA Ames Research Center that offers one of the few available training classes for this type of rescue operation. Relatively few firefighters are able to take the training class each year, so a computer game would enable them to practice their skills more often. The focus of Mateas's research has been on developing software that will automatically generate new training scenarios.</p><p>"It's an instance of pushing content generation into the machine," he said. "The scenarios have to be close enough to what firefighters would actually face so that they can learn something, but also there have to be many different scenarios so that they can keep learning from playing the game. There's no practical way to do that without automatic generation."</p><p>Mateas said he is particularly excited about using the MacArthur Foundation Chair as a platform for engaging public interest and spreading his ideas about the potential for computational media. </p><p>"What excites me about games is their potential as a new way to communicate and to reflect on the human condition," he said. "Having the MacArthur Chair helps to legitimize this work and sends a clear message of support for the creation of this new discipline of computational media."</p><p>With a growing number of faculty and graduate students conducting research in the area of computational media, UCSC is at the forefront of this new interdisciplinary field. Mateas said this distinguishes UCSC from most other schools that offer degrees in computer game design. </p><p>"There is a growing number of programs in which students learn about how games are made today. At UCSC, students are taught by people who are inventing the future of games and computational media. We present the cutting edge in the classroom," he said.</p><p>The MacArthur Foundation Chair at UCSC is one of seven chairs funded by a UC systemwide endowment from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The UCSC chair will rotate to another campus after the five-year term.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c6d638072704601a012ff4a9492b3"><name>3147</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1685135229917</last-published-on><last-published-by>stephens</last-published-by><title>Fermi results featured on cover of Science</title><summary>UCSC physicists and astronomers are coauthors of three major papers reporting scientific results from Fermi in the August 14 issue of &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><description>UCSC physicists and astronomers are coauthors of three major papers reporting scientific results from Fermi in the August 14 issue of &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;.</description><start-date>1250578800000</start-date><display-name>Fermi results featured on...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3147</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3147</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339007787</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1685134994750</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/08/images/science_covermed.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/08/images/science_covermed.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>science_covermed.jpg</name><file-size>68222</file-size><width>300</width><height>382</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is featured on the cover of the August 14 issue of <i>Science</i>, and UCSC physicists and astronomers are coauthors of three major papers reporting scientific results from Fermi in this issue of the journal. A "Perspectives" <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5942/821">article</a> discusses the flood of new results from the telescope. Some of these findings were published online in <i>Science Express</i> in July (see <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2009/07/3067.html">press release</a><a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=3067"></a>).</p>
<p>A team of UCSC physicists at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) played a leading role in the development of the main instrument on Fermi (see earlier stories about the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2243">launch</a> and <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2386">initial results</a>). Robert Johnson, professor of physics, led the team, which spent nearly 16 years working on the gamma-ray detecting system for Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). Bill Atwood, adjunct professor of physics, came up with the LAT's overall design concept. Over the years, approximately a dozen UCSC undergraduates, six graduate students, and five postdoctoral physicists contributed to this huge undertaking.</p>

The decision followed a tentative ruling in February and preceded the August 11 riot at Chino State Prison, which Haney described as "one of the worst, most overcrowded facilities in the system."</p><p>In the written decision, the judges agreed with Haney that overcrowding could be isolated as the "primary cause of the continuing constitutional violations that plague the California prison system." The judges further embraced his conclusion that "the only remedy for the ongoing Eighth Amendment violations in the delivery of mental health and medical care is a substantial reduction of the CDCR inmate population." </p><p>They endorsed Haney's recommendation that the population be reduced to between 130 percent and 145 percent of design capacity, at a minimum, if "medical and mental health services are ever to attain constitutional compliance." </p><p>The judges also cited Haney's expertise, which includes 35 years of research on the psychological effects of living and working in institutional environments. Haney has "toured, inspected, and analyzed conditions of confinement in prisons in twenty states, three maximum security federal prisons, and prisons in five other countries," they wrote.</p><p>The judges quoted Haney's description of the "reception centers" in the California prison system--like the one at Chino--as "toxic, noxious, [and] psychologically and medically unhealthy" places. </p><p>Haney and other experts testified at the trial that the abysmal state of California prisons, brought about primarily by the unprecedented and unheard of levels of overcrowding from which the entire prison system suffered, was actually "criminogenic"--that is, it tended to increase the propensity of prisoners to commit crimes once released and therefore posed a serious and continuing threat to public safety if not resolved. </p><p>The judges gave state officials two years to address the problems. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c705c8072704601a012ffa2811d9d"><name>3149</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in Sierra magazine's top 10 list of nation's greenest colleges</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has placed seventh in Sierra magazine's third annual "honor roll" of the top 10 greenest colleges in the nation.  </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sierra, Sierra Club, Cool Schools, Aurora Winslade, sustainability, green</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz has placed seventh in Sierra magazine's third annual "honor roll" of the top 10 greenest colleges in the nation.  </description><start-date>1250751600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in Sierra magazine's...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3149</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3149</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339008525</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339008525</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/08/images/sierra.magazine.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/08/images/sierra.magazine.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sierra.magazine.300.jpg</name><file-size>39989</file-size><width>300</width><height>392</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC placed seventh in Sierra magazine's third annual "honor roll" of the top 10 greenest colleges in the nation.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has placed seventh in <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/Sierra/"><em>Sierra</em></a> magazine's third annual "honor roll" of the top 10 greenest colleges in the nation.</p>
<p>See the full report, titled "<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/coolschools">Cool Schools</a>."</p>
<p>"We have a broad range of initiatives that span the different areas for which one can be recognized for sustainability," said Aurora Winslade, UCSC sustainability coordinator, explaining UCSC's ranking in the top 10.</p>
<p>"Our impressive academic programs, our leading efforts in our dining halls, our innovative transportation programs--in just about every aspect in which they evaluate campuses, we're doing something, and in many areas we're leading the way," Winslade said.</p>
<p>That UCSC is a small, relatively young public university, without the large endowments and environmental programs of some of the other campuses on the list, makes the recognition that much more special, said Daniel Press, UCSC Environmental Studies Department chair and chair of the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change.</p>
<p>"So when you try to mobilize a campus like UCSC around these kinds of issues, you're necessarily going to have to depend on more of the human resources and ingenuity, the street-level changes you can make, rather than such things as building a new cogeneration plant like UC San Diego did," Press said. "We're doing this with, really, a scarcity of resources. So to have that recognition, when you don't have the usual assets, I think is even better."</p>
<p>A growing interest in green issues among college students has led two-thirds of university applicants to say that a school's environmental report card would influence whether they'd enroll, according to the magazine.</p>
<p>Just a few of the environmental initiatives that helped UCSC earn its ranking on the honor roll include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The campus has retrofitted virtually all indoor lighting with compact fluorescent devices or energy-efficient T8 fluorescents.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Dining Services employs 56 Energy Star-rated pieces of food service equipment, representing 40 percent of equipment in the department.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>UCSC participates in Hewlett-Packard's cartridge return program. H-P remakes its cartridges using spent cartridges in the material mix.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The campus offers a bike shuttle, carpool and vanpool incentives, and the <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/">Zipcar</a> program, among other transportation demand inducements.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Of the three UCs that made the magazine's honor roll, UCSC ranked highest. UC Berkeley came in at No. 8, while UCLA was slotted at No. 9.</p>
<p>To create the rankings for its "Cool Schools" story, <em>Sierra</em> sent a questionnaire to sustainability experts at hundreds of schools, covering the categories of efficiency, energy, food, academics, purchasing, transportation, waste management, and administration.</p>
<p>Scores were calibrated to create a 100-point rating system. UCSC received a total of 96, scoring highest in transportation and purchasing.</p>
<p><em>Sierra</em> is the official magazine of the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a>, the nation's oldest and largest environmental nonprofit. The publication has a readership of 1.2 million.</p>

<p>UCSC's ranking in the <em>Sierra</em> magazine honor roll received coverage in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> ("<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-green-college26-2009aug26,0,1408537.story">Sierra Club's top 20 eco-friendly colleges include 3 in California</a>") and the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em> ("<a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_13174796">UCSC called one of 'coolest' schools</a>").</p>

</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This summer, renowned conductor Marin Alsop brought orchestral music inspired by the Grateful Dead to the 2009 Cabrillo Music Festival as a tribute to the band's archive being housed at UCSC.</p>
<p>Alsop had heard about the UCSC archive from friends at the Baltimore Symphony, where she is the resident conductor.</p>
<p>She decided to program the fourth live performance of composer Lee Johnson's acclaimed <em>Dead Symphony no. 6</em> as the centerpiece of a concert commemorating the 14th anniversary of the death of Dead icon Jerry Garcia.</p>
<p>Alsop told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that she scheduled the concert in Santa Cruz because "the spirit of the area is in keeping with the band's philosophy, and it is a newly created work in keeping with our commitment to new music."</p>
<p>The <em>LA Times</em> duly noted, "the inclusion of this populist orchestral work on the Cabrillo Festival's otherwise heady roster of compositions is significant."</p>
<p>After the concert, the audience was treated to a Q&amp;A with the composer, along with Dennis McNally, longtime Grateful Dead publicist and biographer, plus David Gans, author and host of the nationally syndicated <em>Grateful Dead Hour</em>.</p>
<p>Johnson then presented his score of the 12-movement <em>Dead Symphony no. 6</em> to UCSC's University Librarian Ginny Steel--to be placed in the Library's <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/speccoll/GD_archive.html">Grateful Dead Archive</a>, which will open to the public in the summer of 2010.</p>

There are a few recurring themes which I thought you might find interesting.</p><p>First, several writers have asked how we will communicate the impacts of the latest budget cuts, especially where services will be most impacted. As the effects of cuts (including reduced staffing levels from furlough days) take hold, we plan to post a list of service level reductions on the campus <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/">budget update page</a>. This will include such things as reduced operating hours for libraries and service offices. It will be updated regularly.</p><p>Second, we have received comments from the campus community on furlough options (91 from non-represented staff and 61 from non-represented academic personnel) that help illuminate general areas of common interest. For example, there was more support from both groups for a lengthened winter campus closure than a several-days long closure between the winter and spring quarters.</p><p>Finally, there is considerable (and understandable!) interest in details on how the UC pay reduction/modified furlough program will be implemented. The Office of the President has asked that each campus submit an implementation plan by September 1. We are still awaiting system-wide guidelines that will inform - and which we need before we can complete - our campus plan. I know the lack of details must be as frustrating to you as it is to me. We will share those details with you as soon as they are available. </p><p>I'll be off campus next week and don't plan to send a weekly letter. However, if conditions change and furlough details do emerge, we will get the information to you.</p><p>On an unrelated yet important topic, I want to commend UCSC firefighters, police personnel, and conference services staff for aiding in efforts to fight the recent Lockheed fire. Seven UCSC fire fighters worked on the fire lines and others continue to assist in mop-up operations. Our campus hosted more than 200 out-of-town firefighters at Crown College earlier this week.  </p><p>UCSC faculty and staff were among those directly impacted by the fire, including a number of evacuees. I'm grateful that there was no loss of life or serious injury, and that property damage appears to have been relatively minor.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c78188072704601a012ff4b913632"><name>3154</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ITS provides information on the HP toner/ink cartridges return program</title><summary>Every time you recycle your HP printer toner/ink cartridge in the HP cardboard recycle box, you are contributing to the "HP PurchasEdge" program that can help the campus save money and get greener.</summary><keywords>HP PurchasEdge, HP printer toner/ink cartridge</keywords><description>Every time you recycle your HP printer toner/ink cartridge in the HP cardboard recycle box, you are contributing to the "HP PurchasEdge" program that can help the campus save money and get greener.</description><start-date>1250838000000</start-date><display-name>ITS provides information on...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3154</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3154</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339010527</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339010527</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Every time you recycle your HP printer toner/ink cartridge in the HP cardboard recycle box, you are contributing to the "HP PurchasEdge" program that can help the campus save money and get greener.</p><p>See the ITS <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/news_and_events/view_news.php?id=486">news article</a> for more information.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c797f8072704601a012fffbcc6a5e"><name>3155</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Ram Akella, professor of technology and information management, was quoted in a &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

<p>As the University pay reduction/furlough program takes effect this fall, most of UCSC's workforce will be unavailable for work an average of 8 percent of the time - almost two full working days a month for each employee. When combined with the significant budget cuts sustained over the past two years, the  campus has much less capacity to support our students, faculty, and staff in their daily work.</p>

<p>In order to help you understand and navigate the impacts of budget cuts, the following information has been compiled.</p>

<br/>

<h3>Budget-related service impacts</h3>
<br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>In order to accommodate budget cuts and furloughs, some offices are beginning to reduce their operating hours and modify their procedures. They are coordinating with offices offering like or related services to minimize disruption to clients.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>It is recommended that before you visit or call an office, check their website for the latest information about how they have adjusted or redesigned their services.  To make it easier to find such announcements, each major service provider has agreed to post such information on their home page and to use the "budget squeeze" graphic (<em>shown above)</em> to call your attention to their link.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The following are examples of the types of service reductions or changes that have been implemented thus far:
<ul>
<li>Greater dependence on automated telephone attendant functions and/or voice mail to handle voice calls.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Greater use of email for submitting questions or service problems; in doing so, include all the relevant information needed to respond satisfactorily to your request.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Some offices have implemented, for example, a "Friday light" schedule where the office may be closed to the public one or two days per month but there are still staff onsite behind the scenes handling workload backlogs.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Even in these trying times where, by necessity, it is not possible to be as responsive as in the past, the goal of each service office is that they will maintain their reputation as a team of responsive, friendly, and client-focused staff.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>The goal of each academic/instructional department-even as the campus is forced to trim classes-is that each undergraduate and graduate student will have access to the service courses they need to fulfill their general education or foundational requirements and/or the courses in their major needed to complete their degree in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

"She is suffocating from gasses caused by our pollution. Ninety percent of her large fish have been wiped out. She's overheating and being brutally exploited. We simply can't live without her."</p><p>"The Society of Fear Pavilion is the perfect place for this wedding," they added. "We are afraid of the total destruction of our beautiful environment. If more people were afraid too, maybe they'd do something about it."</p><p>The wedding in Venice is part five of a seven-year performance art project titled the <a href="http://www.loveartlab.org">Love Art Laboratory</a>, in which the artists exchange vows annually in themed weddings around the world. The project was inspired by artist Linda M. Montano's performance piece, <i>14 Years of Living Art</i>.</p><p>For more information about the Society of Fear Pavilion, go to <a href="http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/bien/venice_biennale/2009/tour/fear_society">Venice Biennale</a>.</p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c846a8072704601a012ffd4b4369a"><name>3162</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founders Day Dinner on October 23 - Save the Date</title><start-date>1251356400000</start-date><display-name>Founders Day Dinner on...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3162</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3162</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339013672</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339013672</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz's third annual Founders Day event, with a theme of  "Fulfilling the Promise," will take place on the evening of Friday, October 23.

These curtailment days were selected after review of input submitted by members of the campus community and just-released UCOP guidelines.</p><p>In previous years, the campus has curtailed services for several days between December 24 and New Year's Day in order to save utility costs.  To minimize the impact of furloughs on campus operations and employee workload and to accrue savings from other sources such as reduced utility costs, campus leadership has approved the following curtailment periods for the 2009-10 academic year:</p><p><b>Winter Curtailment: December 19 - January 3</b></p><p>December 24, 25, 31 and January 1 are paid university holidays</p><p>December 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30 are not paid holidays</p><p><b>Spring Curtailment: March 25 - 28</b></p><p>March 26 is a paid university holiday</p><p>March 25 is not a paid holiday</p><p>During the campus curtailment periods, employees participating in the furlough plan are encouraged to use furlough days but may also use vacation, accrued compensatory time off or leave without pay.  Furlough days may be taken in advance of accrual.</p><p>Employees not included in the plan may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off or leave without pay.  Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation will be allowed to use a specified number of days prior to actual accrual as specified by University personnel policies.</p><p>Employees who would normally be required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use vacation even if the required waiting period has not yet been completed.</p><p>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the curtailment periods should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Curtailment" memo that will be forthcoming.</p><p>Remaining furlough days will need to be scheduled in accordance with each department or unit's operational needs, in the same way that vacation days are determined through discussions with supervisors.  Furlough days must be planned in advance.</p><p>With regard to instruction, UCOP has issued the following statement: "Faculty furlough days will not occur on instructional days (days for which a faculty member is scheduled to give lectures, lead classes or workshops, have scheduled office hours, or have other scheduled face-to-face responsibilities for students)."</p><p>CP/EVC Kliger will continue his messages to the community upon his return next week.  But he asked that this new information about campus curtailment days be shared immediately.</p><p>Please remember to regularly check the campus's Budget Update web site for the latest information:</p><p><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/">http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/</a></p><p>On behalf of CP/EVC Kliger, we thank those of you who provided feedback about the proposed Campus Curtailment/Furlough dates.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Peggy Delaney, Interim Vice Chancellor, Planning and Budget; Tom Vani, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915c89588072704601a012ff650eae0f"><name>3165</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing a Campus Conflict Resolution training series</title><start-date>1251442800000</start-date><display-name>Announcing a Campus Conflict...</display-name><path>/2009/08/3165</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/08/3165</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339014945</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339014945</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beginning September 2009, a new conflict resolution training series will be available to all UCSC staff and academic employees.</p>
