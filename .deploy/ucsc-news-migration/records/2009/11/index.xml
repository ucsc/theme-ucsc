<p>Known as the <a href="http://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genome 10K Project</a>, it involves gathering specimens of thousands of animals from zoos, museums, and university collections throughout the world, and then sequencing the genome of each species to reveal its complete genetic heritage.</p>
<p>Launched in April 2009 at a three-day meeting at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the project now involves more than 68 scientists. Calling themselves the Genome 10K Community of Scientists (G10KCOS), the group outlined its proposal to create a collection of tissue and DNA specimens for the project in a paper to be published online November 5 in the <a href="http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/"><em>Journal of Heredity</em></a>.</p>
<p>The project was conceived by the paper's three lead authors: David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; Stephen J. O'Brien, chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute; and Oliver A. Ryder, director of genetics at the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research and adjunct professor of biology at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>"For the first time, we have a chance to really see evolution in action, caught in the act of changing whole genomes," Haussler said. "This is possible because the technology to sequence DNA is thousands of times more powerful now than it was just a decade ago, and is poised to get even more powerful very soon."</p>
<p>According to O'Brien, the cost of genome sequencing has been dropping steadily over the past decade, making the sequencing of 10,000 genomes a realistic possibility. "The original cost of sequencing the human genome by a major international consortium was over a billion dollars," he said. "With the latest sequencing technology, it now costs $50,000 to $100,000 per genome. The price only needs to drop down another log or so to make the sequencing of 10,000 genomes possible."</p>
<p>Among the authors is pioneering geneticist Sydney Brenner, a Nobel Laureate and senior distinguished fellow at the Salk Institute. "The most challenging intellectual problem in biology for this century will be the reconstruction of our biological past so we can understand how complex organisms such as ourselves evolved," Brenner said. "Genomes contain information from the past--they are molecular fossils--and having sequences from vertebrates will be an essential source of rich information."</p>
<p>At the UCSC meeting, 55 leading scientists representing major zoos, museums, research centers, and universities around the world hashed out the challenging logistics involved in carrying out this ambitious project.</p>
<p>"These are scientists who have devoted their lives to biology, evolution, and the preservation of animals, and now they see an opportunity for deeper study," Haussler said. "We came away from that meeting with a plan for moving forward and an extraordinary online database of samples from more than 16,000 different species of vertebrate animals compiled from more than 50 institutions."</p>
<p>After recruiting a few more key scientists to broaden the depth of the collection, the participants collaborated on the database (available at <a href="http://sampledb.genome10k.org/">sampledb.genome10k.org</a>) and drafted the proposal now published in the Journal of Heredity.</p>

<p>As part of the project, the genomic database will be analyzed to reveal the evolutionary changes it records, and it will be annotated with experimental findings related to specific sites of change. "Analysis of these data will be a far greater challenge than anything yet attempted in comparative genomics," Haussler said.</p>
<p>O'Brien explained that the team hopes this project will integrate genomic inference into nearly every aspect of vertebrate biological enquiry.</p>
<p>"Biological science is about understanding how species work, so having the genomes available for 10,000 species will give us a new sense to understand biology," he said. "The genome is like a sixth sense, adding to what we can see, smell, taste, hear, and feel. If we have this information for species that are not generally studied, it will be a particularly strong arrow in the quiver of students of biology."</p>
<p>The scientists have identified specimens that span a broad range of evolutionary diversity. The species include living mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, many of which are threatened or endangered, as well as some recently extinct species, O'Brien said.</p>
<p>"We are capturing what evolution left us with before the human population started impacting species--a set of genomes inclusive of the biota that a magnificent evolutionary process has produced," he said.</p>
<p>Participants expect the Genome 10K Project to lay a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of recent and rapid adaptive changes within vertebrate species and between closely related species. The results can help conservation efforts by enabling scientists to predict how species will respond to climate change, pollution, emerging diseases, and invasive competitors.</p>
<p>"The risk of extinction is lessened for species for which we have a genome sequence, because it enables studies that can provide important information relevant to conservation," Ryder said.</p>
<p>Genome sequences will be particularly valuable in efforts to assess genetic diversity in endangered populations. "Any tool used so far for evaluating genetic diversity and genetic variation is overshadowed by the resolving power of genomic information," Ryder said.</p>
<p>The consortium agreed to a set of guidelines for sample collection, including the types and volumes of tissues, recommendations for preservation and documentation, and adherence to national and international statutes regulating the collection, use, and transport of biological specimens. Where possible, specimens for each species include both males and females and reflect geographic diversity or diversity within localized populations.</p>
<p>The collection will include more than a thousand frozen samples of fibroblast cells derived from 602 different vertebrate species. These cell samples, maintained by the San Diego Zoo, the National Cancer Institute, and the world's cell repositories, are a valuable resource for genetic studies, according to Ryder.</p>
<p>"When you sequence a whole genome, it may be 3 billion bases, of which only a few percent code for genes. If you want to quickly learn something about the genes, you can sequence the RNA transcripts of the genes. These cells are robust sources of high-quality RNA," Ryder said.</p>
<p>Because the evolution of species living today involved ancient genetic changes still preserved in their DNA, the Genome 10K project can help uncover answers to longstanding questions about the history of evolution. Having full genomes at hand will enable detailed studies of base-by-base evolutionary changes throughout the genome.</p>
<p>"Differences in the DNA that makes up the genomes of the animals we find today hold the key to the great biological events of the past, such as the development of the four-chambered heart and the magnificent architecture of wings, fins and arms, each adapted to its special purpose," Haussler said.</p>
<p>But now the most challenging parts of the project begin, O'Brien said. "The first challenge is to bring this whole promise into reality by actually getting samples, characterizing them, doing quality control on them, and delivering them to sequencing centers that can accomplish the goal," he said. "The second is to very quickly raise the money to pay for sequencing and analysis and annotation of the sequences."</p>

<p>"It's a resource that's just beginning to reveal its potential," said <a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu">Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a> President Frank Perry, in remarks to a crowd of about 50 people at Friday's unveiling.</p>
<p>Speakers at the ceremony included representatives from the offices of Rep. Sam Farr and Assemblyman Bill Monning; County Supervisor Neal Coonerty; Santa Cruz Mayor Cynthia Mathews; alumnus and former Assemblyman John Laird; and Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Congressman Farr entered remarks about the ceremony into the Congressional Record on October 29.</p>
<p>"I want to uphold this historic district as a model of maintaining our state's historical integrity," said Farr in the Congressional Record. "Historical spaces like these are an example of what makes our community a national leader in the preservation of lands which continue to shape our society."</p>
<p>The district, said Blumenthal, "speaks to the important past of the Cowell Ranch and its place in Santa Cruz history."</p>
<p>He noted that the lime workers of the past came to what is now UC Santa Cruz in a quest to find employment and better their lives--as do students in the present day.</p>
<p>"So I think the story continues," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>The speakers then together removed the covering from the bronze plaque mounted on a base of limestone and placed outside the Cook House.</p>
<p>The historic district is an area of about 30 acres around the main entrance of the campus on either side of Coolidge Drive. It includes historic buildings and lime production features and related support facilities that date to the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the nation's official list of significant cultural resources worthy of preservation, in 2007.</p>
<p>The historic district includes the Granary, now a childcare center; the Cook House, now the Admissions office; several barns; the Cooperage, where barrels for lime shipping were made; the ruins of former workers' cabins; the Blacksmith Shop; Cardiff House, now the Women's Center but formerly the residence of lime works owner Henry Cowell; and the lime kilns themselves.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the only institution of higher education in California that has an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, according to Joe Michalak, vice president of the Friends group and former head of Reference Services at UCSC.</p>

"Mr. Ackerknecht's gift, in memory of his late wife Mary, funded the Great Reading Lawn where today students enjoy wireless internet access as they study in the sunshine."</p><p>"The library's state-of-the-art Media Center was made possible by the gift of retired library employee, David Kirk," von Soosten added. "And the much needed and heavily used Library Instruction and Outreach Rooms were supported by alumnus Mike Graydon (Cowell '70) and his wife Sally."  </p><p>The Kresge Foundation grant was designed on a challenge basis to support the McHenry Library Expansion and Renovation capital campaign. It was intended to assist UCSC in raising the balance required to complete its campaign goal and the funding of the project.</p><p>"The Kresge grant really challenged us as a community to join together to support this project and enable the expansion and renovation of UCSC's landmark McHenry Library," noted University Librarian Ginny Steel. </p><p>"It was a wonderful opportunity to help us raise the funds we needed to totally transform McHenry Library and make it a 21st century destination for a new generation of library users," Steel added. "We are thrilled by the success of the campaign." </p><p>The Kresge Foundation is a private organization that supports communities by building the capacity of nonprofit organizations in the fields of health, the environment, arts and culture, education, human services, and community development. Last year, the foundation awarded 442 grants throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, totaling $178 million.</p><p>Construction at McHenry Library is scheduled to be completed by August of 2010. The building will then be furnished and inspected, with a final move-in date set for December of 2010. </p><p>For more information, contact the UCSC Library Development Office at (831) 459-5870.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915dc1fd8072704601a012ffaa2a413d"><name>3345</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lecture series on healthier food systems continues Nov. 17 and Dec. 1</title><summary>A lecture series titled "Speaking of Food: Thoughts on Healthier Food Systems," presented by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and Kresge College, starts November 12. </summary><description>A lecture series titled "Speaking of Food: Thoughts on Healthier Food Systems," presented by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and Kresge College, starts November 12. </description><start-date>1257231600000</start-date><display-name>Lecture series on healthier...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3345</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3345</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339094956</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339094956</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A lecture series titled "Speaking of Food: Thoughts on Healthier Food Systems" kicks off on November 12.

Over the past 2 years, the University Library's budget has been reduced by approximately 17 percent. While the cut in FY 09 impacted library operations and staffing, this year's cut of $1.55 million means the Library's Collection Budget can no longer be exempted. Spending on library resources must be reduced by approximately $780,000 in order to cope with the budget cut, and we must make additional smaller reductions to address an inflation rate of 7 percent for journals and to cover journal price increases.</p>
<p>The Library is utilizing several approaches to manage and balance the collections reductions. These strategies have been shaped by analysis of usage and expenditure patterns for locally purchased and subscribed content and content provided through the California Digital Library (CDL). The FY 10 cut will affect all resource types (databases, journals, books, etc.).</p>
<p>Over the summer, librarian subject specialists began the first phase of work required for these reductions by conducting a comprehensive review of the serials to which we subscribe locally. Data such as overall cost, cost per use (where available), inflation rates, publishing metrics (Impact Factor, Eigen Factor, etc.), subject areas, coverage provided by other journals to which we already subscribe, and UCSC faculty publishing patterns were gathered to help the Library evaluate the resources we acquire and/or license. The first step of this serials review process was to identify a set of titles that might meet the reduced collections budget. This phase of the evaluation process is now complete and a set of journal titles proposed for cancellation has been compiled.</p>
<p>The proposed title cancellation review lists are now available for faculty review until November 30. A special Budget Reduction Process &amp; Journal Cancellation Project web site has been created and contains the title lists, more complete background information, and a FAQ, as well as a link to a comprehensive list of electronic journals licensed by UCSC. Please see <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/collections/budget-reduction-process">http://library.ucsc.edu/collections/budget-reduction-process</a>. Your feedback is important and instructive as we make difficult decisions. Comments describing how loss of a specific resource will impact student and research success at the programmatic level will be most useful.</p>
<p>You can be assured that articles from any canceled journals will be available to you through interlibrary loan, most often delivered directly to your desktop. Fortunately, technologies and extensive collaborative collection building with other UC libraries now provide us excellent options for rapidly delivering information to you when journals are not locally owned.</p>
<p>We appreciate your important input for this endeavor. Please do not hesitate to contact me (<a href="mailto:&quot;vsteel@ucsc.edu&quot;">vsteel@ucsc.edu</a>) or Kerry Scott, Head of the Collection Development Department (<a href="mailto:">scottk@ucsc.edu</a>) or your library subject specialist (<a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/collections/subject-specialists">http://library.ucsc.edu/collections/subject-specialists</a>) with questions and concerns. All of us who work in the library are aware of the serious impacts these cancellations will have on faculty and others in the campus community, and we regret the need to make these reductions. We will continue to do everything we can within the constraints of our budget to provide faculty, students, and staff with the resources and services needed for instruction and research. Thank you for your support.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty</audience><admin>Ginny Steel, University Librarian</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915dcb608072704601a012ffeb6f9b92"><name>3351</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The media feasted on research about the dietary habits of the notorious "man-eating lions of Tsavo," which was led by anthropologist Nate Dominy and graduate student Justin Yeakel.</summary><description>The media feasted on research about the dietary habits of the notorious "man-eating lions of Tsavo," which was led by anthropologist Nate Dominy and graduate student Justin Yeakel.</description><start-date>1257750000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3351</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3351</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339097351</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339097351</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The media feasted on new research about the dietary habits of the notorious "man-eating lions of Tsavo," which was led by anthropologist Nate Dominy and graduate student Justin Yeakel.

<p>A recent study in the Gulf of California, for example, confirmed the validity of a key concept behind marine reserves--the idea that offspring produced in a protected area can replenish the stocks of harvested species outside the reserve.</p>
<p>"It seems really obvious, but it had never been tested," said Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and coauthor of a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004140">paper</a> describing the findings in the journal <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p>
<p>"We created a model to predict the dispersal of larvae outside the reserves, and the results were completely consistent with our predictions," he said.</p>
<p>Raimondi is involved in a collaborative project (called <a href="http://www.pangas.arizona.edu/en/public">PANGAS</a>) in which researchers are working with Mexican fishing communities to study and manage fisheries in the northern Gulf of California. Local fishermen in the area of Puerto Pe&#241;asco set up a network of marine reserves as part of a community-based effort to manage their resources. Ecological and social studies conducted before, during, and after the establishment of those reserves enabled the researchers to track the results.</p>
<p>Raimondi emphasized that resource managers have a wide range of tools at their disposal and must take into account both biological and social factors in choosing the best approach. Many species, such as tuna and squid, move around too much to be protected by setting aside certain areas. For species that tend to stay put, marine protected areas can range from no-take reserves to various levels of limited harvesting, and sometimes involve restrictions on who can harvest fish in an area rather than how much can be taken.</p>
<p>The establishment of marine protected areas along the California coast, as called for in the 1999 Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), has been controversial. A network of protected areas was established on the Central Coast in 2006, and a plan for the North-Central Coast was adopted in August 2009. In Southern California, a task force will soon make recommendations to the state Fish and Game Commission, while on the North Coast the planning process is just getting started.</p>
<p>Raimondi and Mark Carr, also a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, have been actively involved in this initiative. In addition to serving on science advisory teams, they are engaged in an intensive monitoring program to track the effects of the reserves that have already been established.</p>
<p>"We are monitoring those areas at unprecedented levels. It's a comprehensive effort to characterize the populations and the ecosystems so that we can compare the responses to different types of protection," Carr said. "Monitoring studies around the globe systematically show positive responses within protected areas. We want to really identify what aspects of reserve design are important in influencing those benefits."</p>
<p>According to Carr, it will take a few more years of monitoring to see the effects of the Central Coast reserves. In the Channel Islands, however, where reserves were established in 2003 (separately from the MLPA process), surveys have yielded the kinds of results scientists expect to see in protected areas. For example, fish species targeted by fishermen tend to be bigger and more plentiful within the reserves.</p>
<p>This effect is important, because studies have shown that larger, older females are much more important than younger fish in maintaining healthy populations of species such as West Coast rockfish.</p>
<p>"When you have a protected population, you not only get spillover effects when fish swim out of the reserve and get caught, you also have major effects on larval production," Carr said. "The bigger, older fish in the reserve produce a lot of larvae that replenish the fished populations outside."</p>
<p>Carr, who contributed to a <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/channel_islands/fiveyears.asp">report</a> on the first five years of monitoring in the Channel Islands, said that the conclusions are limited by a lack of data collected before the reserves were created. It is possible that some of the observed differences existed before the areas were protected, but such doubts will be erased if current population trends continue, he said.</p>
<p>In Puerto Pe&#241;asco, the shellfish harvested by local fishermen grow and reproduce quickly. As a result, the fishermen saw beneficial effects within a year after they had established a network of reserves. Subsequent events, however, underscored the role of social factors in the success of fishery management efforts. A second <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006253">paper</a>, published in <em>PLoS ONE</em> in July, describes how, after its initial success, the local reserve system collapsed due to poaching by outsiders.</p>
<p>"The whole thing got wiped out due to disruption of the social structure that had supported it," Raimondi said. "Scientifically it was really interesting, but for the people who experienced it on the ground, it was terrible."</p>
<p>Richard Cudney-Bueno, a research associate at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and cofounder of the PANGAS project, is the lead author of both papers. "Here was a group of fishermen that had already seen some declines in the shellfish they harvested. This led to the implementation of community-based efforts to manage their resources, including the establishment of marine reserves," he said. "We found that local control of community resources can work, but there has to be broader government support to back up the local efforts."</p>
<p>A native of Mexico City, Cudney-Bueno has been working with Mexican fishing communities and conducting ecological and social research in the Gulf of California since the mid-1990s. He now has a joint position with UCSC, the University of Arizona, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p>
<p>The first reserve in the Puerto Pe&#241;asco area was established in 2001 around an island. Cudney-Bueno and other researchers, working with a Mexican nonprofit organization (Centro Intercultural de Estudios de Desiertos y Oc&#233;anos), trained the fishermen to monitor shellfish populations in and around the reserve. "The response was really quick, so they could see a classic reserve effect one year later," Cudney-Bueno said. "That led to more areas being closed, and the first paper shows the effects of the network of reserves."</p>
<p>The cooperative was so successful it was recognized by the Mexican government with a Presidential Conservation Award. But word spread quickly along the coast about the thriving shellfish populations in Puerto Pe&#241;asco, and other fishermen from outside the community began to move in and poach from the reserves. After poaching began, the system of cooperation that had established and protected the reserves broke down.</p>
<p>Now, the situation is beginning to improve again, Cudney-Bueno said. The Mexican government has created one of a handful of exclusive fishing zones in the Gulf of California, giving the local cooperative the exclusive legal right to harvest shellfish in the Puerto Pe&#241;asco area.</p>
<p>"They now have a strong management plan with legal rights and government support, so I think they will be able to get back to where they were before the poaching started," Cudney-Bueno said. "I see it as part of the evolution of a management system. Social change takes time, and it really hasn't been that long. A lot is happening now in Mexico and around the world as local people are increasingly asking for control over their resources. Various fishing communities in Mexico, including lobster and abalone fishermen in Baja California, have moved forward with the establishment of their own marine reserves and government-backed forms of territorial-use rights."</p>
<p>The PANGAS project, which brings together experts from UCSC, the University of Arizona, and several collaborating academic institutions and nonprofit organizations in Mexico, is working with other fishing communities in the Gulf of California to develop management plans for the region's marine resources.</p>
<p>"PANGAS is now working with the Mexican government to build management plans for a series of species in the northern Gulf of California," Raimondi said. "It's interesting to compare that with the MLPA process in California. The approaches are very different, and it has to do with differences in government and social structures."</p>
<p>According to Carr, the California MLPA process is now being used as a model in other parts of the world, most notably in the United Kingdom. Additional information about the MLPA process can be found on the California Department of Fish and Game <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/mlpa/">web site</a>.</p>

<p>Transfer Orientation Date:</p>
<p>Friday, July 23</p>
<p>Students and family members understand that Orientation is a time for them to learn about academic and social pathways, including advising, enrollment and campus resources. They also have the opportunity to engage with faculty, staff and current students who can assist them in navigating the university.</p>
<p>Attendance at Summer Orientation has exceeded 87% for the past several years. From the survey results we know that students especially appreciate meeting with department and college advisers, and overall feel better prepared after attending Orientation. Both students and family members enjoy and benefit from the resource fair because it allows them to learn about UC Santa Cruz and our various services and opportunities.</p>
<p>Family members play a vital role in students' successful transition to college life. To fully inform them about UCSC, we offer a Family Orientation Program that runs concurrently with, but separately from, the student program. The Family Orientation session is designed to help family members gain a better understanding of the university, and to develop skills that reinforce a sense of family support for their student's education.</p>

This annual award recognizes faculty excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p><p>"Professor Crews' scholarly achievements have been profound. He is an exceedingly respected scientist who puts his relentless enthusiasm behind every aspect of research and training in which he is involved," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a letter announcing the award.</p><p>"Professor Crews has made seminal contributions in fundamental areas of natural products and has been an excellent teacher and mentor to undergraduate and graduate students, in particular underrepresented students," added Olof Einarsdottir, professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry.</p><p>Crews is renowned for his work on the chemistry of marine natural products and has published over 180 papers in the field. He isolates and characterizes unique chemicals from sponges, algae, and other marine organisms, searching for compounds with potential therapeutic value in treating human diseases. Crews and his collaborators have identified several compounds that show promise for the development of drugs to fight cancer and other diseases. The pharmaceutical company Novartis is currently conducting clinical trials of potential anticancer drugs derived from a group of compounds Crews discovered called psammaplins.</p><p>In addition to his research achievements, Crews has fostered the growth of many young scientists throughout his career. He has mentored more than 60 undergraduate students who have worked in his lab at UCSC, as well as 10 master's students, 28 doctoral students, and 34 postdoctoral associates. A popular teacher, Crews brings "true excitement into the classroom," Einarsdottir said. </p><p>In 1994, with a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Crews founded the ACCESS program to introduce students from underrepresented backgrounds to research opportunities at UCSC. Every year, the program brings students from regional community colleges to UCSC, where they work with faculty mentors to conduct their own research studies in the physical and biological sciences. </p><p>Crews, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1970, has received substantial recognition for his contributions to the field of natural products and to the UCSC campus. His honors include the American Society of Pharmacognosy's 2008 Research Achievement Award and UCSC's 2004 Excellence through Diversity Award. Crews was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915dd7158072704601a012ffca3086b5"><name>3357</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>H1N1 clinics administer 1,800 doses of vaccine to UCSC students</title><start-date>1257490800000</start-date><display-name>H1N1 clinics administer 1,800...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3357</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3357</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339100385</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339100385</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>H1N1 influenza immunization clinics on campus during the past two week administered 1800 doses of vaccine to UCSC students.

Their software could change the way people search the Web for photos and videos, and it may have applications in many other areas as well, such as video surveillance and security systems. </p><p>Peyman Milanfar, a professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, and graduate student Hae Jong Seo were able to overcome a major drawback of existing methods for computer recognition of objects in images--the need for an extensive "training" phase using a large number of examples. With a single photograph or video clip as a template, their software can sift through thousands of images or videos to pull out the ones that look like the template.</p><p>"When you search Google Images, you type in a term and it gives you returns from pages that have that text in them. We want to be able to upload an image and use it as a model for finding similar images," Milanfar said.</p><p>Milanfar and Seo developed an algorithm that enables automated recognition of both objects in images and actions in videos. The software analyzes an image or short movie and characterizes the most important constituents of the object or action represented. It can then search for those constituents in image and video databases. The researchers presented their new methods at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision in September and in a recent paper published by the <i>IEEE Transcripts on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</i>.</p><p>"When it comes to recognizing things in the visual world, humans have some uncanny abilities which, at least until now, well exceed the limits of what could be done by computer," Milanfar said. "In particular, we have the capacity to recognize an object after having seen it only once."</p><p>Existing technology can search for and distinguish individual objects in a database of images only after running through a time-consuming training phase. "If you're looking for images of bicycles, for instance, current algorithms have to be shown pictures of hundreds, if not thousands, of bicycles in order to be able to recognize a bicycle," Milanfar said.</p><p>With his new software, a single photo of a bicycle at night can be used as a template to locate pictures of bicycles in full sunlight, in the foreground or the background. It works under a wide range of image qualities and lighting discrepancies. The template image or the target image can be sharp or out-of-focus, clean or noisy. To Milanfar's software, a bicycle is a bicycle.</p><p>Similarly, a person riding a bicycle is a person riding a bicycle. Video of Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France can be used to find clips of men and women riding along an ordinary street.</p><p>But the potential applications for Milanfar's work go well beyond browsing for cyclists on YouTube. By using videos of aggressive behavior as templates, the technology could help surveillance systems learn to recognize potentially dangerous situations. If a man reached for a weapon on camera and that action matched a template of such behavior, surveillance software could alert a busy security guard.</p><p>A picture is a composite of thousands of pixels. Milanfar's software examines these pixels and their relation to one another. In other words, how similar is a central pixel to adjacent pixels in orientation, coloring, and shading? To find actions within videos, like a man riding a bicycle, Milanfar's software completes the same procedures but incorporates the manner in which those pixel relationships move over time.</p><p>The software analyzes the map of pixel relationships and determines the salient geometric features of the object or action. These components remain perceptually constant within an object regardless of image quality. </p><p>"The geometry of the bicycle is recognizable by the shape of the wheels and the way they are connected to the body, for example," Milanfar said. "We compute features from an image that are very stable. They are there even if we make the object bigger or smaller, change the background, or add noise."</p><p>Search engines can use this algorithm to detect similar patterns of pixel relationships in a whole database of photos. The software calculates the statistical likelihood that a candidate image contains the queried object. If the template is a bicycle, the outcome consists of a series of photographs containing bicycles of all shapes and sizes, ranked in order of similarity.</p><p>"This has been an area of research that has entertained people for many years, but the big successes have been few and far between," Milanfar said. "Our work is showing state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy as good as or better than any algorithm out there."</p><p>Funding for this research was provided in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ddb5c8072704601a012ffbdb47162"><name>3360</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ridesharing opportunity for Thanksgiving </title><start-date>1257836400000</start-date><display-name>Ridesharing opportunity for Thanksgiving...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3360</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3360</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339101479</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339101479</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Heading home for Thanksgiving? Use Zimride to find others going the same way as you are. Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has partnered with Zimride to provide a UCSC-specific rideshare program that makes it easy to share seats in your car or catch a ride with fellow UCSC students.</p><p>Zimride works at the spur-of-the-moment for quick trips to San Jose, San Francisco, and Bay Area cities when you want to get to your special event. It works for sharing a ride to the airport, or for road trips home for the holidays and breaks. You can also use Zimride to find a UCSC student or employee to carpool with on a regular basis.</p><p>It's simple. Have a car? Split the costs and save money by driving other members of the UCSC community. Don't have a car? Find a ride where you need to go. If you are a Zipcar member, you can post your ride and share the costs, too! With Zimride you can also check out the profiles of your classmates before you share the ride.</p><p>Ridesharing reduces campus traffic and parking impacts, and substantially reduces your carbon footprint.

The rankings, compiled at the University of Connecticut, draw on the comprehensive database and are updated every month. </p><p>The only academic departments of economics that ranked higher than UCSC in the rankings are the University of Chicago (first), UC Berkeley (second), Harvard University (fourth), and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (fifth). The International Monetary Fund was ranked third.</p><p>"This ranking reflects the rapid ascendancy of the international finance area, in particular, and the Department of Economics at UCSC, in general," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "We are very proud of the high-quality research and resulting prestige of our international finance faculty."</p><p>Almost 22,000 economists are registered with RePEc, and the ranking is based in part on citations that are compiled automatically from all documents in the RePEc library, noted Carl Walsh, a professor of economics. Four UCSC economists--professors Joshua Aizenman, Yin-Wong Cheung, Michael Dooley, and Michael Hutchison--are listed among the "top 5 percent of economists in international finance," added Walsh.</p><p>The RePEc database contains information on more than 585,000 items; it includes bibliographic citations for 344,000 articles from the leading journals in economics.</p><p>In 2005, UCSC's Economics Department was ranked ninth in the world in the field of international finance in a survey of more than 300 public and private research universities. That ranking was based on the research productivity of faculty as measured by scholarly publications in 63 academic journals from 1993 to 2003. The survey results were published by econphd.net, an online resource for prospective graduate students in economics.</p><p>Faculty research focuses on global economics, and the Santa Cruz Institute for International Economics (SCIIE) sponsors research, conferences, and scholarly exchanges. The campus's doctoral program in international economics awarded its first Ph.D. in 1992.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915de3c28072704601a012ff6fff4946"><name>3364</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>News that the library is officially looking for a professional archivist was the lead story on &lt;b&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/b&gt; with Jon Stewart, and was also covered by the &lt;b&gt;New York Times.&lt;/b&gt;</summary><description>News that the library is officially looking for a professional archivist was the lead story on &lt;b&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/b&gt; with Jon Stewart, and was also covered by the &lt;b&gt;New York Times.&lt;/b&gt;</description><start-date>1258354800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3364</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3364</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339103631</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339103631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>News that the library is officially looking for a professional archivist to manage the Grateful Dead Archive has been receiving considerable national attention: It was the lead story on <strong>The Daily Show</strong> with Jon Stewart, and was also covered by the <strong><em>New York Times,</em> National Public Radio</strong>'s "All Things Considered," <strong><em>San Francisco Chronicle,</em> ABC News, <em>Toronto Star, National Post</em></strong> (Toronto), and <strong>KPIX-TV</strong>.

She is hopeful that the presence of large numbers of young people will impact the outcome of the conference, during which world leaders will negotiate a global climate treaty.</p><p>"The decisions coming out of Copenhagen are going to affect my generation and my children's generation," she said, expressing hope that the presence of young people will help shape a successful outcome. "I hope we can be heard."</p><p>Givens was one of only 27 young people chosen through a nationwide competition to attend the conference as a member of a delegation from <a href="http://sustainus.org/">SustainUS</a>, an organization focused on sustainable development and youth empowerment. The only indigenous member of the team, Givens will attend as part of the communications group. A videographer, she will provide multimedia coverage of youth participation during the negotiations. </p><p>She will also represent the <a href="http://www.ienearth.org/">Indigenous Environmental Network</a> as part of their Native Youth Delegation. Givens, who was born in Guatemala, was adopted at the age of three months and raised in El Cerrito with virtually no awareness of her ethnic background. Of Kachiquel Mayan and Yaqui descent, she embraced her ethnicity and culture at the age of 14. Since then, she has pursued opportunities to learn more about indigenous issues.</p><p>Last spring, she attended the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change in Anchorage, Alaska. "I'm privileged not to be living on the front-line of climate change," she said. "But it was really different to meet my counterparts from Tanzania and Samoa, because they're feeling the effects now. It was a real wake-up call for me."</p><p>During the summer, Givens attended the American Indian Journalism Institute in South Dakota, which she likened to a 10-day "multimedia boot camp." A budding photojournalist and videographer, Givens looks forward to collaborating in Copenhagen with other U.S. and international youth climate activists to engage policymakers at the international level. SustainUS will push for a "bold, binding and just international climate treaty with science-based targets" to slow the pace of climate change. "I will also closely follow and advocate for the rights of indigenous peoples," she said.</p><p>To prepare for Copenhagen, Givens enrolled this fall in Michael Loik's class, "Ecological Forecast for Global Warming." </p><p>"She's been very proactive," said Loik, an associate professor of environmental studies. "She has this gigantic binder of things she's reading to prepare. She's a real go-getter." </p><p>Givens will earn academic credit for participating in the conference by writing a paper and preparing a report, which will likely take the form of a video, said Loik. "She enrolled in my class and sent me e-mail months before to tell me about Copenhagen and ask if she could meet with me," recalled Loik. "She seems really, really self-motivated." </p><p>As a freshman last year, Givens "talked her way in" to upper-division classes, taking courses in American studies about Native American women and cultural representation. This fall she is taking an upper-division politics class in international law.</p><p>"I can see how all this has come at the right time to prepare me for Copenhagen," she said. "So much has conspired to help me for quite a long time now."</p><p>----</p><p>Keep up with Givens in Copenhagen by visiting <a href="http://sustainus.org/">SustainUS.org</a> and <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/">ItsGettingHotInHere.org--Dispatches from the Youth Climate Movement</a>.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915dedbe8072704601a012ff62d35f0a"><name>3368</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Faye Crosby Awarded UC Merced's Spendlove Prize in  Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance</title><summary>Faye J.

Crosby, a social psychologist and expert on affirmative action, is the recipient of this year's Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance. The University of California, Merced, will bestow the prize to Crosby during her public lecture on Nov. 20.</p><p>"Faye Crosby's pioneering work in sex and race discrimination is timeless and remains very socially relevant," said Sherrie Spendlove, founder of the prize. "She is especially deserving of the Spendlove Prize for her part in helping to transform American society so that it is more welcoming of diversity and genuine power sharing.  She has been a vocal advocate for the path to inclusion and power sharing rather than the old, outdated dominance method of leadership."</p><p>A UC Santa Cruz professor since 1997, Crosby investigates the foundation of people's reactions to affirmative action. Her most recent books include Affirmative Action Is Dead: Long Live Affirmative Action and Sex Discrimination in the Workplace.</p><p>Crosby's research has focused on individual attitudes in the context of social change. She discovered the phenomenon known as "the denial of personal disadvantage," which explains how people often see themselves as exempt from the injustices that affect groups with which they identify.</p><p>Crosby has also fulfilled leadership roles in many institutions and is the founder of Nag's Heart, an organization that supports women and men who work for gender equity. She was a professor at Rhode Island College, Smith College, The Kellogg School of Management, and Yale.</p><p>Crosby was nominated for the Spendlove Prize by the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), also known as Division 9 of the American Psychological Association, a nonprofit organization of psychologists and social scientists.</p><p>"It is thrilling to receive an award from one of the UC campuses and especially from UC Merced, the newest campus where the pioneering spirit seems to be married to a dedication to excellence in research," Crosby said. "I have spent my life working for social justice, and I believe that diplomacy and tolerance are essential parts of social justice." </p><p>A Merced native, Spendlove established the award in honor of her parents, Clifford and Alice Spendlove, to recognize individuals who exemplify the delivery of social justice, diplomacy and tolerance in local and global society. </p><p>"Given the closeness of my own family, an award given by a daughter in the name of her beloved parents resonates deeply with me," Crosby said. "By honoring the values of prior generations, we give inspiration to future generations."</p><p>Recipients of the award present a lecture to the campus and local community. Crosby's talk will be held at 5:30 p.m. Nov. 20, in Room 355 of the Kolligian Library.  A question-and-answer session will be included.</p><p>Her lecture will center on the theme of connection.  </p><p>"Whenever we mistakenly imagine that we are acting alone, we are open to negative feelings and can become paralyzed in our actions," Crosby said. "In all worthy actions, there are structures and supports both seen and unseen. Recognition of the inter-connections of events and of people liberates the spirit and allows us to build a better future."</p><p>The Spendlove Prize selection committee is chaired by the dean of the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts and is made up of a representative from the Spendlove family or designee; an undergraduate student; a graduate student; a faculty member; and representatives from the UC Merced community. </p><p>"Faye is a role model and inspiration for students, faculty and the larger community," said Hans Björnsson, UC Merced's interim dean of the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts. "As this year's Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance recipient, we are honoring her scholarship and her activism."</p><p>The first award, given at campus opening in 2005, went to Dr. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Merced native who is now a law professor and the founding executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard University. In 2007, the prize was awarded to John Y. Tateishi, an activist for civil rights who led the successful redress campaign for Japanese-Americans in the aftermath of their WWII internment. Childhelp founders Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson received the prize in 2008 for their lifelong commitment to helping children in need. O'Meara and Fedderson have devoted 50 years of their lives to the prevention and treatment of child abuse in the U.S. and globally.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915def5e8072704601a012fff8dd5f0a"><name>3369</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Faye Crosby awarded UC Merced's Spendlove Prize in  Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance</title><summary>Faye J.

O'Meara and Fedderson have devoted 50 years of their lives to the prevention and treatment of child abuse in the U.S. and globally.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915df0ef8072704601a012ffd027971b"><name>3370</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC applauded by state task force for commitment to employee wellness </title><summary>UCSC's worksite wellness program recently received a California Fit Business Award for promoting employee health and a healthier workplace. </summary><author>Public Information Office (831-459-2495)</author><keywords>California Fit Business Award, California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness</keywords><description>UCSC's worksite wellness program recently received a California Fit Business Award for promoting employee health and a healthier workplace. </description><start-date>1258095600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC applauded by state...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3370</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3370</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339106978</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339106978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/11/images/ca.fit.business.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/11/images/ca.fit.business.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ca.fit.business.300.jpg</name><file-size>18362</file-size><width>300</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Senator Alex Padilla with Danielle Lewis, Lizzie Yasser, and Ryan Andrews during the California Fit Business Awards ceremony. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC's <a href="http://wellness.ucsc.edu">worksite wellness program</a> recently received a 2009 California Fit Business Award, given by the <a href="http://www.wellnesstaskforce.org/">California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness</a> for promoting employee health and a healthier workplace.</p>
<p>UCSC received a silver-level award for programs and services in four key areas: eating better, moving more, promoting healthy lifestyles, and creating a healthy culture.</p>
<p>Recognizing the value of a fit and healthy workplace to organizations and workers alike, the California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness honored 71 employers. Each award winner received a trophy and certificate of recognition from State Senator Alex Padilla during a ceremony in Sacramento on November 5. Accepting the award on behalf of UCSC were Ryan Andrews, executive director of OPERS; Danielle Lewis, Wellness Center director; and Lizzie Yasser, employee wellness coordinator.</p>
<p>UCSC's employee wellness program began in February 2008 and is funded by the UCOP initiative <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/riskmgt/bsas/bsas_op/">Be Smart About Safety</a>. By emphasizing "wellness anywhere," the employee wellness program provides enjoyable opportunities for faculty and staff to practice healthy behaviors and adopt healthy lifelong practices, allowing them to reap the benefits both at work and at home.</p>
<p>For example, the "Slugs on a Stroll" One Million Steps Challenge, a walking program held over the summer, invited participants to accumulate and track one million steps over the course of four months. Each participant received a free pedometer and bi-monthly emails containing walking tips and encouragement. For every 250,000 steps walked, each "strolling slug" could pick up one of the incentive prizes, which included UCSC Wellness socks, hats, and stainless steel water bottles.</p>
<p>Although the challenge wrapped up in September, employees still can request a pedometer by contacting <a href="http://wellness.ucsc.edu/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=2%3Alizzie-yasser&amp;catid=3%3Astaff&amp;Itemid=3">Lizzie Yasser</a>. Since May, more than 750 staff, faculty, and retirees have joined the Slugs on a Stroll walking club.</p>
<p>During the course of the challenge, the UCSC community tracked more than 215 million steps, equivalent to 107,000 miles, or four times around the world.</p>
<p>The California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness was launched by the state Legislature in 2002 to address the critical issues related to physical fitness and nutritional health in California's schools and workplaces. The Fit Business Awards are a coordinated effort between the California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness and the California Department of Health Services. The annual awards program was first launched in 2003, seeking to recognize private, public, and nonprofit business models across California that promote a healthier workplace.</p>

<p>UA-SV, established by the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Foothill-De Anza Community College District (FHDACCD) to further their educational, scientific, and public purposes in Silicon Valley, signed a 95-year ground lease for the NRP university development area with NASA Ames Research Center in December, 2008. The goal of this public-private partnership, which was announced on March 13, 2009, is to create an integrated educational and research community featuring classrooms and laboratories, sustainable housing, and room for entrepreneurial partnerships.</p>
<p>The new community will be comprised of approximately 3 million square feet of residential and non-residential development. It will, in conjunction with adjacent NASA research facilities, serve as a test-bed for advances in green technologies and provide an environment that nurtures innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainability.</p>
<p>UA-SV is very pleased with the selection of TMG Partners and the Related Companies, two highly successful companies with particular expertise in mixed-use development, as partners in this exciting new development. TMG/Related and UA-SV will enter into an exclusive negotiating agreement that specifies the business terms of their relationship through pre-development activities, which include master planning and completing site entitlements in conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, chair of the UA-SV board, said the board "is enthusiastic about working with TMG/Related as we bring this exciting, green project to fruition. They bring outstanding credentials, expertise, and financial strength with a commitment to the future vitality of this region. I am confident TMG/Related will position this project to meet the educational and research needs we value so highly."</p>
<p>NASA Ames Center Director S. Pete Worden said: "The University Associates-Silicon Valley selection of TMG/Related is a critical step in advancing our partnership to develop part of the NASA Research Park with a consortium of universities led by UCSC. The UA-SV development will assist NASA with R&amp;D and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and help us bring forth new ideas in both education and technology to address the great challenges facing our nation."</p>
<p>Mike Brandy, interim Chancellor of Foothill-De Anza Community College District, stated: "We are excited to see this development move forward with the selection of TMG/Related. The new community being planned at NASA Research Park promises to build on Silicon Valley's reputation as a leader in creative thinking and environmental stewardship. It will advance and augment the most critical element of the Valley's success--the investment in education."</p>
<p>William Berry, president and CEO of UA-SV, stated: "The selection of TMG/Related, two highly regarded, well-established development companies, demonstrates the considerable attractiveness of this project, even in a tough economy. We are looking forward to working with TMG/Related to fulfill the vision of this development as a highly innovative regional education and resource center."</p>
<p>On receiving the news of the selection of TMG, Michael Covarrubias, chairman and CEO of TMG, said: "TMG and Related are honored to have been selected to partner with UA-SV on this development. The opportunity to lead the master development of this three-million-square-foot, mixed-use campus on behalf of NASA Ames and University Associates-Silicon Valley is extraordinary. A new community integrating the commercial, science and residential components with technology companies of Silicon Valley can be found nowhere else."</p>
<p>"The master plan to add a residential and retail community to this consortium presents the opportunity to create a true community, not just a series of buildings," added William Witte, president of the Related Companies California. "This has the potential to become a model for sustainable development."</p>

This year the campus will be closed from Saturday, December 19, 2009 through Friday, January 1, 2010, re-opening on Monday, January 4, 2010. The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p><p>During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.</p><p>If you are required to work all or part of this closure, you must receive approval from your unit head and Principal Officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their Principal Officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:pahelm@ucsc.edu">pahelm@ucsc.edu</a>, by campus mail to Melody Pahel, Physical Plant at Barn G, or by fax (9-5121,) no later than Friday, December 11, 2009, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate SHR Partner for time and payroll accounting purposes. Faculty are urged to announce the closure broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closures.</p><p>If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on campus closure exceptions, please contact Melody Pahel at 9-5561.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Jim Dunne, Interim Director - Physical Plant </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915df7738072704601a012fffda4c1c6"><name>3374</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Post Employment Benefits Task Force Fact-finding Meeting</title><start-date>1257231600000</start-date><display-name>UC Post Employment Benefits...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3374</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3374</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339108669</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339108669</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On November 3, 2009, members of the UC Post-Employment Benefits Task Force held a fact-finding meeting at the Stevenson Event Center.

Calling themselves the Genome 10K Community of Scientists, the group outlined its proposal to create a collection of tissue and DNA specimens for the project in a <a href="http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/esp086">paper</a> published online November 5 in the <i>Journal of Heredity</i>. </p><p>The project was conceived by the paper's three lead authors: David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; Stephen J. O'Brien, chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute; and Oliver A. Ryder, director of genetics at the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research and adjunct professor of biology at UC San Diego. </p><p>"For the first time, we have a chance to really see evolution in action, caught in the act of changing whole genomes," Haussler said. "This is possible because the technology to sequence DNA is thousands of times more powerful now than it was just a decade ago, and is poised to get even more powerful very soon."</p><p>Among the authors is pioneering geneticist Sydney Brenner, a Nobel Laureate and senior distinguished fellow at the Salk Institute. "The most challenging intellectual problem in biology for this century will be the reconstruction of our biological past so we can understand how complex organisms such as ourselves evolved," Brenner said. "Genomes contain information from the past--they are molecular fossils--and having sequences from vertebrates will be an essential source of rich information."</p><p>At the UCSC meeting, 55 leading scientists representing major zoos, museums, research centers, and universities around the world hashed out the challenging logistics involved in carrying out this ambitious project. Participants included UCSC biologists Giacomo Bernardi, James Estes, Barry Sinervo, and Terrie Williams.</p><p>The scientists have identified specimens that span a broad range of evolutionary diversity. The species include living mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, many of which are threatened or endangered, as well as some recently extinct species, O'Brien said. </p><p>"We are capturing what evolution left us with before the human population started impacting species--a set of genomes inclusive of the biota that a magnificent evolutionary process has produced," he said.</p><p>According to Ryder, genome sequences will be particularly valuable in efforts to assess genetic diversity in endangered populations. "Any tool used so far for evaluating genetic diversity and genetic variation is overshadowed by the resolving power of genomic information," he said.</p><p>The collection will include more than a thousand frozen samples of fibroblast cells derived from 602 different vertebrate species. These cell samples, maintained by the San Diego Zoo, the National Cancer Institute, and the world's cell repositories, are a valuable resource for genetic studies, Ryder said.</p><p>Because the evolution of species living today involved ancient genetic changes still preserved in their DNA, the Genome 10K project can help uncover answers to longstanding questions about the history of evolution. Having full genomes at hand will enable detailed studies of evolutionary changes throughout the genome. </p><p>"Differences in the DNA that makes up the genomes of the animals we find today hold the key to the great biological events of the past, such as the development of the four-chambered heart and the magnificent architecture of wings, fins, and arms, each adapted to its special purpose," Haussler said.</p><p>But now the most challenging parts of the project begin, O'Brien said. "The first challenge is to bring this whole promise into reality by actually getting samples, characterizing them, doing quality control on them, and delivering them to sequencing centers that can accomplish the goal," he said. "The second is to very quickly raise the money to pay for sequencing and analysis and annotation of the sequences."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915dfbc48072704601a012ffc00770ee"><name>3376</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff, faculty budget forums offer chance to ask questions</title><summary>Campus officials gave a presentation and answered questions last week at two town hall forums on the budget, one for staff and one for academic employees. </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>budget</keywords><description>Campus officials gave a presentation and answered questions last week at two town hall forums on the budget, one for staff and one for academic employees. </description><start-date>1258441200000</start-date><display-name>Staff, faculty budget forums...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3376</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3376</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339109772</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339109772</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/11/images/budget.forum.09.10.11.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/11/images/budget.forum.09.10.11.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>budget.forum.09.10.11.300.jpg</name><file-size>14860</file-size><width>300</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor Blumenthal, CP/EVC Kliger, and interim VC for Planning and Budget Margaret Delaney at the staff budget forum. (Photo by Guy Lasnier)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Campus officials gave a presentation and answered questions last week at two town hall forums on the budget, one for staff and one for academic employees.</p>
<p>At the forums, Chancellor George Blumenthal, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, and interim Vice Chancellor for Planning and Budget Margaret Delaney provided the latest updates on efforts to implement changes stemming from budget cuts. Academic Senate Chair Lori Kletzer also helped moderate the forum for academic employees.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal reviewed the reductions UC has taken because of the shortfall in the state budget. In the 2008-09 and the 2009-10 academic years, UC has had to adjust to a nearly $1 billion funding decrease compared with its 2007-08 base, he said.</p>
<p>In response to systemwide reductions of this scale, UC has to date:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased student fees and is considering addition increases at its mid-November meeting;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Implemented a systemwide salary-reduction and furlough program;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Pursued other one-time actions, such as debt refinancing.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Reduced funding to campuses.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>As its share of systemwide reductions, UC Santa Cruz has sustained more than $50 million in cuts, said Kliger-of which about half, $24.2 million, were on-going reductions that have led to cuts to campus programs.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the state's fiscal condition continues to deteriorate," Blumenthal said. "Revenues for the first quarter-July through September-are down by over $1 billion, and the state still needs to address an on-going structural deficit of $7 billion to $8 billion."</p>
<p>This week, the Regents will adopt a 2010-11 budget proposal for UC that will request state resources based upon the university's true need-including restoration of a portion of the funds cut from UC's budget over the past two years, said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, given the current fiscal environment, it is unlikely that the state will fund that budget request," he said.</p>

<p>To continue making progress in the difficult budget environment, the campus has initiated six budget work groups that are "thinking about and recommending ways to adjust the way we do business," said Kliger. And, he said, the administration is committed to working closely with the Senate leadership.</p>
<p>UCSC will be smaller and have fewer programs and initiatives, he said, but it will continue to move forward by with actions such as continuing to hire faculty and build disciplines to address the state's and the world's most critical issues.</p>
<p>Many questions were asked at the two forums. They included:</p>
<p><strong>For fiscal year 2008-09, it was my understanding that permanent budget cuts were to be covered by student fees increases and staff furloughs, but that this only achieved half the required budget cuts. How are the other half of the budget cuts to be achieved? Should divisions expect further cuts to close the gap?</strong></p>
<p>"We don't anticipate any more cuts this year. But frankly we do expect more cuts in the 2011 year," Kliger said. "We really don't know yet the magnitude of those cuts. We probably won't know until governor puts out his budget in January."</p>
<p><strong>What's the dollar amount of cuts for UCSC, and what's the plan for choosing which programs get cut?</strong></p>
<p>"The cuts so far are about $28 million in one-time cuts and a little over $24 million in permanent cuts," Kliger said. "We went through an extensive period over the last two years to figure out how each of the units on campus might take cuts, look at the impacts of assigning cuts to each unit, and try to figure out how to assign cuts to do the least damage to the campus."</p>
<p>Those they're not sure what the cuts will be for next year, "we're working on a process this year to try to understand how the impacts could be taken from all of the different units, we're working with the Academic Senate to pose specific questions to every principal officer about how might take cuts and what damage those cuts might do. We will then be working with a small budget advisory group that will be working with the Academic Senate, with staff, with students that will discuss possible ways to take the cuts during the year.</p>
<p>"All of this is sort of guesswork right now because we don't know how big the cuts are going to be," Kliger continued. "So we're planning for the worst and hoping for the best and trying to create contingency plans for how we would take different levels of cuts."</p>
<p><strong>I've read that the state is looking at another $7 billion shortfall for the next budget cycle. What sort of planning is under way to address further budget cuts the state may levy against UC?</strong></p>
<p>"The question is right," said Blumenthal. "The state is looking at a structural deficit of $7-$8 billion."</p>
<p>The campus is anticipating possible additional budget cuts for the 2010-11 year, he said.</p>
<p>"We don't know what the answer is going to be until the Legislature acts, but the first indication of what the state is going to do is what we see in the governor's budget in January," said Blumenthal.</p>
<p><strong>We're putting up a huge biomed building, but we're not going to have money to staff it or pay the bills. I don't get it.</strong></p>
<p>"We've heard before that we should stop building buildings so we don't have to lay off so many people," said Kliger. "But there are ongoing funds and one-time funds. Once you spend your one-time funds, they're gone, so you can't very well hire people with one-time funds unless you intend to only keep them on the payroll for one year. When we build buildings, we build them based on one-time funds . those monies can only be used to build those buildings, they can't be used for other purposes."</p>
<p><strong>Is there an endorsed practice to not lay off an employee right before he or she would be eligible for retirement benefits? Example: it seems both unfair and unkind to lay off an employee for example at nine and a half years if they're trying to reach a goal of at least 10 years to receive certain benefits such as health care.</strong></p>
<p>"If you're talking about nonrepresented employees, the order of layoff and reduction in time is affected by the classification and the layoff unit involved according to seniority," Kliger said. "For represented employees, the selection and order of layoff is determined by the contract provisions for that particular union. So there are standard rules we have to follow on all these layoffs."</p>
<p>"There is no desire on anyone's part to lay off employees at nine and a half years so that they can't vest," Blumenthal added. "But similarly, since we have all the rules that Dave just mentioned, we can't provide particular protection for individual employees either, because we have to abide by the rules."</p>
<p><strong>Individual budget-cutting actions can have unintended consequences. Let's say the Math Department was going to cut something that would have ramifications on diversity or on other departments. Is there someone looking at individual decisions and looking at how they might impact the campus as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>Kliger said last year's process "didn't work as well as it might have, in part because we didn't know the right questions to ask at the beginning of the year." This year, he committed to working with the Senate's Committee on Planning and Budget earlier, to ensure that principal officers are asked the "right questions" in order to assess the potential impact of divisional cuts.</p>
<p>"What happens when Math 2 gets cut is not a question our budget process naturally asks," added Kletzer. "We absolutely would benefit from a budget-cutting process that valued cross-divisional talk. With less state support, we have to make some very strategic decisions...one principle might be that we will do things strategically, not proportionately."</p>

The UCSC Academic Senate and Staff Advisory Board invite you to join us again this year in donating cash and non-perishable food to the Second Harvest Food Bank during the annual holiday food drive to help provide 2 million pounds of food to families who need it.</p><p>Last year, UCSC staff, faculty and students provided over 63,000 pounds of food and cash equivalent, exceeding the campus goal by 100%. Since this year's need is estimated to be 20 to 30% greater than last year, we hope you can support this critical effort. A donation envelope will arrive in your campus mailbox within the next couple of days to collect cash donations, which should be made in the form of check made payable to the Second Harvest Food Bank. Place your envelope in campus mail (red collection bag) and return any unused envelopes so they may be used again next year.</p><p>If you choose to donate food items, please use your own collection bag. Food items in particular demand include: canned meat, canned fish, canned fruits and vegetables, peanut butter, beans, pasta, rice, cereal and fruit juice. Food donations may be made by placing foods in the collection barrels located throughout the campus or may be brought to the base on campus on Friday, December 4th. Campus Mail Services trucks will be on hand to collect food and cash donations, which will be delivered to the Second Harvest Food Bank location in south Santa Cruz County at the end of the day. If requested, Campus Mail Services will pick up additional food donations during their regular mail pick up and delivery schedule. Collection bags may be requested by calling Mail Services at 9-4852.</p><p>All food donations are helpful, but the Second Harvest Food Bank can stretch cash donations even further. For every dollar donated, $9 worth of food is made available to families in need. And UC Santa Cruz is credited 3 lbs. worth of food for every dollar donated, bringing us closer to our goal of 30,000 lbs. for this year's drive.</p><p>The Second Harvest Food Bank is a non-profit organization providing food and basic necessities to our neighbors, 48% of whom are children. Visit <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org">http://www.thefoodbank.org</a> to learn how your contributions make a difference in our community.

<p>"Meals are a really important part of building a community," said undergraduate Sean Dugan, garden coordinator for the <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/village/pica.html">Program in Community and Agroecology</a> (PICA). "The cooks introduce the food and talk about where it came from, what went into it, and then everyone applauds."</p>
<p>Based in the Lower Quarry, PICA (pronounced PEEK-uh) brings together students from diverse disciplines who share a desire to live and learn together in a small community focused on living sustainably. The brainchild of environmental studies professor Steve Gliessman, PICA began in 2002 with nine students.</p>
<p>"This is all an experiment in building a community based around food--growing, harvesting, and eating it," said Gliessman, holder of the Ruth and Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology and an advocate of small communities-within-the-university that he believes enrich the learning experience.</p>
<div class="info_box">
<h4>Donors Claudia and Alec Webster support PICA's vision of social change</h4>
<p>Alum Alec Webster appreciates the satisfaction of hands-on work. That's part of why <a href="3406.xml">he and his wife Claudia support PICA.</a></p>
</div>
<p>PICA is home to 36 undergraduates who live in four prefab housing units in The Village housing area. Group meals are prepared in the dining commons three nights a week and after Saturday workdays. The heart of the community is the lovingly tended Foundational Roots Garden where students grow their own vegetables, fruits, and herbs.</p>
<p>The program resonates with a generation that has come of age in an era of school gardens, farmers' markets, bestselling books by Michael Pollan and Barbara Kingsolver, and food scares that have made "know where your food comes from" a mantra among consumers.</p>
<p>"Before they get here, students are aware of the issues," said Gliessman. "They've grown up with an emphasis on organic food, and they want to carry it on. These kids want to be part of the change."</p>
<p>Dugan discovered PICA when he enrolled in Gliessman's two-credit seminar at the end of his freshman year. Students meet once a week to learn about food systems, and in the garden to receive hands-on instruction in all aspects of organic gardening. Each class ends with a group meal.</p>
<p>"I didn't really know much about PICA, but it was a really beautiful place, and I said, 'Wow, I'm moving here,'" he recalled. Nearly two years later, Dugan slings compost; harvests cool-weather crops like collard greens, kale, and chard; and earnestly describes picking and drying the heirloom beans and sweet corn that will be the basis of many winter meals for the PICA community. True to agroecological principles, the garden mimics a natural ecosystem with softly defined planting beds, a mix of crops and flowering perennials that attract beneficial insects, and shady areas that protect plants from the blazing summer sun.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of ways to reconnect to nature and the earth. This is a really important one," he said. "There's the beauty and functionality, but something else feeds the spirit. There's just something about being part of the cycles of nature, and part of the cycles of your own life by producing your own food."</p>
<p>Dugan, a junior majoring in environmental studies, marvels at what the group can accomplish, joking that it "doesn't seem mathematically possible" that he has to help cook only once a month in exchange for the pleasure of enjoying a home-cooked dinner three nights a week. "So much more gets done with everybody contributing a little bit," he said.</p>
<p>Like the garden itself, conversations around the dinner table tend to unfold organically as students explore topics of interest to them: Can organic agriculture feed the world? Can meat be part of a sustainable diet? Are animal products acceptable? What is the role of animals in sustainable agriculture?</p>
<p>Even the topic of sustainability is open to debate. Gliessman defines sustainability as an approach to life based on treating the land in an ecologically sound way, but he hastens to add that it must also encompass a socially and economically just system that treats people, land, animals, and water in "a way that lasts forever."</p>
<p>"It's about healthy food, healthy land, and healthy people, and it's going to require some social changes," he said.</p>
<p>Others pretty much avoid the term, saying it has been been "thrown around a little too much."</p>
<p>"People try to be open to other people's personal choices, so it works," Dugan said of dietary preferences, which range from vegan to gluten-free to omnivore, but that same spirit of tolerance underlies the PICA community.</p>
<p>"PICA seems like a utopian ideal," said Marion Clark, a 29-year-old re-entry student from Los Angeles who joined PICA this fall after commuting to UCSC from Palo Alto for two quarters. "We really take care of each other. It feels like my family."</p>
<p>"I'm back in school because I'm looking to be inspired," she added. "At PICA, it's not just a class. It becomes your hobby and your pastime."</p>
<p>Clark is a raw-food enthusiast whose recent raw-dessert workshop attracted so many people that she had to offer a second class. "I love being able to walk into the garden and see where my food came from," she said.</p>
<p>Whether they're majoring in environmental studies, sociology, art, or engineering, PICA students share a desire to make the world a better place. Clark's mother founded the nonprofit Surf Bus Foundation, which takes youth from some of LA's most troubled neighborhoods on field trips to the beach. Marion dreams of creating a similar program to bring at-risk kids closer to the source of their food. "Making your own food, growing it, that's the ultimate in sustainability," she said. "I want to see more kids be a part of it."</p>
<p>Although PICA focuses on food production, workshops have addressed other aspects of sustainable living, including alternative energy, rainwater catchment, and waste management. Students installed solar panels and have embraced Gliessman's initiative to install a flagship solar-powered "green kitchen."</p>
<p>Gliessman is, for many PICA students, a role model and an inspiration. "He's the most inspiring professor I've met so far. He has an incredible amount of knowledge and experience, and he's had a lot of influence in his field, as well as at the university," said Dugan. "And he's also just like a real guy. He's really humble."</p>
<p>The next step for PICA? "We need to continue spreading the word about what's happening," said Dugan, "because this is one of the coolest things on campus now."</p>

Thursday ended peacefully when approximately 70 individuals inside the building at that time left voluntarily. Their departure followed a demand from UC police that they vacate the premises or face arrest for unlawful assembly and trespass.</p>
<p>There were no arrests. Students who participated in this incident face possible criminal and/or student judicial sanctions.</p>
<p>Certain areas of Kerr, particularly the second floor, were left damaged and in disarray. It will take much of today to document and assess the damage. The building will not be ready to be occupied on Monday; the second floor may remain closed for days.</p>
<p>Police reported one injury to a bystander who apparently fell as a crowd of onlookers on the Kerr plaza was dispersing at the request of police.</p>
<p>We want to express appreciation to Student Affairs staff and University police for displaying extraordinary poise and restraint in dealing with such a volatile situation; to Bill Ladusaw, professor of linguistics and vice provost of undergraduate education, and Peggy Delaney, professor of ocean sciences and interim Vice Chancellor of Planning and Budget, and others who participated in hours of dialogue seeking a peaceful, non-confrontational end to this incident; and to several other faculty, including Professor Bettina Aptheker, for their efforts this morning to persuade protesters to leave Kerr without further incident.</p>
<p>Most of all, we want to express appreciation to the vast majority of UCSC students, faculty, staff and others who continue to so patiently cope with continued campus disruptions by a relative few. This great university, now more than ever, needs and deserves our collective constructive efforts, not destructive acts.</p>

That's enough to provide 2,750 meals to hungry residents of Santa Cruz County.</p><p>"Part of my goal was to give the residents an opportunity to give back to the community," said Gonzalez, a fourth-year student who volunteers at Sunshine Villa as part of the psychology major's field-study requirement. "One of the residents used to volunteer, and I know she wishes she could do more of the community-based things she used to do. I wanted them to have a chance to make a contribution." </p><p>The success of the fundraiser exceeded Gonzalez's wildest expectations, and gave a boost to the artists, who sold more than 30 paintings.</p><p>"They really liked it," said Gonzalez. "They were really proud to see their art displayed, and they were pretty thrilled to see their names on paintings with 'sold' tags."</p><p>Each week up to a dozen budding Van Goghs gather together, raise their brushes, and create works in acrylic, watercolor, and tempera paints. Although at least one resident had some formal art training, others discovered their talent late in life. Howard Folger began painting last year--at the age of 100.</p><p>"They really enjoy art, and I enjoy watching them," said Gonzalez. "There's a lot of talent there." </p><p>Paintings by more than a dozen residents were matted and displayed in Sunshine Villa's lobby for a week before the November 8 sale. </p><p>After the sale, Darcy Yaley, Sunshine Villa's activity director, promptly made out a check for $550 to Second Harvest. "It was a lot of fun," said Yaley. "I had a great time, and the residents loved it. And the people who were fortunate enough to get the artwork really loved it."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915e6ef08072704601a012fffe633862"><name>3406</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Donors Claudia and Alec Webster support PICA's vision of social change </title><summary>Alum Alec Webster appreciates the satisfaction of hands-on work.

That's part of why he and his wife Claudia support the <a href="http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/pica.html">Program in Community and Agroecology</a> (PICA).</p><p>"You never see people smile as much as when they hold up something they've made," said Webster (B.A. environmental studies, College Eight, 2002), an engineer and former machinist with the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics.</p><p>For years, Alec and Claudia Webster, a former K-12 art teacher, have embraced PICA and supported it with generous grants from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.</p><p>"One of the things we want PICA to do is create environmental educators," said Webster. "We want to help create a base of college students who will go out into the world and get involved."</p><p>As an undergraduate re-entry student, Alec Webster took Steve Gliessman's classes on agroecology and soil. The two men reconnected at a UCSC alumni event, and the Websters embraced Gliessman's vision of social change through a small living-and-learning community focused around food. </p><p>"Claudia and I talk a lot about how people don't know how anything is made anymore, where anything comes from, or where anything goes when we're done with it," said Webster. "Agroecology is a good tool because people learn where food is grown, how to prepare it, and how to transform food waste into compost. We support hands-on, experience-based learning, because we don't think young people get virtually any of that anymore--certainly not enough. They're all learning how to take tests now."</p><p>The Websters also support the Life Lab Science Program, the Community Agroecology Network (CAN), and the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. </p><p>"What happened to our generation?" wondered Webster, 58. "We were going to make all these changes, but we didn't do it. Things have gotten worse."</p><p>By instilling a vision of sustainable living and providing hands-on learning opportunities, PICA supports UCSC students who want to make a change in the world. The Websters hope their support will raise the profile of PICA on campus and make the program available to more students.</p><p>"These people still have the energy to make change, and we'd like UCSC to stay the kind of place where people are encouraged to think and try to make a difference," said Webster. "As a society, we have tremendous issues. This is where we're going to make changes--with people."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915e7e648072704601a012ff42286161"><name>3409</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Affairs update on end of Kerr Hall occupation </title><start-date>1258959600000</start-date><display-name>Student Affairs update on...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3409</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3409</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339143215</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339143215</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As Chancellor Blumenthal and Campus Provost Kliger described in their message to the UCSC community, after several days, the occupation of Kerr Hall ended on Sunday morning. About 70 individuals voluntarily left the building, following directions from UC police. The damage was extensive and some pieces of equipment are broken beyond repair. The cleaning and restoration work to the building will require significant resources from already stretched budgets.</p><p>While there were no arrests at Kerr Hall, students who participated in the unlawful demonstration may be subject to student judicial and/or criminal sanctions. We value First Amendment rights; however, the occupation of Kerr Hall violated University policies.</p><p>We are disappointed that the actions of a relative few have impacted the thousands of other students as well as faculty and staff and disrupted the work of the University the protesters are seeking to protect. Not only are there financial costs, but the people who really lose are students who are engaged in programming and other events that have been canceled, delayed, or rescheduled due to this disruptive activity. Blocking access to roads means students cannot get to class, occupying buildings takes away focus on other student programming, and interrupting lectures impedes learning for students who want to actively participate in their education.</p><p>I understand your frustration about the budget crisis, fee hikes, and reduced services on campus. I also recognize that many of you are equally frustrated with the methods that protesters are using to express their discontent. We remain committed to working with students on managing our resources and including the student voice in budget planning and decision-making. It is important for all members of the UCSC community to continue to freely engage in instruction, research, and co-curricular activities.</p><p>Thank you for your patience and continued resolve to make UCSC a premier living-learning community. Best wishes for a restful Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Student Community </audience><admin>Felicia McGinty, Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915e8d1a8072704601a012ff0b88fb34"><name>3412</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal Review/Employee Comment - Outside Professional Activities Policy for Senior Management Group Members</title><start-date>1259046000000</start-date><display-name>Formal Review/Employee Comment -...</display-name><path>/2009/11/3412</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/3412</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339146976</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339146976</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University invites your comments on the proposed Outside Professional Activities Policy for Senior Management Group Members (SMG), which was discussed by The Regents on November 19, 2009.</p><p>The proposed Outside Professional Activities policy was developed as part of the ongoing review of the University's policies and practices on senior management compensation that was initiated at the request of the Regents in response to the findings of the Task Force on UC Compensation, Accountability, and Transparency.

Led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the study involved detailed observations of the rewiring processes that take place in the brain during motor learning.</p><p>The researchers studied mice as they were trained to reach through a slot to get a seed. They observed rapid growth of structures that form connections (called synapses) between nerve cells in the motor cortex, the brain layer that controls muscle movements. </p><p>"We found very quick and robust synapse formation almost immediately, within one hour of the start of training," said Yi Zuo, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC. </p><p>Zuo's team observed the formation of structures called "dendritic spines" that grow on pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex. The dendritic spines form synapses with other nerve cells. At those synapses, the pyramidal neurons receive input from other brain regions involved in motor memories and muscle movements. The researchers found that growth of new dendritic spines was followed by selective elimination of pre-existing spines, so that the overall density of spines returned to the original level.</p><p>"It's a remodeling process in which the synapses that form during learning become consolidated, while other synapses are lost," Zuo said. "Motor learning makes a permanent mark in the brain. When you learn to ride a bicycle, once the motor memory is formed, you don't forget. The same is true when a mouse learns a new motor skill; the animal learns how to do it and never forgets."</p><p>Understanding the basis for such long-lasting memories is an important goal for neuroscientists, with implications for efforts to help patients recover abilities lost due to stroke or other injuries. </p><p>"We initiated the motor learning studies to understand the process that takes place after a stroke, when patients have to relearn how to do certain things. We want to find out if there are things we can do to speed up the recovery process," Zuo said.</p><p>The lead authors of the <i>Nature</i> paper, Tonghui Xu and Xinzhu Yu, are a postdoctoral researcher and doctoral student, respectively, in Zuo's lab at UCSC. Coauthors include Andrew Perlik, Willie Tobin, and Jonathan Zweig of UCSC and Kelly Tennant and Theresa Jones of the University of Texas, Austin.</p><p>The study used mice that had been genetically altered to make a fluorescent protein within certain neurons in the brain. The researchers were then able to use a special microscopy technique (two-photon microscopy) to obtain clear images of those neurons near the surface of the brain. The noninvasive imaging technique enabled them to view changes in individual brain cells of the mice before, during, and after the mice were trained in the seed-reaching task.</p><p>"We were able to follow the same synapses over time, which had not been done before in a motor learning study," Zuo said. "We showed that structural changes occur in the brain at a much earlier stage than people had believed."</p><p>Results from the study suggested that the newly formed dendritic spines are initially unstable and undergo a prolonged selection process during the course of training before being converted into stable synapses.</p><p>When previously trained mice were reintroduced to the reaching task four months later, their skill at the task remained high, and images of their brains did not show increased spine formation. When previously trained mice were taught a new skill, however, they showed enhanced spine formation and elimination similar to that seen during the initial training. Furthermore, spines that had formed during the initial training persisted after the remodeling process that accompanied the learning of a new task. </p><p>These findings suggest that different motor behaviors are stored using different sets of synapses in the brain, Zuo said. One of the questions she would like to explore in future studies is how these findings apply to different types of learning.</p><p>"In China, where I grew up, we memorize a lot in school. What are the changes that take place in the brain during learning and memorizing, and what are the best ways to consolidate those memories? We don't really know the best way to learn and memorize," she said.</p><p>This work was supported by grants from the Ellison Medical Foundation, the DANA Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a26d92a28072704601a012ffffac6fa1"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2009/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625344045</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625344045</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-page id="5a958ace80727046005a8803a9d608c6"><name>3316</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Legendary "man-eating" lions of Tsavo likely ate about 35 people--not 135, say scientists</title><summary>The notorious "man-eating lions of Tsavo" that terrorized a railroad camp in Kenya in 1898 likely consumed about 35 people--far fewer than popular estimates.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495;

The study also yields surprises about the predatory behavior of lions.</p><p>Despite the notoriety of the attacks--the harrowing nine-month saga has been the subject of three Hollywood films, and the lions remain a popular exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago--the number of victims has been a matter of dispute. The new study, "Cooperation and Individuality Among Man-Eating Lions," appears in the Nov. 2 issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. The research utilized a sophisticated stable-isotope analysis to investigate this vexing question.</p><p>By analyzing samples of the hair and bone of the lions, researchers were able to estimate that one lion likely ate 11 humans and the other consumed 24 people during the animals' final nine months. Both lions were shot and killed in December 1898 by Lt. Col. John H. Patterson, a British officer and engineer hired to restore safety in the region. For years after, Patterson, who gained great notoriety for the feat, claimed the lions had killed 135 people--far more than the Ugandan Railway Company's estimate of 28 victims. </p><p>"This has been a historical puzzle for years, and the discrepancy is now finally being addressed," said Nathaniel J. Dominy, an associate professor of anthropology at UCSC. "We can imagine that the railroad company might have had reasons to want to minimize the number of victims, and Patterson might have had reasons to inflate the number. So who do you trust? We're removing all those factors and getting down to data."</p><p>Dominy and lead author Justin D. Yeakel, a doctoral candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, collaborated on the project with Bruce D. Patterson, the MacArthur Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum (no relation to John H. Patterson). </p><p>To investigate each lion's lifetime dietary patterns, Yeakel analyzed samples of their bone collagen and hair keratin that were provided by the Field Museum. He then compared those data to the isotopic signatures of the lions' presumptive prey, including modern grazing and browsing animals, and humans. Human samples were obtained from the remains of Kenya's Taita population that were gathered by anthropologist Louis Leakey during his famous East African Archaeological Expedition of 1929. </p><p>The results suggest that during the final months of what John Patterson described as the lions' "reign of terror," fully half of one lion's diet consisted of humans, with the balance made up of mid-sized grazing animals such as gazelles and impala. Strikingly, the other lion ate very few humans, subsisting instead on herbivores. That dietary disparity leads Dominy and Yeakel to infer that the Tsavo lions worked together to scatter everyone, both humans and wild game, setting the stage for one to gorge on humans and the other to feed on herbivores.</p><p>"The idea that the two lions were going in as a team yet exhibiting these dietary preferences has never been seen before or since," said Dominy. </p><p>Cooperative hunting is beneficial when lions are stalking large prey like Cape buffalo and zebra, but humans are small enough that lions don't typically need to work together to make a kill. In this case, an array of conditions may have temporarily altered the lions' behavior, including drought and disease that depleted the availability of the lions' conventional prey. In addition, large numbers of people and animals had gathered for the railroad project, and severe dental problems and a jaw injury suffered by one of the lions probably greatly inhibited its ability to hunt.</p><p>"These findings underscore the complexity of what lions are capable of doing, and the complex interplay of costs and benefits that determine the size of their coalitions," he said.</p><p>The stark dietary differences highlight the importance of considering individuals within populations, said Yeakel. "In ecology, we often think of a population as being the sum of its parts, but there can be really rich things happening among individuals in a population," he said. "It's a new way of thinking about how populations work to consider how individuals affect the whole."</p><p>More than a century after the attacks, the Tsavo lions remain notorious; last year, the National Museum of Kenya began an effort to recover the remains of the lions, saying they represent an important part of the country's history and heritage. The grisly chapter finally ended in December 1898, when John Patterson--after nine months spent in pursuit of the animals--shot and killed one lion, then killed the second lion 20 days later. During the final three months of the nine-month siege, lion attacks were a "nightly occurrence," and work on the railroad expansion had ground to a halt as terrified laborers refused to work, said Dominy, noting that the delay prompted the first and only mention of lions in Britain's House of Parliament as members demanded an explanation for the work stoppage.</p><p>Ending the terror earned John Patterson widespread and enduring fame, but Dominy wonders if the boastful hunter might have exaggerated his estimate of victims to enhance his own reputation. "The railroad company attributed the deaths of 28 Indian nationals to the lions, and Patterson may have reasonably assumed scores of Africans were also killed," said Dominy. "But based on our statistical analysis, there's an outside chance they ate as many as 75 people. Our evidence attests only to the number of people eaten, not the number of people killed."</p><p>In 1924, John Patterson sold the hides of the lions--which he had used as rugs--to the Field Museum, where taxidermists restored and stuffed the pelts and mounted a diorama that continues to fascinate museum visitors today. Patterson's 1907 book, The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, was an international bestseller when it was published, and it remains in print today.</p><p>"The fact that we can determine both the diet and the behavior of two animals killed more than a century ago is a testament to the enduring value of museum collections and the science that interprets them," said Field Museum curator Bruce Patterson. "The rather extravagant claims (Colonel) Patterson made in his book can now be pretty much dismissed."</p><p>For Dominy, downgrading the number of human victims of the Tsavo lions is the latest chapter in a legend that takes a new turn with the insights about lion predation offered by these animals. The path of human evolution has been shaped by predation, said Dominy, noting that the efficiency benefits of bipedalism are gained at the cost of speed, making humans vulnerable to quick, four-legged predators, including lions.</p><p>"In a discussion of bipedalism, Louis Leakey once said, 'People are not cat food,' " said Dominy. "But they are. This study proves that."</p><p>In addition to Dominy, Yeakel, and Bruce Patterson, coauthors on the paper are Kena Fox-Dobbs, assistant professor of geology at the University of Puget Sound; Mercedes M.
