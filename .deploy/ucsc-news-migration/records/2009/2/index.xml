That effort will be boosted by CIWR's recent acquisition of three water-treatment units from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The equipment, originally used at U.S. military bases, became available after base re-alignment following the end of the Cold War.  </p><p>The units will give students and CIWR researchers the opportunity to operate water-treatment systems very similar to ones currently in use by water utilities, and CIWR affiliates will be able to conduct cutting-edge research that contributes to the ever-growing number of water-treatment technologies in use, according to Haddad, who has established a joint venture with the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency and the Marina Coast Water District. Called the Water Teaching and Research Laboratory, or WaterLab, the collaboration will facilitate training and development opportunities.</p><p>Industry experts agreed that hands-on experience is a valuable addition to theoretical training. Already, Haddad and his students have combined practical fundamentals and theory: Several students are scheduled to take state-administered exams to become certified in water treatment and distribution. Haddad plans to take the exams himself, jesting "I'm kind of worried about my score."</p><p>Dennis, also representing the California-Nevada section of the industry group American Water Works Association (AWWA), was eager to expand student interest in the water sector. Haddad encourages his students to participate in AWWA events to meet practitioners in the field; he and Dennis also made plans to build connections between students and younger professional members of AWWA through social mixers and other events. </p><p>Formally recognized by UCSC in June 2007, CIWR's mission is to advance society's understanding of the policy, economics, and communication of freshwater management.

Many of us remember Noel's lively presence on campus and his commanding lecture style on the subject of his expertise: comparative religious studies.</p>
<p>Hired by the campus shortly after it opened in the 1960s, Noel was an extraordinarily popular teacher and widely respected scholar, continuing to publish extensively well after his retirement in 1991 as a professor of history and comparative religion.</p>
<p>For many years, Noel advocated for a range of courses for students interested in learning about religion in an academic setting. And, for those students who were pursuing a religious studies major, Noel provided foundation classes with an emphasis on a comparative approach to the subject.</p>
<p>Information about a memorial service will be posted on a site the family is creating at: <a href="http://nqking.wordpress.com/">nqking.wordpress.com/</a>. Visitors to that site may also leave comments and remembrances.</p>
<p>His family has begun preparing Noel's obituary, which includes information about a memorial fund in his honor. By Monday, his wife, Laurie King, had written the following about her late husband. The completed family obituary will be posted on this web site later this week.</p>

<br/>
<p>Noel Q. King died Sunday at his home in the Santa Cruz mountains after a long illness. Noel was an Anglo-Indian, born in Rawalpindi in 1922, educated in Simla, Oxford, and Nottingham. He served in the British Army during the second world war, mostly dropping air supplies over Burma, then went to St. Peter's in Oxford to study history and theology. After his D. Phil and ordination, he was hired by first Ghana and then Uganda, to help set up departments of religious studies in the new universities of Accra and Makerere. He came to the new University of California campus in Santa Cruz in 1967, with the same purpose.</p>
<p>Noel taught at UCSC until his retirement in 1991, in religious studies and history. After he retired, he remained active in the community of the world's religions, particularly among the Sikhs.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Laurie; six children scattered from Santa Cruz to England and Australia; eleven grandchildren; and 4 great-grandchildren. He is also remembered by the generations of students around the world whose lives he touched.</p>
<p>Memorials to his life will be held in Santa Cruz and Oxford. If you wish to make a donation in Noel's name, we suggest the Noel Q. King Memorial Fund at UCSC, dedicated to the study of the world's religions. Send checks made to UCSC Foundation (with Noel's name as the memo) to: Liz Sandoval, Humanities Dean's Office, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064.</p>

The $200-a-plate event sold out weeks ago.</p><p>"More than a third of our students are the first in their family to attend college," Blumenthal told the gathering of community leaders, students, and community college and university officials. "Many are from disadvantaged families," he said. "Your support makes a huge difference for these students and their families." </p><p>One of those students, Catalina Berumen, remembered the pride she felt when she told her mother, a housecleaner, and her father, a gardener, that she had won a Pister scholarship to UCSC when she transferred from San Mateo College. </p><p>"My scholarship was the catapult, the reason I have a story of pride and success to tell you," Berumen said. Now a third grade bilingual teacher in Virginia, Berumen joined approximately two dozen other Pister Scholars in thanking and honoring the Pisters for their dedicated efforts in providing scholarships. Pister founded the Leadership Opportunity Awards in 1993. It offers $20,000 scholarships to junior transfer students from 13 regional community colleges.</p><p>After showering the Pisters with accolades, Blumenthal presented them with a framed photograph of themselves outside university house. Earlier in the evening the UCSC Women's Club honored Rita Pister for establishing a scholarship program for re-entry students. </p><p>Pister credited several staff members by name for their help in making the Leadership Opportunity Awards a success. He later recalled how he cobbled together the initial funds to create the endowment that supports the program. </p><p>Berumen, who graduated in 1995 as one of the first-year Pister Scholars, returned to UCSC three years later for her teaching credential and masters in education. She taught at Starlight and Alianza schools in Watsonville before moving to Virginia in 2003.</p><p>Five current or former UC chancellors attended the dinner. Blumenthal and Pister, chancellor from 1991-96, were joined by M.R.C Greenwood, chancellor from 1996 to 2004; Marty Chemers, acting chancellor from 2004-05; and Sung-Mo "Steve" Kang, now chancellor at UC Merced. Kang previously was dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>Edgar Marin, of Watsonville, a senior literature major, and one of 15 children, attended the dinner, accompanied by his mother. Several years out of high school, Marin attended Cabrillo College, where he won a Pister LOA scholarship to attend UCSC. Marin said he aspires to become a professor and continue the cycle of opportunity for disadvantaged students. </p><p>Ticket sales and sponsorships raised more than $165,000, and donations are still coming in.

With this grant, the CIRM funding awarded to UCSC now totals $19.4 million from nine grants, all managed by the campus's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE).</p>
<p>The governing board chose not to approve immediate funding for the new grants due to the current financial situation in California and the state's inability to sell bonds on the public market. Instead, they voted on the grants they would like to see funded when the financial situation is resolved.</p>
<p>The tentatively approved grants in CIRM's Research Training Program II will provide a total of $40.6 million to fund graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and clinical fellows working in stem cell research labs throughout the state. At UCSC, the funding will support four graduate students and six postdoctoral researchers for three years.</p>
<p>"These trainees are our future stem cell scientists," said Alan Trounson, president of CIRM. "With these awards we are establishing a strong next generation of researchers and physician scientists to continue developing new stem cell-based therapies."</p>
<p>An earlier grant supporting six trainees at UCSC is due to expire this year. Ann Pace, associate director of CBSE, said the new funding will support a significant expansion of the training program.</p>
<p>"Training students is a big part of our mission, and our trainees will gain the knowledge and skills they need to contribute to the advancement of stem cell medicine," Pace said.</p>
<p>The UCSC program in Systems Biology of Stem Cells will feature formal and supplemental education in a collaborative, interdisciplinary biomedical research environment. It brings together the unique strengths of faculty with expertise in key areas for advancing basic stem cell research. Faculty mentors from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering will be involved in the program.</p>
<p>CBSE director David Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, will serve as program director. Associate directors are Manuel Ares, William Sullivan, and John Tamkun, all professors of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, and Camilla Forsberg, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>

<p>The episode will be rebroadcast tonight (Friday, February 6) at 8:30 p.m. on Comedy Central.</p>
<p>The researchers from <a href="http://www.topp.org">Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP)</a> named a couple of the animals they've been tracking after Colbert and fellow Comedy Central anchor Jon Stewart, calling them Stelephant Colbert and Jon Sealwart. They also gave them Facebook pages and funny <a href="http://www.topp.org/topp_blog">blogs</a>. The goal was to have fun, but also to engage the public in marine science and spread the word about the information and data they were gathering from the high-tech tracking devices they attached to the seals.</p>
<p>The story of Stelephant Colbert and Jon Sealwart &#8212; along with other seals named by students at local elementary schools &#8212;&#160;<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2704">was promoted by UC Santa Cruz</a> in late January, as the seals hit their annual mating and molting hotspot, A&#241;o Nuevo State Natural Reserve.</p>
<p>The <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> featured the story, followed by Associated Press; it subsequently appeared in newspapers such as <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>Orange County Register</i>, and the <i>Fresno Bee</i>. It also spread virally among Colbert and Stewart fans, making it onto the home page of Colbert's site, <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/home">Colbert Nation</a>, and on the online news segment of Stewart's site, the <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a>.</p>

<p>Noxon received her award as part of the writing team for the hit TV show <em>Mad Men</em>, which beat out competitors <em>The Wire, Friday Night Lights, Lost</em>, and <em>Dexter</em>.</p>
<p>The annual Writers Guild Awards honor the best film, television and videogame writers of the past year.</p>
<p>Noxon is a 1987 graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a degree in theater arts.</p>
<p>Best known as writer and executive producer for <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, Noxon's television credits include <em>Grey's Anatomy, Brothers &amp; Sisters, Point Pleasant, Prison Break, Still Life</em> and <em>Angel</em>.</p>
<p>Noxon also co-wrote the 1999 film <em>Just a Little Harmless Sex</em>, starring Alison Eastwood, Jonathan Silverman, Rachel Hunter, and Lauren Hutton.</p>
<p><em>Mad Men</em> has received rave reviews for its authenticity and style since it premiered in 2007, earning numerous awards--including three Golden Globes and six Emmys.</p>
<p>Set in New York City's Madison Avenue during the 1960s, the series tracks the lives of the ruthlessly competitive and ego-driven men and women of a fictional advertising agency--deftly illustrating the changing social attitudes of the country during that period.</p>

<p>During the month of March, Hula's will donate 10 percent of its sales on Monday nights to the men's volleyball team.</p>
<p>The men's volleyball team at UC Santa Cruz is currently ranked #2 nationally in the BISON/AVCA DIII Poll. Led by setter Eric Rowell (Los Gatos, CA) and outside hitters Matt Smiley (Aptos, CA), Justin Lam (San Francisco, CA), and Brad Sullivan (Saratoga, CA) the team looks to make a run at a national championship.</p>
<p>Hula's specializes in steaks and seafood with a hint of Asian, a dash of Latin, and a touch of Caribbean, all with Hawaiian inspiration.</p>

Mellon Foundation.</p><p>UC Press's <i>FlashPoints</i> will split the award with Fordham University Press, University of Pennsylvania Press, University of Virginia Press, and University of Washington Press. Each will receive one-fifth of the total grant to publish scholarly books on the literatures of the non-English world. </p><p>"It's a global initiative-the presses are American, but the projects can come from any scholar in the world," noted Terdiman. "This grant reaffirms the importance of literary scholarship and the study of the humanities."</p><p>Over the next five years, the "Modern Language Initiative" collaborative grant will support the publication of 20 titles by each press. </p><p>"Despite the increasing consciousness of the United States's role as part of the community of nations, opportunities for publication of books dealing with non-English cultures have been significantly declining," Terdiman added. "The Mellon Foundation grant will dramatically help reverse this decline."</p><p>While each of the five presses will keep their own editorial profile and acquisitions procedures, the copyediting, production and marketing will all be centralized. The goal is to offer authors a shared space for publishing innovative scholarship that will influence the way literature and language arts are researched and taught.</p><p>Terdiman directs the editorial group for the UC Press's <i>FlashPoints</i> series which includes four UC faculty editors: literature professor Susan Gillman from UC Santa Cruz; two editors from UC Berkeley; and one from UC Irvine. </p><p>He noted that the <i>FlashPoints</i> publication series is based on an unusual academic model that was developed at UC Santa Cruz and features two fundamental innovations.</p><p>"Instead of the usual university press model-based on an in-house acquisitions editor specific to a particular discipline-we thought it would be best to have faculty editors responsible for the acquisition of manuscripts," said Terdiman, "because of their expertise and the fact that faculty are so well-connected across the country."</p><p>In addition, each <i>FlashPoints</i> book will be published in a dual format-as a free digital edition, which will allow the work to reach a broader international audience, and also as a traditional softcover book.</p><p>"UC Santa Cruz has been at the forefront of this initiative since 2001 in shaping the model for the future of academic publications in the digital age," said Terdiman. "All of the books will be made instantly available on the web in their entirety-along with additional resources such as photos and links to original sources."</p><p>								</p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159b1c78072704601a012ff34f2a1f8"><name>2726</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recreation classes offered in leadership, communications</title><summary>UCSC Recreation is presenting a series of classes on outdoor trip leadership, a course on defensive driving, and another on effective communication and conflict resolution.  &#13;

<p>"Let me say that I know how hard people are working with the increased demands on our time, and I want you to know how much I appreciate it, the senior management appreciates it, and the campus as a whole appreciates it, as well," Blumenthal began.</p>
<p>After noting recent successes such as the Scholarship Benefit Dinner, which raised more than $165,000 for scholarships, and Dining Services' recent win of a $5,000 grant, Blumenthal plunged directly into the budget.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, right now, we can't avoid the uncertainty we're living in," he said, noting that universities across the nation are struggling to remain afloat in the global economic meltdown. For example, he said, Brandeis University is considering closing its museum and selling its artwork.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, we're not sitting on our hands here," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger is evaluating two aspects of the campus budget. The first is determining how to implement mid-year budget cuts to the campus totaling approximately $6 million.</p>
<p>EVC Kliger will consult with the Committee on Planning and Budget and principal officers over the next few weeks before determining the reduction that will be assigned to each division, Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>The other aspect is planning for a yet-to-be-determined permanent budget reduction that will be implemented for 2009-10.</p>
<p>"The exact magnitude of this cut will be dependent on the state budget as well as mandated cost increases," said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>By mid-March, Kliger hopes to finalize a proposal for implementing strategic, targeted reductions across campus to be implemented in the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>That said, the chancellor emphasized that the campus will focus its resources to maintain quality and momentum; it will protect critical core missions, continue to make strategic hires, invest in philanthropy and a comprehensive campaign, and continue to strengthen its presence in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Regarding pensions, the Regents voted to resume contributions in April 2010, said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>This will start with a 4 percent employer contribution and a 2 percent employee contribution (though contributions from union represented employees are subject to collective bargaining).</p>
<p>Initially, this will have no impact on employee net take-home pay because funds will be redirected from the mandatory employee contributions currently going into the UC Defined Contribution Plan.</p>
<p>Staff asked questions on topics including shared governance of the pension plan, changes to the Arts &amp; Lectures program, approaches to budget cuts, union negotiations, and how the state budget situation will affect campus construction.</p>
<p>The Digital Arts building is still under construction, and the campus already received almost all the money for it that was promised by the state, Blumenthal said. But the renovation and addition project to McHenry Library may be stalled because of a freeze on state money for capital projects. Construction of the Biomedical Sciences Building may also be delayed.</p>

Conditions are "nightmarish," with many facilities now holding twice as many inmates as they were built to accommodate. Haney described cavernous gymnasiums converted to housing units, where tight rows of double- and triple-bed bunks extend "as far as the eye can see," precluding any privacy and making supervision impossible. </p><p>On February 9, the judges called for a reduction to between 120 percent and 145 percent of the prison system's capacity, which would reduce the population by approximately 40,000 inmates over the next three years. The announcement came in the form of a tentative ruling, designed to give the state an opportunity to develop a plan to reduce the population to required levels.</p><p>In his report, Haney, an expert on inmate mental health, described the various ways in which overcrowding was preventing the prison system from providing constitutionally required medical and mental health care. His report included accounts of interviews he conducted with many desperately mentally ill and even suicidal inmates whose needs were being ignored because of dire space and staff shortages that plague the system. Rates of inmate suicide appear to be escalating, and recidivism rates in the state are among the highest in the country, he noted.</p><p>Haney testified twice during the trial: once about the harmful consequences of the overcrowding he saw during tours he conducted of a number of the prisons, and a second time advising the judges that the prison system could not operate safely or humanely without a reduction in the population to absolutely no more than 145 percent of its capacity. </p><p>Prison experts believe the case is likely to be regarded as a landmark decision, in part because of its potential implications for other overcrowded systems around the county. It is also likely to be appealed by the state to the United States Supreme Court, said Haney.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159bae38072704601a012ff793a79ce"><name>2732</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Assistance for visitors coming to UC Santa Cruz this spring</title><start-date>1234508400000</start-date><display-name>Assistance for visitors coming...</display-name><path>/2009/02/2732</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/02/2732</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338831020</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338831020</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Spring is a crucial time of year for university-bound high school seniors and community college transfer students as they must decide where to enroll by May 1 or June 1. Our campus will see over 8,000 visitors during this period. This increasing number of visitors is good news for the campus and continues to show our campus' rising reputation and desirability. An outline of campus spring yield events can be found at <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springyield09">http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springyield09</a>.</p><p>In fall 2007, the campus admission rate (number of admit offers compared to total number of applications) was just over 80%, while last year it was 73%. For fall 2009 we anticipate another jump in selectivity with a projected admit rate of 65%. Demand for our campus has also risen during this time, with frosh yield rates (number of students accepting our offer of admission) climbing each year; in fact, last year's yield rate of 23% was the highest the campus has achieved this decade!</p><p>We are holding "UC Santa Cruz - Spring Spotlight" from April 3 to April 18. We only invite admitted students and their families to visit during this period, although we do plan to make some tour times available for prospective students as well because these weeks coincide with many students' spring breaks. Transfer-specific Spring Spotlight sessions will be held on April 9 and 16 at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. After admissions decisions are released March 15, if students contact you about campus tours, please refer them to the Admissions web site at <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu">http://admissions.ucsc.edu</a>, where they will find instructions for reserving a place in a Spring Spotlight or regular tour.</p><p>Student organizations have initiated their own outreach events to help welcome admitted students to the campus. The events will be held the weekend of April 9-11, and they include Destination Higher Education, sponsored by the African/Black Student Alliance; A Step Forward, sponsored by the Filipino Student Association; and Oportunidades Rumbo A La Educación (ORALE), sponsored by Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan (MEChA).</p><p>Our many April visitors will be curious about university life and academic opportunities, and may ask you many questions. Please be friendly and patient. Your helpfulness is a key indicator of our university community for these students and their families.

<p>That was the message delivered by guest speaker Van Jones at the 25th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation Thursday night.</p>
<p>The convocation, held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, drew an energetic and amped-up crowd of at least 2,000 people eager to hear Jones, a popular environmental activist who advocates for so-called "green-collar" jobs and opportunities for the disadvantaged.</p>
<p>This year's convocation came on a particularly auspicious day, said Chancellor George Blumenthal in his address before the keynote speech.</p>
<p>"It was 200 years ago today in a one-room Kentucky cabin that Abraham Lincoln was born," said Blumenthal. "It was 100 years ago today that a multiracial group of activists founded the NAACP in New York City."</p>
<p>And just weeks ago "another former Illinois state senator became president of the United States of America," said Blumenthal to applause.</p>
<p>Jones, author of <em>The Green Collar Economy,</em> is founding president of Green For All, an organization seeking to build a green economy that will simultaneously resolve the ecological crisis and lift millions out of poverty.</p>
<p>To do this, Jones told the convocation audience that we must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Renew our politics;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Reinvent our economy; and<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Re-create human civilization.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"How do we do that? Well, it would be impossible to even think about that if we didn't have the renewal of our politics well under way," Jones said, referring to the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States.</p>
<p>"That line we just crossed, that you thought was the finish line? That was the starting line," said Jones. "Now we get to have a movement. Now we get to show the world something. We're just getting started."</p>
<p>The model that led to the current economic meltdown contains three fallacies, according to Jones:</p>

<ul>
<li>That we could have consumption as the most important part of our economy rather than production; <br/>
<br/>


</li>
<li>That we could run the economy forever based on credit, rather than "smart savings and thrift, like our grandparents";<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>That we could run our economy based on ecological destruction rather than ecological restoration.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>But the green movement can save us, he said, and be the cornerstone for the next American economy, because we need to go back to producing something here.</p>
<p>"One of the things we can produce here is clean energy," he said. "And it's got to be something that respects the Earth."</p>
<p>The United States has "a Saudi Arabia" of wind and solar power, but we haven't connected our clean-energy power centers to our population centers.</p>
<p>"This is the most important work, the work that most needs to be done," said Jones. "If we can take the most important work, the work that most needs to be done, and connect it to the people who most need work--people coming home from prison, coming home from wars, coming out of high school with no pension ... That's how we can reinvent the economy."</p>
<p>Beating global warming will require greening our cities, said Jones, which means giving the people who live there the tools, training, and technology to weatherize and energy-retrofit millions of buildings.</p>
<p>"That's thousands of contracts and millions of jobs, which will radically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions because our coal-fired power plants won't have to work so hard," Jones said.</p>
<p>But the green economy is more than just installing solar panels and the like. It's a fundamental change of American behavior, Jones said.</p>
<p>"If all we do is change how we power the economy but we don't change how we deal with water and waste and food and toxins and each other, here's what you'll have: Solar-powered bulldozers, solar-powered buzz saws that chop down the forest ... biofueled bombers so we can fight wars for lithium for batteries rather than oil for engines," Jones said.</p>
<p>Inside the pro-democracy movement that's trying to become a green economy movement is a deeper seed, said Jones: "A desire to return to the true, right relationship with our mother, the Earth."</p>
<p>Before the keynote speech, convocation organizers presented the inaugural Tony Hill Award to Luis Alejo, a public-interest attorney and Watsonville City Councilman.</p>
<p>Hill, a prominent community activist who died in 2007, had served on the convocation planning committee for many years. The award selection committee received 14 nominations for someone in the community who demonstrated the hallmarks of Hill's life: mentor, inspirational leader, gifted mediator, and bridge-builder.</p>
<p>"Tony Hill reached out to his Latino brothers in Watsonville," said Alejo in his remarks to the audience. "When he passed away, we vowed to continue his work and his spirit."</p>

<p>David Haussler, CBSE director and distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering, said CBSE research teams are finding evidence that the early theories of Nobel Prize winner Barbara McClintock, later modeled by Roy Britten and Eric Davidson, are correct. Haussler discussed these findings February 14 in a presentation on "Transposon-induced rewriting of vertebrate gene regulation" at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago.</p>
<p>"Comparison of the human genome with the genomes of other species reveals that at least five percent of the human genome has been under negative selection during most of mammalian evolution," Haussler said. "We believe that this five percent is, therefore, likely to be functional."</p>
<p>Coding exons and structural RNA genes stand out because of their distinctive pattern of base substitutions and "indels"--the insertions and deletions of nucleic acid bases that can change the message in a genome. According to Haussler, however, most of the DNA under negative selection in vertebrate genomes does not appear to be transcribed and shares no sequence similarity with the genomes of invertebrates.</p>
<p>"Our research suggests that many of these elements serve as distal enhancers for developmental genes," Haussler said. "A significant amount of the gene regulatory material appears to have indeed been put into place by ancient transposons."</p>

But according to biochemist David Deamer of the University of California, Santa Cruz, their efforts are yielding clues to the mystery of how life began on Earth.</p>
<p>Deamer has been investigating the origin of life for more than 20 years, focusing on the molecular self-assembly processes that led to the first "protocells" nearly 4 billion years ago. At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, he discussed evolution, biochemistry, and the origin of cellular life. His presentation on February 15 was part of a symposium on evolution organized by Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, Calif.</p>
<p>According to Deamer, life began with complex systems of molecules that came together through the self-assembly of nonliving components. A useful metaphor for understanding how this came about, he said, can be found in combinatorial chemistry, an approach in which thousands of experiments are carried out in parallel by robotic devices.</p>
<p>"I look at the origin of life as the result of combinatorial chemistry on a global scale," said Deamer, a research professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC who is also affiliated with the Department of Biomolecular Engineering in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The power of combinatorial chemistry lies in the vast numbers of structurally distinct molecules that can be synthesized and tested at the same time. Similarly, conditions on the early Earth allowed not only the synthesis of a wide variety of complex organic molecules, but also the formation of membrane-bound compartments that would have encapsulated different combinations of molecules.</p>
<p>"We have made protocells in the lab--artificial compartments containing complex systems of molecules," Deamer said. "The creationists charge that it's too unlikely for the right combination to have come together on its own, but combinatorial chemistry gives us a better way to think about the probability of life emerging from this process."</p>
<p>Life began when one or a few protocells happened to have a mix of components that could capture energy and nutrients from the environment and use them to grow and reproduce. Efforts to replicate this process in the laboratory are still in their infancy, but Deamer said he is optimistic that scientists will eventually be able to assemble a living cell from a parts list and thereby achieve a better understanding of how life began.</p>
<p>The first forms of life did not evolve in the usual sense, he said, but simply grew. "Evolution began when large populations of cells had variations that led to different metabolic efficiencies," Deamer said. "If the populations were in a confined environment, at some point they would begin to compete for limited resources."</p>
<p>The first evolutionary selection processes would have favored those organisms that were most efficient in capturing energy and nutrients from the local environment, he said.</p>
<p>In his talk at the AAAS meeting, Deamer outlined the conditions that scientists think were necessary for life to emerge on the early Earth. He is currently working on a book about the origin of life to be published by UC Press.</p>

These findings are helping scientists understand the full spectrum of motions occurring on the fault and may yield new insights into the events that lead to major earthquakes.</p>
<p>A slow slip event involves the same fault motion as an earthquake, but it happens so slowly that the ground does not shake. It can be detected only with networks of modern instruments that use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to measure precisely the movements of the Earth's crust over time.</p>
<p>Susan Schwartz, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, leads a team that has installed a permanent network of 13 GPS monitoring stations and 13 seismic stations on Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula.</p>
<p>"At least two slow slip events have occurred beneath the Nicoya Peninsula since 2003," Schwartz said. "When we recorded the first one in 2003, we had only 3 GPS stations. By 2007, we had 12 GPS stations and over 10 seismic stations, so the event that year was very nicely recorded."</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has funded the work by Schwartz and others to install monitoring equipment in Costa Rica. Schwartz, who directs UCSC's Keck Seismological Laboratory, has been working in the region since 1991. In a presentation on February 15 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, she described results from the past decade of fault-zone monitoring in Central America.</p>
<p>"The newest discovery is the occurrence of these slow slip events. But there has been a decade of focused effort in this area that has significantly advanced our knowledge of the Central America seismogenic system," Schwartz said. "Initially, we focused on areas of the fault that are locked up, which slip in an earthquake. The slow slip is occurring in regions that are not strongly locked, and a big question is whether that is loading the locked area, making it more likely to break, or relieving stress on the fault."</p>
<p>Schwartz said she does not think slow slip events significantly increase the likelihood of a major earthquake on a locked portion of the fault. She noted, however, that scientists are still at an early stage in terms of understanding the implications of different kinds of fault motion and translating that information into earthquake hazard assessments.</p>
<p>Flanked by active tectonic margins on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, Costa Rica is one of the most earthquake-prone and volcanically active countries in the world. Just off the west coast is the Middle America Trench, where a section of the seafloor called the Cocos Plate dives beneath Central America, generating powerful earthquakes and feeding a string of active volcanoes. This type of boundary between two converging plates of the Earth's crust is called a subduction zone--and such zones are notorious for generating the most powerful and destructive earthquakes.</p>
<p>The slow slip phenomenon was first observed at subduction zones where hundreds of GPS and seismic instruments are deployed: the Cascadia fault zone (off the coast of Washington and British Columbia) and Japan's Nankai Trough. At these and most other subduction zones, the part of the plate boundary where earthquakes originate, called the seismogenic zone, lies beneath the ocean. But in Costa Rica, the seismogenic zone runs right beneath the Nicoya Peninsula.</p>
<p>"It's a perfect opportunity to study the seismogenic zone using a network of land-based instruments," Schwartz said.</p>
<p>The 2007 slow slip event in Costa Rica involved movement along the fault equivalent to a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. But it took place over a period of 30 days rather than the 10 seconds typical for an earthquake of that size, and such slow motion does not radiate the seismic energy associated with normal earthquakes. The instruments did pick up seismic tremor, however, which Schwartz likened to a lot of very small earthquakes. Tremor activity is also associated with slow slip events in Japan and Cascadia, but there are some differences in Costa Rica, Schwartz said.</p>
<p>"Costa Rica has a different type of subduction zone from the well-studied ones in Japan and Cascadia," she said. "One thing that makes it interesting is that the temperature is much cooler at the depth range where slip occurs, and that is helping us work out the role of fluids in generating slow slip."</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of this research is not only a better understanding of subduction zones, but also better assessments of earthquake hazards. Schwartz said her Costa Rican colleagues have been working to educate the population of Nicoya about earthquakes and related hazards. With a growing population along the coast, the region faces a potential tsunami threat as well as the possibility of a major earthquake, she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159c4fe8072704601a012ffaf14056b"><name>2739</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Sandra Faber to receive Franklin Institute's prestigious Bower Award</title><summary>Astronomer Sandra Faber has been chosen to receive the 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science from the historic Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sandra Faber, Bower Award, Bower Prize, Franklin Institute</keywords><description>Astronomer Sandra Faber has been chosen to receive the 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science from the historic Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.</description><start-date>1234940400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Sandra Faber to...</display-name><path>/2009/02/2739</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/02/2739</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338833607</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338833607</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/02/images/faber_crop_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/02/images/faber_crop_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faber_crop_300.jpg</name><file-size>96781</file-size><width>300</width><height>292</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Astronomer Sandra Faber, with the Hubble Deep Field in the background.

It was established in 1990 through a bequest from Henry Bower, a Philadelphia chemical manufacturer, who also endowed an award for business leadership. </p><p>The Franklin Institute Awards Program dates back to 1824, when the institute was founded by a group of leading Philadelphians. The awards honor individuals whose great innovation has benefited humanity, advanced science, launched new fields of inquiry, and deepened our understanding of the universe. They are among the oldest and most prestigious comprehensive science awards in the world. </p><p>"Sandy Faber has had a profound influence on modern cosmology for more than a third of a century, and she is still going strong," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. "Sandy has a mind that probes to the core of all issues surrounding our knowledge of the universe, and it is this drive toward understanding which has led to the many important discoveries that have characterized her career."</p><p>Blumenthal, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, collaborated with Faber and UCSC physicist Joel Primack on groundbreaking research that established the role of dark matter in the formation of galaxies. Faber is renowned for this and other research on the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in the universe. She and a group of colleagues were the first to detect high-speed flows of galaxies on cosmic scales. She is currently involved in several projects, including a major survey of distant galaxies (the AEGIS survey), studies of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, and the development of adaptive optics systems to sharpen the images of groundbased telescopes.</p><p>A leading authority on telescopes and astronomical instrumentation, Faber has been closely involved with both the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Her many honors include Harvard University's Bok Prize, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, and election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. </p><p>Faber joined the UCSC faculty in 1972 and in 1995 was made University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system. She earned a B.A. in physics from Swarthmore College and a Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard University.</p><p>Faber will receive the Bower Award at a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 23. The Franklin Institute is also hosting a panel discussion on April 22 in her honor. The awards event, considered one of the preeminent social events in Philadelphia, crowns a week-long series of activities aimed at education and outreach to bring science to the community.</p><p>The Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science is presented annually to a distinguished member of the international scientific community for work in a prescribed discipline that changes every year. The year 2009 was designated for physics, and "the cosmos" was chosen as the theme. The Franklin Institute solicited external nominations, and Faber was chosen for the honor by a Bower International Selection Committee consisting of leaders in the field.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159c6498072704601a012ff26db5bd1"><name>2740</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renewable energy projects are in the works on campus</title><summary>This year, the campus is embarking on two pilot green-power projects: installing solar panels on the West Field House Gym and increasing the efficiency of the campus pool's heating system. </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>solar electric panels, solar thermal panels, Patrick Testoni</keywords><description>This year, the campus is embarking on two pilot green-power projects: installing solar panels on the West Field House Gym and increasing the efficiency of the campus pool's heating system. </description><start-date>1234854000000</start-date><display-name>Renewable energy projects are...</display-name><path>/2009/02/2740</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/02/2740</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338833938</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338833938</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/02/images/solar.electric.panels.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/02/images/solar.electric.panels.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>solar.electric.panels.250.jpg</name><file-size>40818</file-size><width>250</width><height>275</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Solar electric panels like these will be installed on the roof of the West Field House Gym. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/02/images/solar.thermal.panel.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/02/images/solar.thermal.panel.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>solar.thermal.panel.250.jpg</name><file-size>25378</file-size><width>250</width><height>208</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Solar thermal panels such as these will be placed on the roof of the OPERS building, below, and used in heating the campus pool. </image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/02/images/opers.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/02/images/opers.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>opers.250.jpg</name><file-size>18373</file-size><width>250</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC is getting even greener.</p>
<p>This year, the campus is embarking on two pilot green-power projects: installing solar panels on the West Field House Gym and increasing the efficiency of the campus pool's heating system.</p>
<p>These projects were initiated as a collaborative effort between faculty, staff, and students, according to Energy Manager Patrick Testoni.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, these demonstration projects will provide a solid foundation and precedent for additional projects at UCSC in the near future," Testoni said.</p>
<p>Testoni discovered third-party financing for solar panels through an arrangement known as a power purchase agreement (PPA). PPAs allow campuses to install solar at little or no cost to the campus. The campus leases the space to a vendor, who then installs the solar panels and sells the electricity back to the campus at a pre-determined rate.</p>
<p>"It's a good way to get projects done in these budget times," Testoni said.</p>
<p>Testoni identified several rooftops that would work for solar panels. He discussed the project with the co-chair of the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change, Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and department chair. The two agreed that installing solar panels would provide UCSC with an excellent and visible opportunity.</p>
<p>Since the concept of a PPA is new to the campus, they decided to pick one ideal site to serve as a pilot/demonstration project.</p>

<p>This project is a unique collaborative effort, said Testoni. The nature of the agreement has required participation between UCSC Purchasing, Physical Plant, Contracts, and Athletics Department staff. Faculty and students have been involved as well, and the result will be a solar array both visible to the public (since it's the home to the campus's athletics teams) and to students.</p>
<p>The project will have an educational component as well, since there will be a real-time display of energy generated by the array inside the building.</p>
<p>Testoni hopes this demonstration project at the West Field House will lead to the installation of solar panels on several campus buildings, as it will lay the foundation for using alternative business arrangements to move the campus toward its sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Also, this summer, Physical Plant will perform a thermal solar project at the East Field House Pool during the planned pool renovation. The energy-efficiency project to "green" the campus pool's heating system is one of the initial projects in the Strategic Energy Plan developed for the campuses by UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>Physical Plant will install solar thermal panels on the roof of the OPERS building at the East Field House. These panels will use the sun's power to generate heated water that will be used to heat the pool. In conjunction with the solar thermal project, Physical Plant will remove the cogeneration plant and the existing boilers at the East Field House, and replace them with small, modular, high-efficiency boilers. These boilers will provide the additional heating needed for the East Field above and beyond what the solar thermal panels can provide.</p>
<p>In a third demonstration project, Physical Plant is retrofitting the campus outdoor pole lighting as part of the UC Energy Efficiency Partnership with PG&amp;E. An initial demonstration project will be done at the Kerr Hall, Baskin Arts, and Bookstore Commons areas. This will involve replacing existing metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps with the latest in LED technology. The new LED fixtures use less than 50 percent of the energy than the existing fixtures and provide a higher quality of lighting.</p>

But, beginning this coming fall, the general subject "W" component of the requirement will be replaced by writing-based course in students' major.</p><p>The new Disciplinary Communication, or so-called "DC," requirement:</p><p>. Must be appropriate to student's major. (The former W requirement could be satisfied by passing any so-designated "W" course.)</p><p>. Must be an upper-division course. (The former W requirement could be met by passing an upper- or lower-division "W" course.)</p><p>. Can be satisfied by taking one to three separate courses totaling at least 5 credits.

The new designation is also intended to better serve students by providing expanded access to DC courses.</p><p>Padgett told members of the senate that the administration had already agreed to provide funding required to implement the expanded program. He said CEP and the administration believe the expanded offerings could cost $250,000 a year to implement. "Even though the budget is tough right now...let's stand up for education," Padgett said.</p><p>He said implementing the DC requirement would require:</p><p>. Reestablishment of strong peer tutoring program.</p><p>. Hiring of a faculty member dedicated to "writing in the disciplines."</p><p>. Resources to deploy Teaching Assistants where needed, and TA training</p><p>. Dedicated staff support.</p><p>Despite the campus's uncertain budget challenges, other faculty agreed that strengthening the writing skills of UCSC students was a goal worth reaching for. By a unanimous voice vote, senators in attendance supported the CEP proposal. So did students, represented at the Senate meeting by the Student Union Assembly, and the UCSC Alumni Association Council, which adopted a resolution supporting the writing-requirement changes.</p><p>Students who enrolled prior to this fall will be subject to the former writing requirements.

<p>I am looking forward to the discussion on the proposed Disciplinary Communications requirement - therefore my comments this afternoon will be brief to allow as much time as possible for that discussion.</p>
<p>Quentin has always said that it is the Chancellor's job to deliver the good news to the campus, and my job to deliver the bad news.</p>
<p>Since the Chancellor cannot be here today, I was prepared to deliver the good and the bad news - and yes, there is good news to report.</p>
<p>However, I was convinced that people want to know about the budget - so I will limit my comments to the budget and direct you to our Public Information website where the good news is reported on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As Quentin mentioned in the call for this meeting, it is hard to put a positive spin on the topic of our budget.</p>
<p>I am not going to attempt to do that.</p>
<p>This afternoon I want to tell you what I know, discuss what has been done to date, and then outline the steps we will take over the next few months to implement campus-wide budget reductions.</p>
<p><strong>What we know:</strong></p>
<p>The state has a projected $41-billion deficit through June 30, 2010.</p>
<p>As described in a recent news report, the state is almost out of cash. Bills are not getting paid. Tax refunds aren't being mailed. Construction work is stopped. Bonds can't be sold.</p>
<p>Because the State's fiscal condition continues to deteriorate, a special session of the Legislature was convened in December to develop an 18-month budget proposal - to address additional shortfalls in the current year and develop new proposals for the 09-10 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Gov. Schwarzenegger and four legislative leaders have agreed on a package of $15.1 billion in spending reductions, $14.4 billion in tax increases and $11.4 billion in borrowing - although as of this morning the legislature was still at a standoff and the budget had not passed.</p>
<p>The State Senate is in lockdown and lawmakers have brought sleeping bags to work.</p>
<p>In the current year, the University has already implemented a $33M mid-year reduction approved as part of the final budget last September.</p>
<p>President Yudof reported to the Regents yesterday that if the budget currently under consideration in the Special Session is adopted it would mean a $450 million state funding shortfall for the University.</p>
<p>This consists of $115M in new permanent cuts, $122 M in under funded enrollments, and an estimated $213M in mandatory cost increases over a two-year period for utilities, employee health benefits, faculty merit adjustments, and other inflationary costs.</p>

<p>He notes appropriately that our needs are much greater given the state funding trends over time - this $450M illustrates only the impact on the University since the most recent fiscal troubles began.</p>
<p>He also points to two ongoing, serious concerns: 1) that the continuing deterioration of the State's fiscal health causes us to speculate that additional reductions may be forthcoming, and 2) the elimination of funding for re-starting employer contributions to the retirement system puts the fiscal health of the system at risk.</p>
<p>It is difficult to anticipate exactly what the current financial crisis means for the University beyond two undisputed facts: 1) state support to the university will be reduced dramatically 2) our students and their families will be faced with significantly increased costs to attend UC.</p>
<p><strong>What has been done:</strong></p>
<p>UC leadership has been taking action over the last several months to address the current year crisis and is actively engaged in planning on how best to manage our response to the expected multi-year financial downturn.</p>
<p>To address budget cuts already enacted and in anticipation of further reductions, the Office of the President has implemented a number of actions.</p>
<p>These actions include:</p>
<p>. Cost efficiencies and staff downsizing at the UC Office of the President reduced its current operating budget by $60.4 million, a 21 percent savings over the prior year, along with an FTE reduction of 500, or 27 percent.</p>
<p>. UCOP has a goal of reducing its work force by at least another 275 positions and $25 million by the end of the 2009-10 fiscal year. This would result in a total work force reduction of 43 percent.</p>
<p>. A freeze has been implemented on the salaries of top administrators and compensation for a large group of senior leadership has been restricted significantly.</p>
<p>. Additional savings came from not filling vacant nonessential positions, curbing travel and consulting expenditures and consolidating and reorganizing departments in central administrative offices.</p>
<p>. Those efforts will continue along with ongoing reviews of programs and services that could be better delivered through third-party vendors or campuses.</p>
<p>Further, an effort has been launched by President Yudof to begin to consider the system's response to the longer-term impacts of this downturn.</p>
<p>I have been asked to serve on a Budget Advisory Committee, charged by President Yudof and co-chaired by Vice-President Katie Lapp and UCSB EVC Gene Lucas to consider system-wide actions to reduce our expenditures.</p>
<p>I have also been asked to serve on an advisory committee to consider actions that should be taken with our retirement system.</p>
<p>I will keep you apprised as the work of these committees progress.</p>
<p><strong>At UCSC:</strong></p>
<p>To address the current year reductions I asked that all principal officers implement a soft-hiring freeze and fill only essential positions.</p>
<p>I have asked that strict restrictions be placed on entertainment, travel and consulting expenses and that appropriate actions be taken to reduce expenses to the extent possible.</p>
<p>We are implementing a mid-year cut of approximately $6M in one time funds made necessary by additional reductions proposed by the governor that were not included in the final 2008-09 state budget.</p>
<p><u>For 2009-10, we are attempting to estimate what our share of the permanent reductions will be - not an easy task.</u></p>
<p><u>At this time, we are projecting that UCSC may need to implement permanent budget reductions that could be more than twice the magnitude of the mid-year cut.</u></p>
<p>Our projections take into account current information about state funding, expected increases in revenue (due to increases in mandatory system wide fees), and estimated cost of collective bargaining and other known mandatory increases, such as academic merits and utilities.</p>
<p>I am certain that, given the magnitude of the anticipated reductions, no area of the budget (including direct instruction and research) will be exempt from cuts.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty of an actual number, we will need to establish target reductions for each division on campus.</p>
<p>In December, I asked each Principal Officer to provide me with a brief summary of how s/he might manage a 10% budget reduction.</p>
<p>I convened a small group of colleagues to help me review the submittals - trying to understand the impact of proposed actions on our teaching and research activities.</p>
<p>I will soon put forward for Senate consultation a budget reduction proposal that will allocate proposed reductions by division.</p>
<p>This proposal will be reflective of the following</p>
<p>. Recognizing the magnitude of the cuts that must be realized in one year, I believe we must allocate cuts strategically in order to maintain the ability to resume progress in the future.</p>
<p>. In order to achieve this, we must establish a framework to guide the actions of the principal officers as they make operational decisions to achieve the necessary budgetary savings.</p>
<p>The framework I propose identifies the following as highest priorities (although efficiencies in all areas must continue to be sought):</p>
<p>. Services/activities that directly affect instruction and research;</p>
<p>. Required safety and compliance functions of the university;</p>
<p>. Activities that yield new revenue sources or increase revenue beyond the current levels.</p>
<p>There are three general guidelines that I will ask the Academic Deans to bear in mind as they decide how to implement budget reductions:</p>
<p>. Academic programs for which there is clear evidence of being highly ranked should be considered a higher priority than other academic programs;</p>
<p>. Maintaining or enhancing the quality of graduate student programs is more important than growth in graduate student numbers.</p>
<p>. Maintaining and/or enhancing the quality of instruction and research are critically important. However, the modes of delivering instruction and research should be reviewed to identify opportunities for reducing cost of delivery.</p>
<p>We too must think about the longer-term - how will we adjust to what could be further reductions.</p>
<p>To do this we must look at activities that span multiple academic or support units and evaluate whether further potential exists to realize short or long-term savings through re-organization increased efficiencies or cost avoidance.</p>
<p>I have convened a number of workgroups to propose ideas for further evaluation in the following areas:</p>
<p>. Administrative restructuring;</p>
<p>. Instruction;</p>
<p>. Instructional support;</p>
<p>. Undergraduate academic advising;</p>
<p>. Residential and Student Life programs;</p>
<p>. Academic personnel practices;</p>
<p>. Institutional support;</p>
<p>. Auxiliaries</p>
<p><strong>Going forward:</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the plane crash in the Hudson River, I read an article that discussed catastrophes - evaluating the characteristics and behaviors of those who survive in the face of catastrophe.</p>
<p>It reported that those who panic or are paralyzed by fear are least likely to survive.</p>
<p>Those who remain calm and figure out how to do what is necessary at the moment have a better rate of survival.</p>
<p>We are in a similar situation.</p>
<p>It is not life and death, but in order to get through this challenge and preserve our ability to progress (and I remind you that we have survived and progressed spectacularly despite previous budget reductions) we must do triage - cut more where the cuts are difficult but not disastrous, cut less where the cuts will do irreparable harm to the institution.</p>
<p>This will require support, involvement and sacrifice from faculty, staff, students and alumni.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on us, collectively, to ensure that UCSC remains positioned for future progress and competitive strength.</p>
<p>It is essential that we come together to make the necessary changes to sustain our excellence in education, research, scholarship, creative activity and public service.</p>
<p>We have much work ahead of us.</p>
<p>I will continue to rely on your continued input and counsel.</p>
<p>And in closing, I want to thank you for your patience, cooperation and commitment through these turbulent times.</p>

While my comments to the Senate obviously did not reflect this breakthrough, they provide a significant amount of detail that is as true today as it was yesterday. I encourage you to read <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2744">them</a>.</p><p>In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to more fully understand the impact this budget will have on UC Santa Cruz. One thing is certain: Our campus will face difficult choices in deciding how to accommodate a decline in state funding that we know will be very significant.</p><p>As I've reported earlier, mid-year cuts already allocated to our campus will impact many core academic, research, service, and support activities. Now that the state has an approved budget, we face the more difficult choices and decisions on how to implement the necessary permanent reductions in 2009-10. I believe that we will not be able to avoid some level of additional job loss. I want to assure each of you, however, that we are working to minimize this to the greatest extent possible through careful overall planning, a significant slow-down in filling vacant faculty and staff positions, and increasing efforts to reduce spending in all non-personnel areas.</p><p>Let me reaffirm that, fiscal challenges aside, we are all part of a dynamic teaching and research university. The planning process I described to faculty yesterday is intended to ensure that we address our short-term challenges but also continue to think about the long-term. We must continue to invest strategically in core academic and research functions and the talented people who support these activities.</p><p>Many of you have taken the time to provide me with thoughtful ideas about how the campus might best meet the challenges ahead. Please know that I appreciate not only your counsel, but your continued commitment to this campus.</p><p>Chancellor Blumenthal and I will continue to provide you with regular updates on these budget challenges.

After an intensive investigation, scientists determined that a massive "red tide" bloom of marine algae had produced a foamy soap-like substance that stripped the natural waterproofing from the birds' feathers.</p>
<p>This is the first documented case of its kind, but similar events may have gone undetected in the past, the researchers reported in a paper to be published in the online journal <em>PLoS ONE</em> on Monday, February 23.</p>
<p>"The problems we traditionally associate with harmful algal blooms are caused by toxins produced by the algae. In this case, it was a surfactant that removed the water-repellent properties of the feathers," said Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>Although this red tide bloom was nontoxic, it was very harmful to the affected birds, which included grebes, loons, northern fulmars, and surf scoters. Live birds found stranded on beaches around Monterey Bay were starving and severely hypothermic, having lost the insulation normally provided by their waterproof plumage. A total of 550 birds were stranded alive and 207 were found dead during this event.</p>
<p>Kudela teamed up with researchers from the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML)--all members of the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS)--to investigate the mass stranding, which occurred at the same time as the Cosco Busan oil spill in San Francisco Bay and an ongoing controversy over aerial spraying on the Central Coast to control the light brown apple moth.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of questions at the time about whether the stranding was related to those events, and we were able to eliminate those possibilities," Kudela said.</p>
<p>The dominant species in the red tide was a type of dinoflagellate known by the scientific name <em>Akashiwo sanguinea</em>, which has caused red tides in the past without harmful effects on wildlife. Kudela said the problems in 2007 resulted from the unusual combination of a large red tide late in the year, when large numbers of migrating birds had arrived in the area, plus big waves that churned up the water.</p>
<p>An algal protein produced the slimy foam that fouled the birds' feathers. Its effects were similar to those of soap and other surfactants that are used in detergents to dissolve grease. Wave action contributed to the problem by breaking up the cells of dying algae and churning the dissolved protein into the thick foam that was seen along the shoreline and floating on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>"We grew the algae in the lab, and when we shook it up it produced the same foam," Kudela said. "The waves act like a blender, churning up the cells and the protein."</p>
<p>These kinds of events may occur more often in the future, he said. The researchers noted that the frequency, size, and duration of red tides have increased substantially within Monterey Bay since 2004, and similar increases are occurring elsewhere in the world. These changes are probably due in part to the effects of climate change on surface water temperatures, Kudela said.</p>
<p>"Starting in 2004, we have had big red tides with greater frequency than in the past," he said. "Although 2007 was the first time we saw an impact on birds, the conditions are there for the same thing to happen the next time we have that combination of red tide, birds, and big storm waves."</p>
<p>The authors of the <em>PLoS ONE</em> paper include David Jessup and Melissa Miller at the CDFG Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center in Santa Cruz; John Ryan and Heather Kerkering at MBARI; Hannah Nevins at CDFG and MLML; Abdou Mekebri and David Crane at the CDFG Water Pollution Control Laboratory; and Kudela and Tyler Johnson at UCSC.</p>
<p>This research was partially funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal Blooms (MERHAB) program. MERHAB funds the California Program for Regional Enhanced Monitoring of Phycotoxins, which provided support for this research.</p>

This is in addition to writing-intensive core courses students are required to take as frosh and sophomores. </p><p>"Students understand that they need to write well in order to succeed, and potential employers are very clear on the importance of good writing," said linguistics professor Jaye Padgett, who shepherded the proposal as chair of the Academic Senate Committee on Educational Policy. The review of UCSC's general education requirements has been underway for two years. </p><p>The new upper-division writing requirement builds on two mandatory composition classes that students take during their first two years. It replaces another writing requirement that lacked the upper-division and discipline-based elements of the new initiative. To satisfy the new requirement, upper-division students must take one to three writing-intensive courses applicable to their major and totaling at least five credits.</p><p>From art history and biology to anthropology and engineering, each academic department will tailor courses to convey the reasoning and communication skills essential to success in specific disciplines. Although the new "disciplinary communication," or DC, requirement will focus mostly on writing, some courses will incorporate other forms of communication vital to specific disciplines, such as oral presentations or poster presentations, noted Padgett.</p><p>"Departments will ensure that students have courses unique to their field of study," said Padgett. "The faculty of each department will determine the writing needs of their majors."</p><p>At the Academic Senate meeting, undergraduate student leaders endorsed the proposal, saying an influx of upper-division writing courses will benefit all students. The UCSC Alumni Association Council at its winter meeting approved a resolution supporting the new disciplinary-writing requirement, heralding it as an important component of academic excellence and an expression of the campus's longstanding commitment to strong writing and communications instruction. </p><p>Support from alumni, foundations, and corporations will be sought to further enhance the comprehensive writing and general education program, said Donna Murphy, vice chancellor of University Relations. </p><p>"The outpouring of support for this initiative has been truly remarkable," said Murphy. "We are partnering with faculty to take writing instruction at UCSC to the highest level. This initiative will ensure that our graduates are among the best-prepared for the workforce and the opportunities of the 21st century."</p><p>The new graduation requirement takes effect this fall.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159d4718072704601a012ff346d894e"><name>2750</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Four arrested for threats and violence against UC researchers</title><summary>The FBI announced on February 20 that law-enforcement officers have arrested four people who are suspected of terrorizing University of California researchers.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><description>The FBI announced on February 20 that law-enforcement officers have arrested four people who are suspected of terrorizing University of California researchers.</description><start-date>1235113200000</start-date><display-name>Four arrested for threats...</display-name><path>/2009/02/2750</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/02/2750</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338837564</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338837564</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The FBI announced today that law-enforcement officers have arrested four people who are suspected of terrorizing University of California researchers.

<p>Society officials joined Chancellor Blumenthal and Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Bill Ladusaw in officially establishing the honor society at UCSC.</p>
<p>Blumenthal noted that UCSC is the seventh UC campus with a Golden Key chapter. "Our students deserve it and I know they will bring honor to this honor society," he said in brief remarks after being made an honorary founding member along with professors Raoul Birnbaum, Richard Hughey, Jaye Padgett, and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Dave Kliger.</p>
<p>Honor society members are recruited by invitation in their sophomore, junior, or senior year based on scholarship, if they are in the top 15 percent of their class. There is a $70 annual membership fee. As of the December 8 deadline, 182 UCSC students had joined.</p>
<p>The honor society, founded in 1977, now has chapters in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa. Last year, it gave out $500,000 in scholarships to its members, said Colleen Ware, Golden Key's associate director of university relations. Ten to 12 percent of applicants were successful in obtaining a scholarship of up to $10,000, she said.</p>
<p>Chapter officers at UCSC are Andrew Cichowski, president; Lonny Jones, vice president; and Elizabeth Locatelli, secretary.</p>

<p>"I feel like there's been more word spread around," said senior Chang, 21, looking out from his Green Campus Program table at the several hundred people milling about at the eighth annual campus Earth Summit, held Thursday in the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room.</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, the Earth Summit, organized by the Student Environmental Center, has created and advanced a dialogue among UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, administration, and the larger Santa Cruz community regarding the campus's local commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>The event was cosponsored by the campus <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu">Sustainability Office</a>, which was begun in 2007 as a two-year pilot program. Chancellor George Blumenthal has funded the office for three more years.</p>
<p>This year's event featured a roundtable discussion on collaborative sustainability efforts at UCSC and beyond moderated by Nikki Henderson of Oakland's Green for All, an organization that advocates for "green-collar" jobs and opportunities for the disadvantaged. The summit also included a poster session detailing campus sustainability progress; educational workshops led by members of the campus community; and topic groups creating shared visions and action steps to a sustainable campus.</p>
<p>"Our world is one of the most pressing--if not <em>the</em> most pressing--issues of our time," said Chancellor George Blumenthal in his remarks to the audience. "While we need to focus close to home, it is good to know we finally have an administration in Washington that--at least so far--takes sustainability and climate change seriously."</p>
<p>Since last year's summit, the Chancellor's Office has convened the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change; the campus changed its electricity purchasing, not only saving money but also creating a 44 percent reduction in greenhouse gases per megawatt hour used; Dining Services won a $5,000 grant for its comprehensive approach to food service sustainability; and vehicle traffic to and from campus is down to 1998 levels despite a 50 percent growth in enrollment.</p>
<p>Luna Miller, 21, a fourth-year art student in Kresge College, was volunteering at the event. She had attended last year's summit and thought it was a "cool gathering."</p>
<p>"It's just renewing and inspiring to be around lots of people you know, or don't know, who care about the same thing and come to get renewed inspiration," said Miller.</p>
<p>Tim Becker, 22, a fourth-year environmental studies major in College Nine, came to support friends who helped organize the event.</p>
<p>But also, he said, "as an environmental studies major, the organizations represented here are things I participate in and care about."</p>
<p>Organizations tabling and displaying informational posters at the summit included the Campus Sustainability Council, the Coastal Watershed Council, the Student Environmental Center, Round River Conservation Studies, Ecology Action, the Sierra Institute, and the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The summit also included a free, local, organic lunch for all attendees.</p>
<p>With the broad range of organizations represented at the event, many students hoped to meet people with similar interests and get a jumpstart on their futures.</p>
<p>"I hope to be able to network and have more of those human resources to be able to expand my own interests and get more involved," said Becker.</p>
<p>Shannon Scott, 19, a second-year environmental studies and psychology major in Cowell College, agreed.</p>
<p>"It might help me in my career and lead me to other interests," Scott said.</p>
<p>Alumnus Vlad Metrik, former co-chair of the Student Environmental Center, said this year's event is the best he's seen.</p>
<p>"There are more faculty, department heads, and students here than before," said Metrik, 27, who graduated in spring 2008 and now lives in Emeryville. Metrik was scheduled to facilitate a conversation on green purchasing during the topic discussion period of the day.</p>
<p>Organizers hope the event helps shape environmental policy on campus and widens the pool of people interested in environmental issues.</p>
<p>"The Earth Summit makes the Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus," said junior Sergio Costa, 19, referring to the compilation of visions generated at each summit that acts as a <a href="http://www.enviroslug.org/blueprint">guiding document</a>. Costa, an environmental studies and economics major in College Eight, now serves as co-chair of the Student Environmental Center.</p>
<p>"I hope this year's summit will create good notes for that blueprint," Costa said. "And I hope people get really excited about the environment."</p>

How do neurons develop to create the complex wiring of the brain? Can we build a better microscope to study living cells?</p>
<p>These are among the questions UCSC stem cell researchers are investigating with funding from the <a href="http://www.cirm.ca.gov">California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</a> (CIRM). Their work could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, heart disease, neurological and muscular disorders, and many other conditions.</p>
<p>The UCSC Stem Cell Symposium--held on Wednesday, February 25, in the Science &amp; Engineering Library--showcased a variety of stem cell research projects now under way on campus. It was also an opportunity to celebrate the opening last year of UCSC's Shared Stem Cell Facility, a state-of-the-art laboratory built with CIRM funding.</p>
<p>"We are really pleased to be a part of the basic research effort that goes into developing stem cell technology and, ultimately, its medical applications," said David Haussler, director of UCSC's stem cell training program and professor of biomolecular engineering in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, also directs UCSC's interdisciplinary <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a>, which manages the campus's CIRM grants. With the addition of a $2.2 million training grant approved earlier this month, CIRM funding awarded to UCSC now totals $19.4 million.</p>
<p>"We believe Santa Cruz is one of the key parts of our whole operation," said CIRM president Alan Trounson, who emphasized the importance of partnerships between stem cell scientists at UCSC and clinical researchers working to develop new stem cell-based therapies to treat conditions such as diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease.</p>
<p>"There is good reason to make those connections with clinicians, because your basic science is critical to where they're going," he said.</p>
<p>One way in which stem cells may be used to treat diseases is through cell transplants to replace tissue that is damaged by disease or injury. Embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into any type of cell in the body. But researchers must learn how to guide the development of stem cells in the lab to produce just the cell type needed for a particular therapy.</p>
<p>"Stem cells may provide an unlimited resource for therapy if we can learn to guide the differentiation of cultured stem cells in the petri dish," said Bin Chen, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology.</p>
<p>Chen described work in her lab to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control the development of neural stem cells into different types of neurons in the brain. Understanding these mechanisms is a key step in learning how to grow specific types of neurons in the lab for use in cell therapy, she said.</p>
<p>Stem cell research also holds promise for developing new cancer therapies. Camilla Forsberg, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, described her research on the complex pathways by which the many different types of blood cells are produced from blood stem cells in the bone marrow. Errors in the regulation of these pathways lead to diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, caused by over-proliferation of certain blood cells. Forsberg's lab is studying one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>"If we could identify the cancer stem cell, then we could use very targeted treatments instead of bombarding it with nonspecific drugs that also affect healthy cells," she said.</p>
<p>Forsberg said her research has benefited greatly from collaborations with computational biologists led by Joshua Stuart, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School.</p>
<p>Haussler also emphasized the value of computational tools developed at UCSC, including the <a href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, for addressing the challenges of stem cell research. "There are opportunities here for us to provide the genomic database for clinical trials coming out of CIRM research," he said.</p>
<p>Another presentation that highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of UCSC stem cell research described efforts to build a better microscope for stem cell biologists, using technology astronomers have developed to sharpen the images from telescopes.</p>
<p>"Imaging is incredibly important for stem cell research," said William Sullivan, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology. "The problem is that we don't have single-cell resolution for deep tissue imaging."</p>
<p>Adaptive optics technology is used in astronomy to correct for the blurring effect of the Earth's atmosphere, which distorts the images from ground-based telescopes. Sullivan is working with Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School, and astronomy researchers at UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics to develop an adaptive optics microscope for imaging deep within tissues containing stem cells.</p>
<p>The symposium also featured lab tours and poster presentations of research by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom are in the stem cell training program. The UCSC Training Program in Systems Biology of Stem Cells provides students and postdoctoral researchers with a solid understanding of the biology of stem cells, the skills to use stem cells in their own research, and the ability to devise and use computational approaches in their stem cell research.</p>
<p>The symposium was sponsored by the UCSC <a href="http://stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/index">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</a>, the <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a>, the <a href="http://qb3.org">California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences</a>, the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, and the <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Division of Physical and Biological Sciences</a>.</p>
