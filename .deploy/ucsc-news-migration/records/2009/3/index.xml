Photo by Callie Shell/Aurora for Time.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The week before the Nov. 4 election, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/"><em>Time</em></a> magazine Washington correspondent Michael Scherer (B.A. Oakes, 1998) wrote a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,1853246,00.html">cover story</a> about voter disenfranchisement that opened with these words:</p>
<p><em>We can go to the moon, split atoms to power submarines, squeeze profits from a 99 cent hamburger and watch football highlights on cell phones. But the most successful democracy in human history has yet to figure out how to conduct a proper election.</em></p>
<p>True to his roots as a creative writing major at UCSC, Scherer strives for vivid language as compelling as the facts unearthed by his vigorous reporting.</p>
<p>"Personally, the thing I still get the greatest joy out of is that one good sentence," said Scherer, now <em>Time</em>'s White House correspondent. "I still aspire to writing the kind of magazine piece you read and show friends, telling them, 'You have to read this'--where you learn more than the subject matter; you learn something about the world."</p>
<p>Scherer, who covered John McCain during the presidential campaign, says he is regularly impressed by the pomp surrounding the presidency. "I've been spending a lot of time on <em>Air Force One</em> lately, and you know, I never really thought I'd be flying around on <em>Air Force One</em>," he said. "They have napkins that say 'Aboard the presidential aircraft.' Every now and then I look around and ask myself, 'What are you doing?' I'm having a great time. It's a pinch-yourself job."</p>
<p>Five weeks into <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a>'s presidency, Scherer shared a few observations of the popular president. "He's as good as any politician I've seen at doing politics--working the room, delivering a speech, appearing to be human and sincere," he said. "On the most basic level, he's incredibly talented. But it's too early to tell how it's going to play out."</p>
<p>"One thing I can say is the 'super-cool thing' is very real," he said. "He can handle an enormous amount of pressure and numerous tasks in a very even, almost detached way. He's very different from McCain, who was more fly-by-the-seat-of-his pants. McCain liked the dog fight. Obama is more reflective. He seems very aware of what he's doing as he does it."</p>
<p>That said, Scherer is mindful of history and what he called the "crucial flaw" that has plagued every modern American president. "I'm not sure what Obama's is, but I'm pretty convinced he's not going to be flawless," he said.</p>
<p>Scherer, like fellow UCSC alumna <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2516">Dana Priest</a> who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for reporting at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, has a knack for investigative reporting. After graduating, he did a two-year stint at a daily newspaper in western Massachusetts, then moved to <em>Mother Jones</em>, where he contributed to the muckraking magazine's exposÃ© of campaign financing that ran just before the 2000 presidential election. He earned a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and covered Washington D.C. for Salon.com before joining <em>Time</em> in December 2007. He covered Republican candidates Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, and McCain before landing the coveted White House beat on January 3.</p>
<p>Between regular posts on Time.com's political blog "<a href="http://swampland.blogs.time.com/&quot;">Swampland</a>" and writing for the magazine, the job is pretty unrelenting. Scherer, who had only five days off during his first eight weeks in the White House, jokes that Obama gets more time to work out in the gym than he does. "It's a very different kind of life here," conceded Scherer, 33, a native of San Francisco. "I mean, I'm a California boy. People here work all the time. But I still have a life."</p>
<p>Although he covers the president and has been in the Oval Office--"I remember being very impressed by a large bowl of apples on the coffee table--it's still there. I've seen it in pictures"--Scherer isn't yet on a first-name basis with Obama. "I've been introduced, and I got to shake his hand, but I covered McCain during the campaign," he said. "I haven't interviewed him yet."</p>
<p>Scherer likens the mechanics of covering the president to the task of covering the mayor of a small town, but he admits to a case of nerves during Obama's first open press conference as president. "When I had to write about it afterward, I realized I hadn't paid that much attention to what he was saying because I was so worried about what question I was going to ask if he called on me," recalled Scherer, adding: "I didn't get called on."</p>
<p>And Scherer is still getting used to the fact that his workday often unfolds on live national television. "The cable networks cover the White House press briefings live, but you forget eight to 10 cameras are on you," he said. "My parents called to tell me a friend had called them to say (White House spokesman Robert) Gibbs called me 'Mike.' That very much impressed my parents."</p>
<p>Scherer describes the White House press corps as "this sort of chaotic collision of reporters," and rebuffs a query about whether journalists are overly eager to find fault with the popular new president. "My job is asking questions," said Scherer. "My job isn't to be his friend, and it's not to be unfair. My job is to be a skeptic and hungry for information."</p>
<p>Scherer's artful presentation of that information is a talent he honed at UCSC. "I always read a lot, and I always liked words. The creative writing kind of snuck up on me," he recalled. "That's when I realized I really loved writing and was willing to spend my life trying to get good at it. That hasn't gone away. It has only gotten stronger."</p>
<p>Shortly after graduation, Scherer discovered literary narrative writing and devoured the works of authors A. J. Liebling, Gay Talese, H. L. Mencken, and others. Lately, he sustains himself with modern American poetry, in part because he has so little free time. Occasionally, he is derided for his literary roots: "I was on the bus with McCain in Iowa in early 2007, and I referred to the French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard in my story. At least one blogger came after me for that," Scherer said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Although Scherer said he didn't come to Washington to cover the White House, he is clearly in his element. A big fan of the television drama <em>The West Wing</em>--"I still believe the second season of <em>West Wing</em> is the best season ever in the history of television"--Scherer was drawn to what he called the "white-collar fantasy" that underlies the show.</p>
<p>"The premise of West Wing is that you can work incredibly hard at something that matters, and that it's not just about making money, and that it can be fulfilling," he said. "I've always wanted a job like that, and I guess I've got it now."</p>

"Using software I designed, I averaged together a selection of these images." </p><p>"Averaging is an algorithmic process that merges a series of images into one--creating a final image that is a composite of all those submitted to the software," he added. </p><p>Anderson noted that another influence on this work is the aesthetic of the sky taken from Hudson River School paintings. The Hudson River School was a loosely affiliated group of 19th-century painters who lived and worked in the Hudson River Valley in upstate New York. </p><p>"These artists were the first to truly represent the American Landscape," said Anderson. "The vocabulary of their work included luminous and at times ominous skies through which they sought to evoke an emotional response to an idealized American wilderness." </p><p>Anderson received his B.A. in art from the Conceptual Design program at San Francisco State University, as well as an M.A. in interdisciplinary studies, focusing on technology art practice and 20th-century continental philosophy. </p><p>He is a member of the faculty for UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) graduate program. </p><p>Gallery 16 is located at 501 Third Street at Bryant in San Francisco.

<p>The book's 19 essays serve as a tribute to a revered and respected literary and cultural critic, whose vast body of work led to his election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.</p>
<p>An internationally recognized scholar and founding faculty member of UC Santa Cruz, Berger is known for a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary approach that goes far beyond traditional academic boundaries.</p>
<p>Berger studied literature and art history at Yale University, where he earned his B.A. and Ph.D. in English and taught for 12 years. He came to UC Santa Cruz in 1965 where he taught a variety of subjects under the general category of culture theory and Renaissance culture, including Renaissance drama and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In art history, he specialized in Italian and Dutch painting and the theory and practice of portraiture.</p>
<p>Berger has published extensively over the years, with numerous books and more than 100 articles to his credit. As he noted in a 2002 interview: "Sometimes I have a sense of myself as sitting at a typing table and floating on a cloud for 50 years."</p>
<p>Although he retired in the 1990s, Berger continues to teach classes as an emeritus professor at UCSC, as well as lead seminars for faculty and students at such venues as the Newberry Library and the Shakespeare Society of America.</p>
<p>Berger's most recent books include <em>Manhood, Marriage, and Mischief: Rembrandt's 'Night Watch' and Other Dutch Group Portraits</em> (2006) and <em>Situated Utterances: Texts, Bodies and Cultural Representations</em> (2005).</p>
<p>Still a prolific author, Berger noted that he is currently preparing three separate books that have been accepted for publication by Fordham Press on Shakespeare, Plato, and Edmund Spenser, and has several more in the works.</p>

Don't toss that paper in the trash. The campus is depending on you.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has entered the annual recycling contest <a href="http://www.recyclemaniacs.org">Recyclemania</a> for the second time, and organizers are hoping they can improve the campus's ranking compared with last year.</p>
<p>"I hope we'll post better numbers this year," said Recycling Coordinator Dave Wade. "We've seen a big increase in public awareness and interest over the last year."</p>
<p>In signing up to compete, UCSC joins 510 colleges and universities worldwide, up from approximately 400 nationwide last year. The friendly, 10-week competition among college and university recycling programs aims to increase awareness and participation in campus recycling and waste-reduction efforts. Schools representing all 50 states and several other countries are participating.</p>
<p>During the competition, campuses go head-to-head in different contests to see which institution can collect the largest amount of recyclables per capita, the largest amount of total recyclables, the least amount of solid waste per capita, or other benchmarks.</p>
<p>UCSC's participation generated a lot of additional interest in recycling on campus, Wade said.</p>
<p>"I fielded lots of phone calls and e-mails specifically because someone had heard or read about Recyclemania," he said.</p>
<p>Since it was the first year the campus participated, he's not sure whether recycling quantitatively increased because of the contest, "but awareness certainly increased," he said.</p>
<p>He hopes people on campus will help the Recycling division to recycle even more this year.</p>
<p>"We've added new recycling locations, added a new truck and a new driver, all so that we can divert more materials," said Wade. "But we need people in the community to take that first step and choose to recycle. We can't do it ourselves. It takes community participation."</p>
<p>There's more to recycling than just keeping stuff out of landfills, as important as that is, said Wade.</p>
<p>"Recycling is about saving energy and natural resources, and reducing pollution," Wade said. "It's also part of the larger picture when it comes to reducing waste and thereby reducing our environmental impacts, decreasing our carbon footprint, and fighting global warming."</p>
<p>From now through the end of March, UCSC will compete with the other universities enrolled in Reyclemania to see who can recycle the most and throw away the least amount of materials.</p>
<p>Wade is asking the campus community for help.</p>
<p>"Make the choice to reduce needless waste, choose re-useable goods wherever you can, and recycle as much as you can," he said. "Your efforts really do matter."</p>
<p>RecycleMania began in 2001 when Ed Newman of Ohio University and Stacy Edmonds Wheeler of Miami University decided that something had to be done to increase recycling in the residence and dining halls on their campuses. The first year, Miami University won the competition over Ohio University.</p>
<p>Since then, the program grew rapidly in participants each year and expanded to include various contests. In 2007, the number of contestants more than doubled over the previous year, with 201 schools battling for RecycleMania glory. That year, the effort produced 41.3 million total pounds of recycled materials, up from approximately 18 million pounds in 2006.</p>
<p>Last year, Reyclemaniacs recycled a total of 58.6 million pounds.</p>
<p>Results are reported weekly on Fridays on the RecycleMania web site.</p>

"'We're taking an intellectual stand and giving our students the skills necessary for today's world."</p><p>Building on the UCSC's longstanding commitment to undergraduate education, the Academic Senate endorsed revisions to the  general-education curriculum--the core coursework required of all students. The new requirements emphasize interdisciplinary themes that create opportunities for students to consider and analyze complex issues from multiple perspectives. </p><p>The new general-education requirements have been tailored to prepare students for the pressures and opportunities of contemporary life. New requirements include statistical reasoning courses that will give students the tools to thrive in today's media-saturated information society, and a course on cross-cultural analysis that will inform and prepare students for work and life in the "global village."</p><p>The new curriculum emphasizes engagement with the world, concern about social justice and inequity, and a willingness to try to solve society's problems. "We're trying to make links to social issues," said Padgett. "We want these requirements to be part of the reason students choose to come to UC Santa Cruz."</p><p>Padgett is chair of the Senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), which led the multi-year process to overhaul the campus' undergraduate curriculum for the first time in 25 years. The revisions were approved Friday, March 6, at a special meeting of the Academic Senate. The new curriculum responds to young peoples' desire for a fresh approach to the challenges of today's fast-paced world and will prepare UCSC students to be well-rounded global citizens, said Padgett. </p><p>"We consulted with faculty, and what we heard is that they wanted to infuse the general-education requirements with new energy," said Padgett, who said he remembers feeling like a "cog in the big state university" during his own undergraduate years. "So often, general education ends up being uninspiring. We would like to do better than that."</p><p>The reforms mark a departure from what Padgett called a "cafeteria approach" to general education requirements, which mandate that students complete a certain number of courses within broad subject areas. Instead, the new approach asks students to take courses in more specific areas, providing "a more focused, intellectually defined approach to general education," said Padgett.</p><p>The requirements, which will take effect in the fall of 2010, include completion of one course each in:</p><p>. cross-cultural analysis </p><p>. ethnicity and race </p><p>. interpreting arts and media</p><p>. mathematical and formal reasoning</p><p>. scientific inquiry</p><p>. statistical reasoning </p><p>. textual analysis and interpretation</p><p>In addition, undergraduates will choose one of three perspectives courses focused on environmental awareness, human behavior, or technology and society; as well as one two-credit course on either creative process, collaborative endeavor, or service learning. The changes build on enhanced <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2749">writing requirements</a> that were approved by faculty on Feb. 18.</p><p>Already committed to the principle of interdisciplinary undergraduate education, UCSC was well-positioned to take this fresh, more topical approach to general education, said Padgett.</p><p>"A class in environmental awareness could include an engineering component to address the entrepreneurial aspects of tackling problems such as climate change," said Padgett. "We'll take a broad view of what it means to be socially engaged."</p><p>Simultaneously, the campus is embarking on a new initiative to build interdisciplinary topical clusters, or "ITCs," that will further enrich learning opportunities for undergraduates. College Eight will launch the first such cluster this fall with its sustainability-themed cluster, "Nurturing Environmental Citizenship."</p><p>Padgett sees the interdisciplinary clusters as an opportunity for departments to introduce students to fields they might not have explored, and to reinforce the value of those academic pursuits. "The first two years of study are so often taken up with getting major prerequisites done that students sometimes lose sight of why what they're studying is important to the world," he said.</p><p>The general education reforms set the stage for the ITCs, which build on the UCSC tradition of academic learning within the setting of the campus' ten residential colleges, noted Padgett. "There's a natural synergy with the colleges," he said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159f4298072704601a012ff99f07a55"><name>2772</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revised Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) update</title><summary>FMLA update</summary><keywords>FMLA</keywords><description>FMLA update</description><start-date>1236322800000</start-date><display-name>Revised Family and Medical...</display-name><path>/2009/03/2772</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/03/2772</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338845660</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338845660</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This is to announce that the United States Department of Labor has released final revised regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).</p><p> </p><p>These regulations became effective on January 16, 2009.

But new findings show that some sources of dust also carry toxic elements that can kill marine phytoplankton.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered the toxic effects during a study of how phytoplankton respond to atmospheric aerosols deposited in the northern Red Sea. The results will be published in the online early edition of the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> the week of March 9, 2009.</p>
<p>"This is the first time that toxicity from atmospheric aerosols has been reported for the ocean system," said first author Adina Paytan, an associate researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Oceanographers have always thought of dust deposition as good for phytoplankton, because it provides nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. But we know air pollution has negative effects on the terrestrial side, and we need to think about the effects of pollutants that may be deposited in the oceans," she said.</p>
<p>Paytan and her coworkers collected aerosols on filters, incubated the samples with seawater, and observed the responses of phytoplankton. They found that the results depended on the wind direction. Aerosols collected from air masses originating over Europe stimulated phytoplankton growth, whereas aerosols from air originating over Africa, which carried dust from the Sahara Desert, had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Aerosols from both sources supplied key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, but the Sahara sources also contained high concentrations of copper. "When we added the Sahara dust, the phytoplankton died within 24 hours," Paytan said. "We found that copper was really high in those samples, so we suspected that copper was causing the toxicity."</p>
<p>In follow-up studies, the researchers tested the effects of different concentrations of copper on a dominant species of phytoplankton in the seawater. The organisms (a type of cyanobacterium called <em>Synechococcus</em>) died at the same copper concentrations found in the aerosols. Other studies compared different species of phytoplankton and found variations in their sensitivity to copper.</p>
<p>"The populations of some organisms crashed, while others breezed right through it. So the effects of copper deposition could change the balance in the ecosystem, allowing less sensitive species to take over," Paytan said.</p>
<p>To investigate the global implications of atmospheric copper deposition, the researchers gathered data from various sources on copper concentrations in aerosols, global distributions of aerosols, and aerosol deposition rates. Using an atmospheric deposition model, they calculated rates of copper deposition in different areas of the oceans. They also estimated the contribution of manmade sources of copper compared to pre-industrial rates of copper deposition.</p>
<p>Their analysis suggests that manmade sources account for about 40 percent of the copper deposited in the oceans from atmospheric aerosols. Although most of the copper deposition comes from natural sources of dust, the manmade sources are likely to increase over time, Paytan said. In addition, she said, there may be other pollutants in atmospheric aerosols that could also have toxic effects on marine phytoplankton.</p>
<p>The modeling study suggested that certain areas--such as the Bay of Bengal and downwind of South and East Asia--are particularly at risk for the effects of copper deposition on ocean ecosystems.</p>
<p>The study has several implications for climate change researchers, Paytan said. The amount of dust blowing off the land may change as a result of changes in terrestrial ecosystems. The effects of the dust on phytoplankton growth can be positive or negative, depending on the balance of nutrients and toxins. And as marine phytoplankton grow and photosynthesize, they draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing the atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of questions to follow up on," said Paytan, who has received funding from the National Science Foundation to conduct follow-up studies.</p>
<p>In addition to Paytan, the coauthors of the <em>PNAS</em> paper are Katherine Mackey and Ying Chen of UCSC; Ivan Lima and Scott Doney of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Natalie Mahowald of Cornell University; Rochelle Labiosa of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park; and Anton Post of the Interuniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.</p>
<p>This research was supported in part by grants from NASA, NATO, and the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>UCSC and Foothill-De Anza have formed a nonprofit entity called University Associates - Silicon Valley LLC, which signed a lease with NASA in December for 75 acres of land in the NASA Research Park.</p>
<p>The goal of the partnership is to create a prototype for an environmentally sustainable community and contribute to the economic vitality of the region, while providing a unique collaborative environment in which to deliver innovative education and research, said UCSC chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"Our vision is to seed innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainability through the creative reuse of an important public asset for regional benefit. We aim to establish world-class programs and facilities dedicated to preparing the workforce of the future and to conducting research at the forefront of science and technology," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>"Today's announcement marks the launch of an exciting new collaboration that brings together some of the world's leading educators and scientists to create a world-class community for future research and development," said S. Pete Worden, director of NASA Ames Research Center. "NASA is proud to be associated with this dynamic venture and looks forward to seeing the vision become a reality."</p>
<p>Martha Kanter, chancellor of Foothill-De Anza, said, "Being part of this unique education and research community would give Foothill-De Anza students new opportunities to learn in a world-class research environment. It opens up exciting possibilities for preparing our students to enter Silicon Valley's clean-tech green-tech workforce or pursue advanced study in science, technology, engineering, and emerging career fields."</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University, Santa Clara University, and San Jose State University have also been involved in the planning and may eventually join the partnership, said Joseph Miller, UCSC's vice provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives.</p>
<p>"We expect other academic institutions, including representatives of the California State University system, will join the partnership to take advantage of this unique opportunity," Miller said. "We have secured a long-term lease agreement on a choice location in the heart of Silicon Valley, adjacent to NASA Ames and the most innovative companies in the world. We will be creating a new green community and working together to tackle some of the most pressing problems facing our society."</p>
<p>This vision includes an integrated community featuring state-of-the-art research and teaching laboratories, shared classrooms, housing, accommodations for industrial partners, and modern infrastructure. Joint academic initiatives are planned in science, engineering, and management to keep Silicon Valley at the forefront of innovation and technology leadership.</p>
<p>The community will be designed to have a minimal carbon footprint and will serve as a model site to deploy and validate new renewable-energy and resource-conservation systems. As a real-world setting for studying and testing potential solutions, it will provide an invaluable resource for faculty engaged in sustainability research and teaching programs at UCSC and other partner institutions.</p>
<p>For students, the collaboration will offer joint academic programs that draw upon the talents and expertise of each partner institution. "Being part of the University Associates presents new opportunities for our district to create accelerated programs of study with our partner universities," Kanter said.</p>
<p>The project supports the missions of NASA. NASA's goal is to establish the NASA Research Park (NRP) as a shared-use R&amp;D and education campus for collaborations among government, industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations. More than 50 industry, university and nonprofit organizations are already located in the NRP, supporting NASA's mission in three areas: advancing NASA's research leadership; facilitating science and technology education; and creating a unique community of researchers, students and educators. Students attending the new campus will provide a source of future employees to strengthen NASA's workforce and help the agency achieve its exploration objectives.</p>
<p>UCSC has led the planning for this innovative collaboration, which builds on the campus's highly successful existing partnerships with NASA Ames, such as the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and the Advanced Studies Laboratories (ASL).</p>
<p>Local congressmembers--including U.S. Representatives Anna Eshoo, Mike Honda, Zoe Lofgren and others--provided valuable support for the lease agreement with NASA, Miller said. "We are extremely grateful for the strong support from local leaders, which was vitally important to our success in moving this forward," he said.</p>
<p>The next critical step for the partnership is to undertake thorough evaluation and planning studies in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), said William Berry, newly named president of University Associates. University Associates is engaged in ongoing efforts to obtain community input and to determine how best to ensure that any development addresses community needs and is effectively integrated into the surrounding cities.</p>
<p>Development of the site would be undertaken through a public-private partnership. University Associates plans to select and oversee a "master developer," who would attract the external capital investment required to complete the project, which is expected to cost more than $1 billion. The property will remain in federal ownership, with University Associates and the master developer responsible for managing and developing the site.</p>
<p>The timeline for the development depends on multiple factors, including CEQA compliance, the financial climate, market demands, and potential partnerships with industry. Work on the site could begin as early as 2013, with initial occupancy as early as 2015.</p>

She's been into the game, she said, "pretty much my whole life."</p>
<p>That passion and persistence has paid off. Lamb has received a 2008-09 <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?ContentID=573">NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship</a>.</p>
<p>The scholarships--one-time grants of $7,500--are awarded each sports season to 58 student-athletes who excel academically and athletically and who are in their final year of intercollegiate athletics competition. In Lamb's sports season (fall), 372 student-athletes applied for the scholarships.</p>
<p>Despite already having earned three prestigious All-American titles, four All West Region titles, and numerous other awards, Lamb didn't expect to win the Postgraduate Scholarship.</p>
<p>"I was surprised," said the modest Stevenson College senior, 21, who's majoring in biology. "It seemed out of reach."</p>
<p>Lamb is the first UCSC student-athlete to receive this recognition, according to Gene Switkes, professor of chemistry and faculty athletic representative. She is the only University of California student-athlete--and the only one from a California university--among the fall 2008-09 female awardees.</p>
<p>Lamb, who is originally from Santa Barbara, has "put a lot of work in both sides, as a soccer player and academically," said Michael Runeare, head coach of the women's soccer team.</p>
<p>She was captain of the team this past year, and works in the research laboratory of Professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Alan Zahler. Last year, she participated in the Education Abroad Program in environmental biology in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Lamb's scholarship is well deserved, said Runeare.</p>
<p>"She's a phenomenal athlete," he said. "She's tall and slender, and very coordinated. For soccer, often it's the smaller players who have the quick feet. She encompasses both--very good quickness, very athletic, great speed in the open field, very technical."</p>
<p>Lamb's greatest asset is her ability to score goals, Runeare said. She's set UCSC scoring records for career goals--59--and for career points--129.</p>
<p>But for Lamb, who plays forward, it's not just about winning, he said.</p>
<p>"I appreciate her drive and her focus, but I also appreciate that she still keeps things light," Runeare said. "She's got a great attitude, and she's not pretentious at all. Despite all these accomplishments, she's never been showy. And against opponents, she's never boisterous--it's not about her, but about the team."</p>
<p>It's that affinity for the team that has kept Lamb going all these years.</p>
<p>"I like having a team," she said. "It's like a family, almost. You really get to know them well. It's a really good bond to have with people."</p>
<p>That's why she felt strange accepting the previous awards she's won.</p>
<p>"It's a team sport," Lamb said. "I'm not very good at defense--my specialty is scoring goals. I think forwards always get more recognition. It takes away from the team, almost. I would rather get team awards."</p>
<p>But she was excited about winning the NCAA Postgraduate scholarship, since it was something she actively applied for rather than an award she received just by playing, she said.</p>
<p>She'd like to study physical therapy and sports training in graduate school, and she has her eye on a three-year program split between San Francisco State University and UC San Francisco.</p>
<p>But for now, she's focusing on classes and work, aiming to graduate next fall.</p>
<p>"I hope she stays involved with soccer," said Coach Runeare. "I hope she finds happiness and keeps pursuing her goals, and stays connected to the university, which I think she will."</p>
<p>A second UCSC student-athlete, men's soccer player Bobby Petro, was selected as an alternate in the men's 2008-09 NCAA Postgraduate scholarship competition.</p>

<p><em>Chancellor, UC Santa Cruz</em></p>
<p><em>University Associates - NASA Ames Partnership</em></p>
<p><em>NASA Ames Research Center</em></p>
<p><em>March 13, 2009</em></p>

<p>Thank you, Carl [Carl Guardino, President and CEO, Silicon Valley Leadership Group]</p>
<p>On behalf of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and our many partners, thank you for joining us this afternoon as we celebrate a Defining Moment for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Today we celebrate the formation of a partnership between University Associates and NASA Ames, a unique 21st century collaboration.</p>
<p>A collaboration that will deliver enormous impact in the Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is honored to be a major part of this partnership.</p>
<p>Today, you will hear from the key individuals whose vision, energy, dedication, and plain old hard work have made this partnership possible.</p>
<p>Without them none of us would be here today.</p>
<p>Let me acknowledge and thank several individuals and institutions for their support.</p>
<p>First, our dedicated Congressional representatives who have supported UCSC's growing presence here in the valley, and who have traveled from Washington today to join us in celebrating this partnership.</p>
<p>The Honorable Anna Eshoo.</p>
<p>The Honorable Mike Honda.</p>
<p>The Honorable Zoe Lofgren.</p>
<p>This partnership and its promise for the future is possible because of the vision, collaboration, and effectiveness of our colleagues at NASA, and our partner and potential partner educational institutions.</p>
<p>Pete Worden, director of the NASA Ames Research Center, whose vision for this partnership cannot be underestimated, has been a key player in this partnership.</p>
<p>Martha Kanter, one of the real leaders of this collaboration. She is president of Foothill-De Anza Community College District - a key education partner and the first educational institution to join us as a formal partner.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Father Michael Engh, president of Santa Clara University, and Jared Cohon, president of Carnegie Mellon University - representing two institutions closely involved early on and whom we hope will become official partners very soon.</p>
<p>I am delighted also to be joined by Dean Pam Stacks, representing President Jon Whitmore of San Jose State University.</p>
<p>And Dan Dooley, who's representing the UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>So, why are we calling this a Defining Moment?</p>
<p>First of all, because we are launching a partnership that will harness and leverage the ideas and drive of all the partners to create an innovative, sustainable community for education, research, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Secondly, because we are contributing to revitalizing and enhancing an important public asset for the 21st century.</p>
<p>And third, because we envision a vibrant, sustainable community of students, teachers, researchers, and valley partners who will contribute to the economic vitality of the region.</p>
<p>What can we accomplish together?</p>
<p>Let's have a look; we have a short video presentation.</p>

<p>What do I mean by delivering the future</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley has long been a global center of innovation. Now it is becoming the epicenter of the green revolution.</p>
<p>Our University Associates partnership will provide a dynamic, nurturing environment for green innovation.</p>
<p>Researchers, working together, will expedite development of emerging green technologies.</p>
<p>We will create knowledge, apply it to real-world challenges, and equip students to deliver results in the valley's burgeoning green-tech sector.</p>
<p>Who is going to benefit from all this?</p>
<p>First of all, students at all levels of higher education - community colleges, CSUs and UCs - who will find unique opportunities to learn from experts, participate in world-class research and become the workforce and innovators of the future while crossing the traditional boundaries of higher education.</p>
<p>Second, researchers, who will be located in a state-of-the-art environment that fosters collaboration with valley entrepreneurs on solving problems and bringing big ideas to market.</p>
<p>And the rest of us, we'll also benefit. Society at large, as the partners focus on innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example that addresses one of the great challenges facing us: energy.</p>
<p>We will collaborate across disciplines to address future energy needs and cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>One R&amp;D lab is already in place. UC Santa Cruz's Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute is launching projects in renewable energy - solar, and the conversion of waste-heat to electricity.</p>
<p>I want to thank Congressman Mike Honda for his support for our Bio-Info-Nano effort.</p>
<p>These new laboratories depend not just upon the strategic partnership between NASA, UC Santa Cruz, and Foothill-De Anza Community College District, and our other educational partners, but also on relationships with other academic institutions and corporations.</p>
<p>And on the continued support from leaders in national, state, regional, and local government.</p>
<p>With nearly 800 employees in the valley, UCSC's teaching and research programs already serve more than 18,000 students from pre-kindergarten to the executive level. UC Santa Cruz is committed to our exciting partnership in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And we are committed to being the UC for Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"I wrote a dozen Lithgowpalooza Readers, including <i>It Stinks to be Extinct!</i>" </p><p>Now living happily with her husband and daughter in Portland, Oregon, Blackaby was recently in the SF Bay Area visiting schools to promote her latest book, <i>Cleopatra: Egypt's Last and Greatest Queen</i>. </p><p>Just issued by Sterling Publishing, <i>Cleopatra</i> is part of a biography series for young adults that focuses on important women in world history. </p><p>"I kept trying to write it like a novel to keep the pulse of the story," says Blackaby.</p><p>After graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 1975 with a degree in Western Civilization,  Blackaby's career as a writer took off after a chance encounter at one of her first jobs.</p><p>"I was just a lowly Xerox girl at Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in Menlo Park," Blackaby explains. "One day, I noticed one of the lessons was supposed to be in Latin roots, but all of the words were in Greek. Someone asked me how I knew that, and I told them I had majored in ancient Greece at UC Santa Cruz. So I was immediately promoted to their editorial team-they gave me my own office and a little red pencil, and I never looked back!"</p><p>Blackaby notes that her time as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz has had a profoundly positive effect on her life and career.</p><p>"I think UCSC professors prided themselves on teaching us to think," she observes. "It turns out thinking really pays off.and most people don't do it." </p><p>"UCSC just becomes a part of your DNA," Blackaby adds. "It's something that you maybe don't realize until you come back to the campus. It still feels like home-even if you're only here for an afternoon after 10 years. It's a great place."</p><p>Blackaby has recently been writing articles for the National Geographic Society's children's magazine, <i>Explorer</i>. She currently has two books in the pipeline that will be published next year; one is a collection of poetry for kids about animal habitats. </p><p>But she continues to also look for projects to help non-readers-projects such as her series of books about inline skating, surfing, and extreme sports that only contained words with one syllable. "I wrote a whole book about surfing, but couldn't use the word 'ocean'."</p><p>"Those books are for kids who have lost hope," Blackaby says. "Our daughter was a non-reader. And it was so frustrating to try and find her stuff to get a toehold. So it's great to help those kids."</p><p></p><p>					</p><p>  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a09de8072704601a012ff1370340d"><name>2788</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Richards, Cabrera, Rickford win Alumni Association top honors </title><summary>The common thread running through the Alumni Association's top award winners for 2008-09 is their exceptional ability to inspire.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Alumni Association, Alan Richards, Rosie Cabrera, John Rickford</keywords><description>The common thread running through the Alumni Association's top award winners for 2008-09 is their exceptional ability to inspire.</description><start-date>1237359600000</start-date><display-name>Richards, Cabrera, Rickford win...</display-name><path>/2009/03/2788</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/03/2788</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338851238</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338851238</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/03/images/richards.alan.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/03/images/richards.alan.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>richards.alan.250.jpg</name><file-size>25016</file-size><width>250</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Alan Richards </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/03/images/cabrera.rosie.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/03/images/cabrera.rosie.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cabrera.rosie.250.jpg</name><file-size>40964</file-size><width>250</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Rosie Cabrera (photos by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/03/images/rickford.john.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/03/images/rickford.john.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rickford.john.250.jpg</name><file-size>23869</file-size><width>250</width><height>316</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>John Rickford (photo by Phil Carter)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The common thread running through the Alumni Association's top award winners for 2008-09 is their exceptional ability to inspire.</p>
<p>The award winners are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinguished Teaching Award: Alan Richards, professor, environmental studies<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Outstanding Staff Award: Rosalee ("Rosie") Cabrera, director, El Centro Chicano Latino Student Resource Center<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Alumni Achievement Award: John Rickford (Stevenson '71, B.A. linguistics), professor of linguistics, Stanford University</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The Alumni Association will present Cabrera and Richards with their awards at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 25, 2009, immediately preceding the All-Alumni Reunion Picnic. The picnic is a new Reunion event that will bring hundreds of alumni together to see friends and enjoy alumni wine, beer, and al fresco cuisine. The award presentation will take place in the Humanities Lecture Hall; the picnic will be held close by in the Stevenson College Courtyard. Both are featured events of UCSC's <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions">Reunion Weekend</a>, April 24-26.</p>
<p>Rickford will be honored on Founders Day, October 23, 2009.</p>
<p>Alan Richards has had a distinguished 32-year teaching career, first in the Economics Department and more recently in Environmental Studies. His class, <em>Blood and Oil: Energy, the Middle East, and War,</em> is legendary on campus. His experience living in the Middle East and working at the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Agency for International Development informs his teaching, as does his interdisciplinary approach to scholarship. He is known for fast-paced, beautifully structured, powerfully delivered lectures sprinkled with moments of brilliant humor.</p>
<p>"The readings he assigned were superb and still occupy important places on my shelves," said an alumnus who now teaches at Cornell University.</p>
<p>A student in the <em>Blood and Oil</em> class said, "Some classes are difficult to sit through, but in his, it's 'tell me more.'"</p>
<p>Cabrera is the director of El Centro, UCSC's Chicano Latino Student Resource Center. She has worked at UCSC for 24 years in a variety of positions, including as a counselor in the Educational Opportunity Program. She has inspired many generations of students.</p>
<p>"I can think of no one on campus more committed to helping our students reach their full potential as young scholars, leaders, and human beings," said her supervisor, Executive Director of Student and Academic Support Services Larry Trujillo, in his nomination.</p>
<p>One of her many student admirers said that Cabrera "has created an atmosphere of home and protection at El Centro."</p>
<p>Rickford is professor of linguistics and Pritzker University Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford University. Through his scholarly work in sociolinguistics, Rickford has enhanced understanding of the connections between language, ethnicity, and social class. He received recognition during the Oakland Ebonics controversy of 1996-97, which erupted when the Oakland School Board voted to take into account African American vernacular language ("Ebonics") in their language arts lessons.</p>
<p>Rickford has been a dedicated mentor to students; among his former students are a member of the U.S. Congress (Barbara Lee, D-Oakland) and faculty at the nation's top linguistics programs.</p>
<p>Interested members of the campus community and the public are welcome to attend the award presentation and/or picnic. Picnic tickets are $18 each for Alumni Association members and $20 for nonmembers.</p>

<p>The hollow gold nanospheres developed in the laboratory of Jin Zhang, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, have a unique set of properties, including strong, narrow, and tunable absorption of light. Zhang is collaborating with researchers at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, who have used the new nanostructures to target tumors for photothermal cancer therapy. They reported good results from preclinical studies earlier this year (<em>Clinical Cancer Research,</em> February 1, 2009).</p>
<p>Zhang described his lab's work on the hollow gold nanospheres in a talk on Sunday, March 22, at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>"What makes this structure special is the combination of the spherical shape, the small size, and the strong absorption in visible and near infrared light," Zhang said. "The absorption is not only strong, it is also narrow and tunable. All of these properties are important for cancer treatment."</p>
<p>Zhang's lab is able to control the synthesis of the hollow gold nanospheres to produce particles with consistent size and optical properties. The hollow particles can be made in sizes ranging from 20 to 70 nanometers in diameter, which is an ideal range for biological applications that require particles to be incorporated into living cells. The optical properties can be tuned by varying the particle size and wall thickness.</p>
<p>In the cancer studies, led by Chun Li of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, researchers attached a short peptide to the nanospheres that enabled the particles to bind to tumor cells. After injecting the nanospheres into mice with melanoma, the researchers irradiated the animals' tumors with near-infrared light from a laser, heating the gold nanospheres and selectively killing the cancer cells to which the particles were bound.</p>
<p>Cancer therapy was not the goal, however, when Zhang's lab began working several years ago on the synthesis and characterization of hollow gold nanospheres. Zhang has studied a wide range of metal nanostructures to optimize their properties for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SERS is a powerful optical technique that can be used for sensitive detection of biological molecules and other applications.</p>
<p>Adam Schwartzberg, then a graduate student in Zhang's lab at UCSC, initially set out to reproduce work reported by Chinese researchers in 2005. In the process, he perfected the synthesis of the hollow gold nanospheres, then demonstrated and characterized their SERS activity.</p>
<p>"This process is able to produce SERS-active nanoparticles that are significantly smaller than traditional nanoparticle structures used for SERS, providing a sensor element that can be more easily incorporated into cells for localized intracellular measurements," Schwartzberg, now at UC Berkeley, reported in a 2006 paper published in <em>Analytical Chemistry.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration with Li began when Zhang heard him speak at a conference about using solid nanoparticles for photothermal cancer therapy. Zhang immediately saw the advantages of the hollow gold nanospheres for this technique. Li uses near-infrared light in the procedure because it provides good tissue penetration. But the solid gold nanoparticles he was using do not absorb near-infrared light efficiently. Zhang suggested that he could synthesize hollow gold nanospheres that absorb light most efficiently at precisely the wavelength (800 nanometers) emitted by Li's near-infrared laser.</p>
<p>"The heat that kills the cancer cells depends on light absorption by the metal nanoparticles, so more efficient absorption of the light is better," Zhang said. "The hollow gold nanospheres were 50 times more effective than solid gold nanoparticles for light absorption in the near-infrared."</p>
<p>Zhang's group has been exploring other nanostructures that can be synthesized using the same techniques. For example, graduate student Tammy Olson has designed hollow double-nanoshell structures of gold and silver, which show enhanced SERS activities compared to the hollow gold nanospheres.</p>
<p>The ability to tune the optical properties of the hollow nanospheres makes them highly versatile, Zhang said. "It is a unique structure that offers true advantages over other nanostructures, so it has a lot of potential," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a0e338072704601a012ff4be7f036"><name>2791</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; interviewed economist Rob Fairlie about business ownership rates during the past three recessions.</summary><description>The &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; interviewed economist Rob Fairlie about business ownership rates during the past three recessions.</description><start-date>1237791600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/03/2791</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/03/2791</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338852357</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338852357</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Economist Rob Fairlie has been in the media spotlight lately, fielding calls from top national publications.

<p>You might look no further than a new compact handbook co-authored by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of film and digital media Gustavo Vazquez with John Hewitt, San Francisco State professor emeritus of broadcast and electronic communication arts.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Documentary Filmmaking: A Contemporary Field Guide</em>, the book is a straightforward, hands-on workbook that follows the documentary production path all the way from idea to distribution.</p>
<p>Although there are numerous books about documentary filmmaking already out there on the market, Vazquez is confident that his book will stand out.</p>
<p>"The current crop of books doesn't explore the process the way we do," said Vazquez. "The others try to accomplish too much-adding historical or theoretical chapters. Ours is street smart."</p>
<p>Designed for both seasoned practitioners and students, the book offers sound advice on everything from the crucial role of story construction, to the importance of staying on top of emerging distribution methods.</p>
<p>As the authors note in the introduction:</p>
<p>"Whether you are a penniless, guerilla documentary hopeful wanting to distribute on Internet video and mobile phone screens, a student expecting to make it to Sundance, or a recognized documentary producer with an exclusive PBS contract for the next 16 years, we hope you find this book useful and revealing."</p>
<p><em>Documentary Filmmaking: A Contemporary Field Guide</em> is designed to alert potential filmmakers to the most successful methods-as well as the pitfalls-of each stage in making a documentary film. It arose out of the two authors' combined 60 years of independent documentary work and 40 years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>Vazquez, who specializes in video production as a professor at UC Santa Cruz, has been making independent films for the past three decades. His most recent documentary, <em>Que viva La Lucha</em>, explores social class and border culture through the world of Mexican masked wrestling. It had its premiere in 2007 at the Mill Valley Film Festival.</p>
<p>Vazquez's other films include <em>El Zocalo</em> (co-produced with UCSC film professor and Ant Farm collective founder Chip Lord); <em>Corazon de Seda</em> (Heart of Silk), a biographical documentary on the composer Agustin Lara; <em>Comedy of the Underground</em>, a portrait of San Francisco experimental filmmaker George Kuchar; and <em>The Great Mojado Invasion</em>-which Vazquez described as "a classic Chicano sci-fi cult film that continues to be politically relevant to the global anti-immigrant hysteria."</p>
<p>Hewitt has spent the past four decades working as an independent documentary producer, cinematographer, and editor. His works include <em>Landmines of the Heart</em>, a look at political reconciliation in Cambodia; <em>Smokestack Lightnin': The Music of Howlin' Wolf</em>; <em>A Passion for Horses</em>, <em>Staying Lost and Found in Bahia</em>; and <em>The Summer of the Amigos</em>.</p>
<p>Hewitt was also director of photography for <em>America's Chemical Angels</em> (2007), which explored drug therapy for children with ADHD. He specialized in documentary production, broadcast journalism, and international broadcast systems as a professor at San Francisco State University.</p>

<p>The free panel discussion will take place from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 25, in the UCSC Humanities Lecture Hall, following an evening keynote address about "Our Environmental Destiny" the night before by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>Kennedy's appearance at UCSC's second annual Intellectual Forum will kick off Reunion Weekend 2009 festivities.</p>
<p>Saturday's follow-up panel discussion will feature Strader, a graduate of the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, and well-known NPR science reporter Harris, who earned a B.A. in biology from UCSC in 1980, as well as Press, chair of the Environmental Studies Department, who specializes in environmental politics and policy. Admission is free, but <a href="http://www.ucsc.onlinecommunity.com/cgi-any/activities.dll/show?bid=&amp;id=108&amp;template=event_reg_register.htm%20to%20register">advance registration</a> is requested.</p>
<p>Strader, the director of the Troy Community Farm in Madison, Wisconsin, was the top vote-getter during an online poll that was part of the ongoing grassroots movement to establish a <a href="http://whitehousefarmer.com/">"White House Farmer"</a>. Last week, First Lady Michelle Obama broke ground for an organic vegetable garden on the South Lawn, which will be tended by members of the White House grounds crew and kitchen staff.</p>
<p>Strader, one of 111 nominated farmers, brings more than 15 years of successful small-scale agriculture experience to her work as farmer and educator at Troy Community Farm in Madison, Wisc. During her eight years at Troy, Strader has turned a five-acre parcel of weedy, urban landscape into a highly productive, organic vegetable farm providing food for 115 Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members, farmers' markets, and several local grocery stores. She also supports the "grow local" movement through community gardens, childrens' gardening programs, internships, and restoration projects. Strader lives in Madison, where she and her partner keep a small urban apiary and tend a budding backyard orchard.</p>
<p>Harris is an award-winning journalist who joined NPR in 1986. As a science correspondent, he has traveled throughout the world to report on stories. A California native, Harris was valedictorian of his Crown College graduating class at UCSC in 1980. After college, Harris went straight into journalism, working as a newspaper reporter before joining NPR. He has earned numerous awards for his reporting and was elected an honorary member of the scientific research society Sigma Xi in 2002.</p>
<p>Press is a policy expert whose research focuses on the role of participatory politics in environmental management and protection. He is interested in resource conservation issues, as well as the policy questions that arise around industrial pollution and resource consumption. He is the author of <em>Saving Open Space: The Politics of Local Preservation in California</em>. In 2007, Press was named the inaugural holder of the Olga T. Griswold Chair in Environmental Studies. In addition to his campus responsibilities, Press has served on the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees water quality protection in California.</p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The young sea otter was found washed up on the beach in late February, her thick, insulating fur covered with tar balls and slick oil. She had had an encounter with crude oil--likely a natural seep--somewhere off the Monterey coast. Without help, she could die.</p>
<p>Instantly, volunteers with the <a href="http://www.mmpp.ucsc.edu/Marine_Mammal_Physiology_Project/Home.html">Marine Mammal Physiology Project</a> (MMPP) at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory sprang into action and were ready when the otter arrived from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where she had been stabilized.</p>
<p>Terrie Williams, professor of biology and director of the MMPP, and her two paid staff members--Traci Kendall and Beau Richter--were gone on research trips when the otter was found, leaving the volunteers to devise a rehabilitation plan for the distressed animal mostly on their own.</p>
<p>But Monika Rohrer, 26, a UCSC alumna and one of the lead volunteers in Olive's recovery, didn't panic.</p>
<p>"I thought, 'OK, I need to get this in order,'" said Rohrer (biology, '04). Rohrer has volunteered 20 hours a week with Williams's project since 2005; she also works part-time as an aviculturist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>When otters get oiled, their the fur becomes saturated with water.</p>
<p>"It's like a tear in a wetsuit--water infiltrates the fur," said Williams, who directed the Valdez Sea Otter Rescue Center during the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup. "They don't have blubber. Without the protection of their fur, they'll go hypothermic."</p>
<p>The otter, who is about a year old, was cleaned with detergent and olive oil--hence her nickname, Olive--and placed in a small pool to allow her saturated fur time to return to normal water repellency, a process that took weeks.</p>
<p>There are usually 15-25 volunteers at the MMPP; at the moment, there are 15, said Kendall.</p>
<p>They're the lifeblood of the operation, she said. "Our program absolutely would not run without volunteers."</p>
<p>Rohrer, fellow UCSC alumna Christina Doll (marine biology, minor in education, '06), and other volunteers provided 24-hour care for Olive for the first four days. They slept in a loft at the Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, near Long Marine Lab, where Olive is being kept alongside other, permanently housed sea otters.</p>
<p>The otters who live at the Fish and Game facility were once stranded and released, but unsuccessful in the wild. Now, they participate in research projects such as measuring how much energy sea otters--considered a threatened species--use to dive and catch food.</p>
<p>Olive's first few days were touch and go.</p>
<p>"I think I slept two hours the first night, and maybe three hours the next few nights," said Rohrer.</p>
<p>Olive required hourly seafood feedings to stoke the internal metabolic fires that keep her body warm. Hour after hour, in the dark, through rain storms, morning frosts, and bone-chilling coastal winds, Rohrer, Doll, and student volunteers from Williams's marine lab thawed and chopped seafood to feed Olive. They constantly monitored her recovery, counting every calorie she ate, celebrating every ounce of body weight she added.</p>
<p>"I knew they had the capability to do it--it was just a question of if they had the time, with their other commitments," Kendall said of the volunteers. "They made the time."</p>
<p>Many of the project's volunteers are UCSC students, and they give their time to constructive work with animals for years, said Williams.</p>
<p>"There's a level of dedication that is rare," she said. "It's astounding given everyone is trying to find jobs and survive, living in high-priced Santa Cruz. But these kids come in there without question and without fail--they recognize that without them, these animals can't eat."</p>
<p>In a case such as Olive's, "you've got an animal in an emergency situation, and they responded like paramedics," Williams said. "There was no question about what they were going to do. You can't help but be proud."</p>
<p>The first week of Olive's stay, volunteers put 348 hours of work into her rehabilitation. For the past three weeks, volunteers have given about 60 hours a week to her recovery.</p>
<p>Olive is now ready to be released, pending good conditions.</p>
<p>"She should do very well," said Kendall. "Her coat is back to normal, and we've been feeding her live food items, so she shouldn't have forgotten how to forage. I'm guardedly optimistic."</p>
<p>For Rohrer, it will be an amazing moment to see Olive return to her ocean home after the effort she put into nursing her back to health.</p>
<p>"It was pretty chaotic, but it was amazing," said Rohrer. "It was the best experience. I would never trade it."</p>

His book, <i>Morals and Markets</i>, showcases the interplay of markets and morals.</p><p>"Credible insurance and swift bankruptcy proceedings are far superior to a web of legal prohibitions," emphasized Friedman.</p><p>The internal dynamics of the financial system guarantee that conservative bankers will be passed by in favor of those who employ aggressive tactics that make more money, said Friedman. "It's a systemic issue," he added. "Bernard Madoff is just a bad guy. He didn't create the problem."</p><p>Failures of the political and regulatory systems allowed excesses to go unchecked, according to Friedman.</p><p>"Regulators set the rules of the game, and you want rules that steer ambition toward productive activities," said Friedman. "What we've seen on Wall Street in the last few years was ambition steered toward destructive risk-taking. Those who tried to behave more honorably were sidelined."</p><p>It was the job of regulators, and Congress, to ask whether the system was creating an undue amount of risk, said Friedman. Since the mid-1990s, an ideologically driven "hands off" attitude toward regulation allowed the system to get dangerously out of balance.</p><p>"It's not that Wall Street bankers were greedier than their predecessors--there's never been a shortage of greed out there," said Friedman. "Market imperatives undermined any moral restraint that might have come from regulators."</p><p>Complicated by "layers of plausible deniability" that insulated decision makers from the consequences of their actions, the system failed because of a lack of accountability, according to Friedman: "Why did rating agencies give AAA ratings to garbage? Because everybody was making money, and everybody thought it was someone else's problem."</p><p>Reinvigorating the role of morality in the market system is overdue, but even that is complicated, notes Friedman, citing the "conflicting moral calls" regarding the U.S. auto industry. "Some say we have to help the auto workers, while others say it would be immoral for the government to get involved in bailing out these companies," he said. "It's a delicate balance." Bailing out U.S. auto companies could create "feeble financial giants that roam the earth for years," added Friedman, who favors a form of bankruptcy-type proceedings that would allow investors to move forward with confidence.</p><p>The interplay of morals and markets is like a troubled marriage, according to Friedman. "There's friction, and sometimes the players work at cross-purposes," he said. "But I'm optimistic that this marriage can be saved."</p><p>With its sweeping scope, <i>Morals and Markets</i> traces the evolution of markets and presents global examples of the interaction of morals and markets. </p><p>"What's good for the individual isn't always what's good for the group, and vice versa," said Friedman. "Too much morality can be destructive, as in Japan, where social deference inhibited the recognition of failure and has had devastating economic consequences since 1990. Unable to come to terms with poor-performing banks in the early 1990s when Japan's economic bubble burst, state regulators propped up ailing banks and created "zombie companies" that dragged down the Japanese economy for more than a decade. By contrast, Russia in the 1990s "was the sort of place that gives anarchy a bad name," writes Friedman, who attributes the former superpower's economic crash to an inadequate moral infrastructure that fueled the black market and Russia's "transition to kleptocracy."</p><p>An ambitious yet accessibly written book that draws from multiple disciplines, <i>Morals and Markets</i> identifies morality as the trait that sets humans apart from all other species. Friedman's research spanned the fields of anthropology, biology, history, and psychology, as well as economics.</p><p>"A moral system is the shared understanding of what's proper, and the evolution of our moral system is concurrent with the origins of humanity," said Friedman. "What makes us human is a moral system. It's what lets us succeed. Our minds are really attuned to it, so that when there's a screw-up, we want to know who broke the rules."</p><p>Just as he resists the temptation to scapegoat actors in the current crisis, Friedman takes a holistic approach in the book, which he cautioned might frustrate some readers. "There are things to annoy ideologues of every political stripe," he said.</p><p>The scope of the book made it "a lot of fun to put together," said Friedman. " I've wanted to write this book for 10 years. I've always been an interdisciplinary kind of person, and UCSC was a wonderful place to do this."</p><p></p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Dan Friedman may be reached at dan@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-4981.

<p>The browser consists of a suite of web-based tools designed to help researchers find patterns in the huge amounts of clinical and genomic data being gathered in large-scale cancer studies. Medical researchers hope to identify genetic signatures and other "biomarkers" in cancer cells that can be used to predict how individual patients will respond to different therapies throughout the course of their treatment.</p>
<p>A paper describing the Cancer Genomics Browser has been published in the April issue of <em>Nature Methods</em> by a team based at the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UCSC. Coauthor David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, said development of the browser was driven by the needs of cancer researchers, who are now using powerful technologies for genome analysis and DNA sequencing in their efforts to understand cancer at the molecular level.</p>
<p>"Each of these tests gives millions of measurements, and the result is a bad case of data overload," Haussler said. "We've built the cancer browser so that researchers can upload their data and use a variety of software tools to visualize and interpret their results."</p>
<p>To get a user's perspective on the browser as it took shape, Haussler's team worked closely with Dr. Laura Esserman, professor of surgery and radiology at UC San Francisco, and Marc Lenburg, associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. Esserman and Lenburg, both coauthors of the paper, are involved in the I-SPY Trial, a multi-institutional collaboration aimed at identifying biomarkers to predict the most effective therapies for patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>
<p>"What is amazing about the browser is that it allows us to combine complex molecular data and clinical observations, and provides insights into how we can truly improve treatment and outcomes," said Esserman, director of the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center and associate director of the Breast Oncology Program at the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCSF.</p>
<p>Cancer genomics involves searching for all of the genes and mutations that contribute to the development of a cancer cell and its progression from a localized cancer to metastatic disease that spreads throughout the body. A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, and researchers are now able to analyze the alterations that occur throughout the genome of a patient's cancer cells. Recent advances, such as microarray technology and high-throughput DNA sequencing, have made it possible to characterize tumor samples in exquisite detail.</p>
<p>"You can run a microarray chip that analyzes a million points in the genome and can tell you about changes in the DNA, as well as inherited variations that make a person more or less susceptible to cancer," Haussler said.</p>
<p>Many different types of genomic changes can have clinical significance, including insertions, deletions, and other changes in the DNA sequence, such as changes in the number of copies of a gene. Moreover, microarrays and high-throughput methods for measuring proteins make it possible to see how these genomic alterations interfere with the cell's normal workings.</p>
<p>"The Cancer Genomics Browser is fantastic in that it helps users display many different dimensions of clinical and molecular data simultaneously," Lenburg said. "For example, for a given set of tumor biopsies, it is possible to see which regions of the genome are abnormal, how much of every gene is being expressed, how active various signaling pathways are--all organized by, say, how well each patient responded to a particular drug. As a result, the process of identifying possible connections is really easy."</p>
<p>The browser was developed by a team of scientists at UCSC's <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a> (CBSE), an interdisciplinary center housed in the Baskin School of Engineering and directed by Haussler. Ting Wang, a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow, came up with the initial design of the browser and coordinated the team's efforts. The first three authors of the paper--postdoctoral researcher Jingchun Zhu and graduate students Zachary Sanborn and Stephen Benz--did much of the work involved in building the browser, with help from CBSE research scientist James Kent and others.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu">public browser site</a> hosts a growing body of publicly available cancer genomic data, and the browser is also being used on confidential, prepublication data by several groups involved in clinical trials and cancer genomics research, Wang said.</p>
<p>The Cancer Genomics Browser is a natural extension of the UCSC Genome Browser, a widely used platform for accessing and visualizing genomic data. Created by Kent as a tool for exploring the human genome, the UCSC Genome Browser now averages one million page requests every week. It displays data and annotations in linear tracks that parallel the DNA sequences of the dozens of genomes in the browser.</p>
<p>But this type of display doesn't work well with clinical data from large numbers of patients. And clinical databases don't handle genomic data very well. The Cancer Genomics Browser is able to integrate these different types of data into a single interactive display.</p>
<p>"Large clinical trials that include detailed molecular profiling of patient samples generate a really big mountain of data. Actually, it is more like several big mountains of data," Lenburg said. "The browser creates a way of organizing all this data, and all these different types of data, into a single unified picture."</p>
<p>The Cancer Genomics Browser represents data as "heatmaps," in which colors represent the values of key variables. Genomic and clinical data are displayed side by side, and researchers can group and sort the data on the basis of any feature of interest, such as age, gender, response to therapy, estrogen-receptor status of breast cancers, and so on. Because humans excel at visual pattern recognition, correlations in the data tend to jump out as the user manipulates the browser display.</p>
<p>"The ideas behind it are simple, but the result is a pretty powerful tool. It makes it a lot easier to see patterns in the data," Wang said.</p>
<p>Standard statistical tools are integrated into the browser so that users can perform quantitative analyses. The browser's developers hope to improve these capabilities in the future. "Now that we have the platform, we want to incorporate state-of-the-art algorithms to get the most out of the data," Wang said.</p>
<p>In developing the browser, the researchers used prepublication datasets from the I-SPY Trial (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The I-SPY study is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and includes nine cancer centers nationwide. TCGA is a large-scale collaborative effort by NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute to systematically characterize the genomic changes that occur in cancer. The UCSC team is also working with a related worldwide effort, the International Cancer Genome Consortium.</p>
<p>The coauthors of the <em>Nature Methods</em> paper include UCSC researchers Christopher Szeto, Fan Hsu, Robert Kuhn, Donna Karolchik, and John Archie, in addition to Zhu, Sanborn, Benz, Lenburg, Esserman, Kent, Haussler, and Wang. Funding for this project was provided by the I-SPY consortium, the TCGA consortium, the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), and the National Institutes of Health. Haussler is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a2d7f8072704601a012ffee44dc41"><name>2805</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring quarter recreation registration begins April 7</title><start-date>1238396400000</start-date><display-name>Spring quarter recreation registration...</display-name><path>/2009/03/2805</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/03/2805</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338860330</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338860330</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC Recreation registration begins April 7th @ 9:00 am online at <a href="www.ucscrecreation.com">www.ucscrecreation.com</a></p>

Photo by Don Kenny.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>College Eight is at the forefront of a campuswide effort to revitalize the college core courses, and Provost Ravi Rajan has his eye on creating an "outstanding freshman experience."</p><p>Beginning this fall, College Eight's expanded core course will give students a chance to really engage with the theme of "environment and society," said Rajan, a professor of environmental studies and the inspiration behind the changes.</p><p>"I'm looking for gravitas," said Rajan. "I want to build up the theme and build up the sense of community and the synergy that's possible at the colleges."</p><p>During fall quarter, all 400 or so College Eight freshmen will enroll in a 5-unit writing course, as well as a 3-unit seminar, taught by Rajan, called "The Environment and Us." Most strikingly, the new core course will be interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on faculty from electrical engineering, Earth and planetary sciences, and ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as environmental studies.</p><p>The College Eight core course is the first example of a college-based "interdisciplinary topical cluster," or ITC, which is an element of a campuswide effort to enhance undergraduate education. The initiative includes new <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2771">general-education graduation requirements</a> and a new <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2749">disciplinary communication requirement</a> that will help give students upper-division writing instruction tailored to their field of study.</p><p>"Our goal is to create a first-quarter experience that combines the best of an upper-division course and the enhanced support of a writing-based core course," said Rajan. "They will be serious, intense courses that are also exciting topically, so they will be a better introduction to what the rest of college will be like."</p><p>The core course will give students "a solid scientific and policy foundation for environmental citizenship," said Rajan, who is eager to foster what he calls an "entrepreneurial spirit" that will empower students to help tackle and solve environmental problems.</p><p>After fall quarter, up to 200 students will have the option of enrolling in winter-and spring-quarter classes. In January, "Principles of Environmental Science" will be taught by Ingrid Parker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Patrick Chuang, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences. In spring quarter, the focus will be "Technological Innovation and Environmental Challenges," co-taught by Ali Shakouri, professor of electrical engineering, and Kent Pedrotti, associate professor of electrical engineering.</p><p>For Parker, who is an alum of College Eight, teaching the winter-quarter course is a way to honor the environmental themes of her alma mater and to reach out to freshmen. "Environmental problems are among the biggest problems we face as human beings on this planet. It will be nice to get back to teaching in a more applied, conservation arena," said Parker, whose research focuses on invasive plant species.</p><p>"It's important to catch people at that stage of their academic development, when they're figuring out what's important to them and what they're interested in," added Parker. "It's an opportunity to influence the way they think about problems and to expand their horizons a bit. I'm excited to be involved."</p><p>Designing the course and developing the syllabus with Paul Koch, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has provided an opportunity for genuine collaboration across disciplines, said Parker, who brings an evolutionary and ecological perspective to the geological and biogeochemical perspective Koch brings. Students will benefit as College Eight pioneers an approach that is taking hold across the campus, said Rajan.</p><p>"This truly interdisciplinary approach will integrate science, technology, and humanistic and policy approaches to the environment," said Rajan. "Students will satisfy a lot of their general-education requirements."</p><p>The campuswide efforts build on UCSC's tradition of offering an outstanding undergraduate education, said linguistics professor Jaye Padgett, chair of the Academic Senate committee that updated the general-education requirements. Provosts of several other colleges are following College Eight's lead and developing interdisciplinary clusters, said Padgett, who believes the approach will bring more coherence and excitement to general education and that the college is the ideal setting for such an undertaking.</p><p>Parker, too, believes the college setting offers unique benefits. "There's something really wonderful about the shared experience that happens in the colleges, where students are together 24/7 and have the opportunity to discuss what they're reading over breakfast or a midnight snack," she said. "That shared intellectual and life experience, particularly at their age, is very exciting."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a333b8072704601a012ff96406bc3"><name>2809</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Leadership for Silicon Valley initiatives</title><start-date>1238482800000</start-date><display-name>Leadership for Silicon Valley...</display-name><path>/2009/03/2809</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/03/2809</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338861789</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338861789</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In November of 2007, I had the pleasure of appointing Professor Joseph Miller to the position of Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives.
