<p>Here is a partial list of those activities:</p>
<p><strong>Student Health Center:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ordered seasonal influenza vaccine for students and scheduled clinics.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Notified all health center students with medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes that the seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for them and to schedule an appointment to receive the vaccine.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Ordered H1N1 influenza vaccine for students.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Increased urgent care and same day appointment capacity to improve access to care.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Developed mechanism to quantify how many students are evaluated through the student health clinic with a diagnosis of influenza like illness<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Initiated telephone triage phone advice line for students with influenza like illness.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Developed and provided educational programs to staff and administrators across campus regarding preparing the campus for H1N1.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Posted signs at health center entrance, asking all students with respiratory infection symptoms to wear a mask to decrease the spread of infection; made masks available.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Supplied hand sanitizers throughout health center for students and staff to decrease the spread of infection.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Worked closely with the Santa Cruz Public Health Department on preparing for and preventing H1N1 infection on campus.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Housing and Residential Programs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Staff have identified several on-campus rooms that could be used to isolate an ill student from a well roommate or if well students want temporary housing while their roommate recovers from the flu.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Publicity has been made available in all on-campus residential communities regarding hand washing techniques and personal hygiene precautions to prevent the spread of germs. Prevention information was distributed during move-in weekend.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Flu kits are currently being distributed to every student that lives in university housing. The kits include: bio bags, hand sanitizer, fever strips, lozenges, Tylenol, face mask, information about the flu buddy meals-to-go program and general information about the flu. These kits are being distributed by the residential staff in each of the housing areas including family student housing.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Anti-bacterial soap dispensers are being installed in all on-campus residence hall bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Dining Services:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sanitizing gel dispensers or towelettes have been placed in all dining facilities and commonly used surfaces are frequently wiped down with a disinfectant.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Meals are primarily self service with all serving utensils changed out once per hour.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Take-out "Buddy Meals" are available for any student who may become ill.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The Buddy Meal program is available at all Dining Halls and program details are posted at each location.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Dining has the capability to provide meals on a "to-go" basis should circumstances warrant a reduction in social gatherings.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Campus Facilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Physical Plant staff are using a hospital-grade disinfectant to clean campus restrooms. The disinfectant is CDC-approved and considered especially effective for high-touch surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Early Education Services:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Childcare staff have increased frequency of "wipe downs" of child play areas, including tables and climbing structures.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Programs will follow CDC and California state education protocols for school closures should a child be identified as testing positive for the H1N1 virus.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Transportation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>"Cover Your Cough" flyers are being posted in all Campus Transit vehicles, at campus bus stops, and in the lobby of the TAPS Sales Office.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Campus Transit drivers are being reminded to wipe down handrails and door handles on campus shuttle vehicles as part of the vehicle check-out process each day. Drivers are also being directed to use disinfectant wipes steering wheels and other control surfaces when they relieve other drivers for breaks and shift changes.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>When practical, passengers aboard Campus Transit vehicles are encouraged to leave windows open to promote the flow of fresh air through the vehicle.</li>
</ul>

Furniture, dishes, books, and more went flying, and structures shifted off their foundations. Traffic choked the streets. People had to evacuate their homes, so friends helped friends.</p><p>"I was reaching for my car door when it hit," Long Marine Lab staff member Maria Choy was quoted as saying in the October 27, 1989, issue of <i>On Campus,</i> a former UCSC newsletter. "The ground started moving all around me. It was incredible."</p><p>When the Loma Prieta Earthquake struck at 5:04 p.m. on October 17, 1989, the effect on the UCSC campus and immediate environs was dwarfed by the destruction that happened in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in Santa Cruz County--in downtown Santa Cruz, buildings literally crumbled and three people died. Watsonville was hit hard, as well; one person was killed by a toppled building in downtown Watsonville. In all, 63 people in Northern California, including six in Santa Cruz County, perished from the earthquake that day, whose epicenter was in the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park.</p><p>But UCSC didn't completely escape harm in the 7.1-magnitude quake. The campus sustained $11 million in damage and property loss from the fourth-largest quake then ever recorded in California. Cleanup costs on campus were estimated at $1 million.</p><p>For those who experienced it, memories of the shaking linger. </p><p>"It's really vivid in my mind," said Choy, who still works at Long Marine Lab as an administrative specialist/office manager. She had just reached her car outside the trailer that then served as the main office when the temblor began. "The thing that was incredible was to see the ground actually rolling. It was literally rolling. It was like out a movie."</p><p>Heart pounding, she drove to John Street to pick up her small daughter at day care--all the children were safe. </p><p>"You just kind of realize what's really important--you learn to appreciate every day that you get," said Choy. "But it also made me feel like, we have our earthquakes, that's part of living in California. But I'd rather live here than anywhere else. I'll take my chances with the San Andreas fault." </p><p>The fault's slip and its aftermath captured the attention of the world.</p><p>"In the days and weeks that followed the Loma Prieta Earthquake, UC Santa Cruz was a media epicenter for quake coverage," said Jim Burns of University Relations. "Local, regional, national, and even international reporters descended on the campus to interview quake experts from our highly regarded seismology laboratory. I remember, for example, helping a TV crew from Tokyo find their way to one of many press briefings."</p><p>Karen McNally, who was a leading researcher in UCSC's Charles F. Richter Seismological Laboratory (now the W.M. Keck Seismological Laboratory), even appeared on the front page of an Italian newspaper.</p><p>There was no loss of life on campus, however, and the structural damage was not devastating. Only seven minor injuries were reported at UCSC. There was damage to shelving on the upper floors of the McHenry and Science libraries and fireplace and chimney damage in various buildings. Also damaged were ceilings, flooring, interior and exterior walls, retaining walls, roadways, windows, sinks, toilets, lighting fixtures, and gas and water systems.</p><p>Property loss and damage included scientific instruments, computing and general office equipment, torn and water-damaged books and magazines, musical instruments, and artworks.</p><p>Students were evacuated from residence halls and remained outside until structural engineers cleared the dorms for occupancy.</p><p>The campus's gas-powered cogeneration plant produced electricity the night of the earthquake, so portions of the campus had power while the rest of Santa Cruz County experienced a blackout.</p><p>Twenty years later, UCSC has an <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/">Emergency Management</a> program, housed within the UCSC Fire Department. Chris Gaylord, UCSC's emergency manager, said the campus now systematically plans for a variety of emergency situations, including earthquakes.</p><p>The Student Affairs Division also maintains a standing emergency preparedness committee that conducts specific planning and preparedness efforts for the student population, including sheltering, feeding, and care.</p><p>Each year, the UCSC Fire Department trains more than 700 students, faculty, and staff in American Red Cross-certified first aid, CPR, and automated external defibrillator use. Also, since 2005, more than 160 campus faculty and staff have been trained in the Campus Emergency Response Team program, a federal curriculum that encompasses disaster first aid, light search and rescue, and basic fire control.</p><p>The campus's new Emergency Operations Center, which opened in 2008, is equipped with uninterrupted emergency power and redundant communication systems and is used during exercises as well as a variety of planned and unplanned events on campus each year to allow emergency personnel to practice their roles during a major emergency. </p><p>The <a href="http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu">CruzAlert</a> emergency notification system, also implemented in 2008, allows emergency personnel to rapidly communicate important information to the campus during an emergency.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d0de48072704601a012ff046dd3e2"><name>3238</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall events at UCSC</title><start-date>1254466800000</start-date><display-name>Fall events at UCSC...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3238</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3238</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339048869</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339048869</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/luce.120.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/luce.120.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>luce.120.jpg</name><file-size>29257</file-size><width>120</width><height>173</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Edward Luce </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For a complete list of upcoming events this fall, go to UCSC's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/calendar/">Calendar of Events</a>.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>What are the most interesting or surprising things you have learned about the Baskin School of Engineering since your arrival?</strong></p>
<p>There are pockets of excellence that I didn't even know about before I came here. Because the Baskin School of Engineering is a young school, only 11 years old, and is still relatively small, it does not have high national visibility. So after being here for a few months, one of the things I've found surprising and gratifying is that there are so many really bright faculty who are tackling some of the most important problems that are facing our society. And that's what I find exciting.</p>
<p>I've also been impressed by the collaborative nature of our faculty. There's a very good esprit de corps, and people are willing to work together across disciplines, not only within engineering, but also with people in the arts and humanities divisions, in physical and biological sciences, and in the social sciences. So we can build the presence of engineering on this campus as more than just a stand-alone unit, but as a unit that's growing and working well with the other divisions.</p>
<p><strong>What do you see as the school's greatest strengths?</strong></p>
<p>One of its greatest strengths, and one of the reasons for its creation, is its proximity to Silicon Valley. The ability to have face-to-face meetings and develop personal relationships with technology leaders in the Valley makes it easier for us to understand what their real needs are. And this is important for two reasons: We want our research programs to focus on problems that are important to industry, and we want to prepare our students in ways that match the needs of the companies where they will be working.</p>
<p>A second strength is one of the flip sides of our relative youth. In a time of rapidly changing technology, there is an advantage in being young and growing, because it gives us the ability to create new programs as we grow that will position us in the most important areas of technology for the coming decades.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of those key areas of future technological development?</strong></p>
<p>Two big issues that are likely to remain dominant for the foreseeable future are health care and energy. There is tremendous potential for bioinformatics and biotechnology to drive innovation in health care, and that's an important focus of both research and education in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Energy has become incredibly important for both economic and environmental reasons. There is a lot of opportunity for improving how we manage energy. We know that renewable energy sources will be disparate--there won't be one big renewable energy plant down the road. This creates a tremendously complex energy management problem, and the tools to effectively shuttle energy around from where it's created to where it's needed have not yet been created. That's an important area that is well suited to the set of departments we have in the engineering school.</p>
<p><strong>What steps are you taking to position the Baskin School of Engineering to make major contributions to the technologies of the future?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important things we can do is to understand the needs of industry and try to design curricula and research activities to match those needs. That's a very social endeavor. You have to talk to people, spend time with them, and develop long-term relationships. Silicon Valley is arguably the cradle of technological innovation and manufacturing in the U.S. now, so we're in a good position to understand what engineering can do for product innovation and manufacturing. We are also close by three major government institutions--NASA Ames Research Center, the Naval Postgraduate School, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory--and they also have needs for engineering research and education.</p>
<p>So I've been meeting with a lot of people--CEOs, heads of research, and individual investigators--to build those relationships and to ascertain what this area, the greater Silicon Valley area, needs from a publicly supported engineering school.</p>
<p><strong>How are the UC budget cuts affecting your ability move the school in the direction you'd like to go?</strong></p>
<p>We have certainly had to scale back our plans for the growth of the engineering school. Our departments won't be growing at the rate that had been planned in terms of hiring new faculty.</p>
<p>In terms of research funding, however, we have actually increased the amount of external funding for faculty research. A lot of our faculty are young, and they are increasing the amount of research funding they bring in each year, so that has given us a bit of a grace period in these very difficult budget times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cuts are going to have an impact on our ability to deliver the curriculum to our students. That's why we're hoping it's only a short time before this budget crisis is resolved. We are doing all we can to continue to meet the educational needs of our students and to minimize the impact of these cuts. We have students in the pipeline who need to take certain courses to graduate, and meeting the needs of those students is a top priority.</p>
<p><strong>What under-appreciated facts about the Baskin School of Engineering would you like to be better known?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I would like to see broader appreciation of the many areas in which we are doing innovative research and education. But an important quality of the Baskin School of Engineering, and one of the things that has impressed me very much, is that it's a place where creativity is really fostered in a way that you don't find at other institutions. Santa Cruz has a history of being iconoclastic, and I think it benefits from being in a very attractive location that is off the beaten path a bit. We have access to Silicon Valley, but we come back to campus and we can really think about how to change things in a big way. And that's what we've done in bioinformatics, in game design, in electrical engineering and computer engineering, in applied math and statistics, and in technology management.</p>
<p>In all of these fields, we have excellent programs that are pushing the boundaries of engineering. That's the real hidden secret of Santa Cruz that I hope becomes not so hidden.</p>

<p>The TCGA project was highlighted in a White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Recovery-Act-Funding-For-GroundingBreaking-Medical-Research/">announcement</a> this week of $5 billion in grants to fund cutting-edge medical research across the country as part of the economic stimulus package. The TCGA project aims to collect more than 20,000 tissue samples from more than 20 types of cancer, and determine in detail all of the genetic changes in these tumor samples.</p>
<p>David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, leads a group of bioinformatics experts in the Baskin School of Engineering who were involved in the TCGA pilot project, which was designed to assess the feasibility of the large-scale effort now getting under way. The UCSC group will collaborate with clinical partners at the Buck Institute for Age Research in Novato to establish the Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center.</p>
<p>"Our role is to develop the technology to read in all the data from TCGA and analyze it to determine which information is useful for designing better treatment strategies," said Haussler, who directs UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. "We're not just looking at one or two genes; we get millions of data points for every tumor. That's unprecedented, and we need enormous computer power to handle that."</p>
<p>TCGA was awarded $175 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, plus $50 million each from NCI and NHGRI. The UCSC-Buck Institute center will receive $5.6 million in funding over five years from NCI.</p>
<p>Haussler's bioinformatics team created and maintains the widely used <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>. More recently, they developed a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2802">Cancer Genomics Browser</a> designed to help researchers find patterns in large sets of clinical and genomic data from cancer studies.</p>
<p>"What's unique at UCSC is that we are able to use our Genome Browser format to build a platform for cancer genome informatics," Haussler said. "We are bringing all of our genomics prowess to bear on this new area of research, and we've been able to leverage the talents and infrastructure already established at UCSC."</p>
<p>TCGA is a comprehensive effort to map the genomic changes that occur in major types and subtypes of cancer. In all types of cancer, glitches in a cell's complete set of DNA, or genome, lead to uncontrolled cell growth. The comprehensive maps created by TCGA will show what is wrong in the genome of each type of cancer. This information, which will be rapidly deposited into public databases for use by the worldwide research community, will accelerate efforts to find better ways of diagnosing, treating, and preventing cancer.</p>
<p>"We hope that the information we learn will ultimately be used to design individualized treatments for cancer patients," Haussler said. "Every tumor is different, and that's what makes cancer such a difficult disease to treat. The big challenge is to work out which combinations of drugs are most effective for individual patients."</p>
<p>More than a dozen researchers are involved in the Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center. In addition to Haussler, they include Joshua Stuart, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC; Christopher Benz, M.D., a program director at the Buck Institute and adjunct professor of medicine at UCSF; UCSC graduate students Stephen Benz, Zack Sanborn, and Chris Szeto; and UCSC postdoctoral researchers Jing Zhu and Ting Wang.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d26588072704601a012ff41ff5d7a"><name>3252</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Five faculty members win 2009 NSF CAREER awards</title><summary>Five UCSC faculty members have won NSF CAREER awards in 2009.</summary><author>Daniel Strain (831) 459-2495; dstrain@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>William Dunbar, Pascale Garaud, Joshua Stuart, Yat Li, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, CAREER Award</keywords><description>Five UCSC faculty members have won NSF CAREER awards in 2009.</description><start-date>1254380400000</start-date><display-name>Five faculty members win...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3252</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3252</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339055129</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339055129</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Daniel Strain</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>dstrain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/dunbar_150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/dunbar_150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dunbar_150.jpg</name><file-size>30825</file-size><width>150</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>William Dunbar</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/garaud_150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/garaud_150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>garaud_150.jpg</name><file-size>34855</file-size><width>150</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Pascale Garaud</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/stuart_150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/stuart_150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stuart_150.jpg</name><file-size>28301</file-size><width>150</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Joshua Stuart</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/yatli.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/yatli.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yatli.jpg</name><file-size>32527</file-size><width>140</width><height>163</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Yat Li</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Five UC Santa Cruz faculty members have won prestigious Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) awards from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2009. Three of the recipients are faculty in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering: William Dunbar, assistant professor of computer engineering; Pascale Garaud, assistant professor of applied mathematics and statistics; and Joshua Stuart, associate professor of biomolecular engineering. The others are Yat Li, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, both in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p><p>NSF presents the CAREER award to faculty "who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research." The awards provide funding to support the recipients' research, teaching, and outreach activities.</p><p>Using nanopore technology pioneered at UCSC, Dunbar examines single molecules of DNA and the dynamics of enzyme interactions with DNA molecules. The nanopores are tiny channels in membrane-bound proteins that allow the passage of only a single molecule or polymer chain. Dunbar's research focuses on the direct control of DNA molecules inside these protein channels, allowing in-depth study of enzymes that bind to the DNA. His CAREER award, totalling $400,000 over five years, also supports education and outreach efforts that include high school, undergraduate, and graduate courses at UCSC. Dunbar also recently received a $460,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to fund related research.</p><p>Garaud's research interests cover a broad range of topics in astrophysical fluid dynamics. In particular, one of her research topics focuses on the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the interior dynamics of stars. Her CAREER award ($795,000 over five years) will support the creation of a computational model of stellar evolution that takes into account magnetic fields, rotation, and other associated dynamical effects. Garaud is also developing the International Summer Institute for Modeling in Astrophysics, a multidisciplinary research forum for international faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. Beginning in 2010, the institute will be held alternately in Santa Cruz and abroad.</p><p>Stuart uses computational models to study the genome-wide effects of interactions between genes. A single gene responding to environmental stimuli, for instance, can activate or change the function of any number of other genes. Stuart studies networks of gene interactions in both normal and abnormal cells in an attempt to discover the pathways that cause diseases like cancer. His CAREER award ($1.1 million over five years) also supports the expansion of the UCSC Interaction Browser, available through the UCSC Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu), which provides researchers around the world with free access to a wide database of genetic interactions. </p><p>Li investigates the construction and application of semiconductor nanowires, ultrathin inorganic "wires" that grow in a controlled form. Li designs and synthesizes these nanowires to study their fundamental electronic and optical properties, and explores their function as electrically driven nanolasers, microscopic devices that emit light in a controlled manner. These devices may lead to significant advancements in the fields of nanoscale electronics and photonics. Li will also use his CAREER award ($400,000 over five years) to support UCSC undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds working on their own research projects in his lab.</p><p>Ramirez-Ruiz studies compact objects such as neutron stars and white dwarf stars.

This week's cyber security "Tip of the Week" from ITS focuses on avoiding scams designed to infect your computer or steal information and passwords.</p>
<p>Criminals and hackers are constantly coming up with new schemes designed to compromise computers, steal personal or private information or passwords, or trick you out of money. Even as more "traditional" phishing scams continue, new ploys are emerging to trick you into clicking on malicious links or installing harmful software on your computer. Two scams that seem to be picking up steam right now are:</p>
<p>1. Malicious "tiny URLs": These are links to malicious web sites that have been shortened so you can't tell by looking at them where they will take you.</p>
<p>2. Malicious links to fake videos: In this scam, you are urged to click on a link to a video. When you click on the link, you get a message that you need to install a missing video plug-in to see the video. The fake plug-in is harmful software that will infect your computer.</p>
<p>Both of these scams are especially common on Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace, but they also show up in spam and instant messages (IM).</p>
<p>Here are a few pointers to avoid getting fooled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only click on links from trusted sources. Never click on a link from a "mystery source" unless you have a way to independently verify that it is safe. 


</li>
<li>Delete unsolicited e-mails; don't open, forward, reply to, or click on links or attachments in them. 


</li>
<li>Don't give private information to anyone you don't know or who doesn't have a legitimate need for it (in person, over the phone, via e-mail or the Internet). 


</li>
<li>You should never disclose your password to anyone, even if they say they work for UCSC, ITS, or other campus organizations. 


</li>
<li>If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you want to investigate something, look it up on your own (e.g., do a Google search) instead of clicking on an unknown or unsolicited link.</li>
</ul>

<p>The show is an intimate look at the process of trial and error that lies behind the complex work of artists and scientists.</p>
<p>Co-curated by associate professor of art Melissa Gwyn and associate professor of chemistry Scott Lokey, it features collaborative projects by UCSC arts and science faculty and lab researchers.</p>
<p>A mix of both art and artifacts, the exhibition includes painting, photography, sculpture, models, photography, microscopic images, installation and computer animation.</p>
<p>Gwyn noted that signage will be presented alongside the art that explains "the research behind the science, and the ideas behind the art."</p>

<p>The projects in the exhibition are all the result of creative exchange, shared ideas and materials, and cooperative working methods between artists and scientists.</p>
<p>"This is a collaboration between science and art faculty that considers the role of failure as a generative process," said Gwyn. A failed project can often lead to a number of digressions that accumulate to become something else."</p>
<p>"It is the aim of this exhibition to examine failure as an integral process for creative and scientific inquiry," Gwyn added.</p>
<p>Full Disclosure's featured projects and collaborations will include:</p>
<p>. Professor David Deamer (Chemistry and Biochemistry) and Professor Melissa Gwyn (Art)</p>
<p>. Professor Elliot Anderson (Art) and Professor Russ Flegal</p>
<p>(Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology)</p>
<p>. Professor Scott Lokey (Chemistry and Biochemistry) and Professor E.G. Crichton (Art)</p>
<p>. Lokey Research Group graduate students and research associates: Dr. Nadine Gassner, Rushia Turner, Yvette Mimieux, Caitlin Binder, Genevieve Halpenny, Rachel Steinhardt, Laura Kapitzky, Jonathan Bock, Mai Vuong, Tina White, Chad Renzelman, Tiffani Quan, Walter Bray</p>
<p>. Professor Frank Galuszka (Art) and Professor Ralph Abraham (Math)</p>
<p>. Dustin Updike (Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, laboratory of Professor Susan Strome) and Professor Melissa Gwyn (Art)</p>
<p>. Professor Norman Locks (Art) and Brian Petersen (Environmental Studies)</p>

These committees deal with critical policy issues that affect every student in the UC system (e.g. admissions policy, budget priorities, sustainability practices, diversity issues and technology investments). It is vital that UC students have strong representatives on these committees. There are over 20 different committees with over 9 student representative positions that need to be filled for the 2009-10 school year. Applications due October 15th.</p><p>Representative Expectations:</p><p>-Serve the full term (one-year in most cases, two-years for a few committees)</p><p>-Attend and actively participate in committee meetings (transportation is reimbursed by UC Office of the President or the committee)</p><p>-Maintain communication with UCSA and provide recommendations to the UCSA Board on policy stances</p><p>-Articulate UCSA stances to their committee</p><p>Committees that need representatives:</p><p>-University Committee on Academic Freedom - Grad representative</p><p>-Designated Suppliers Program - Undergrad representative</p><p>-University Committee on Computers and Communications - Grad representative</p><p>-Intersegmental Coordinating Committee- Grad representative</p><p>-Student Mental Health Oversight Committee - Undergrad representative</p><p>-UC Sustainability Steering Committee - Grad representative</p><p>-University Committee on International Education - Grad representative</p><p>-Apply UC -- Undergrad representative</p><p>To find out more information about the committees, please go to: <a href="http://www.ucsa.org/involved/syscomm.php">http://www.ucsa.org/involved/syscomm.php</a></p><p>Student of Color Conference:</p><p>In addition to these system-wide committees, you can also get involved by attending the Student of Color Conference, November 13th - 15th at UC San Diego. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=119735157275">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=119735157275</a></p><p>The Student Union Assembly (SUA) is recruiting a UCSC Delegation to Attend the Conference.</p><p>From all across the state, students of color (and allies) will be coming together in San Diego for the 21st Annual University of California Student Association (UCSA), Student of Color Conference. This year's theme is: Building Our Leaders with Purpose: Activism, Wellness and Reclaiming Our Education. These three aspects take center stage because of the need to create a healthy life balance for student activists, particularly those organizing in or around issues that affect communities of color. The conference provides a venue for students to meet leaders from across the UC system and engage in powerful, informative, and enlightening workshops in hopes that a bigger network of relationships and knowledge can be created to allow us to organize more effectively as this year unfolds. This year, we're facing fee increases of around 32%--of which directly affect our communities. Join as we build a bigger student movement. Here's how to apply.</p><p>The application is due Friday October 16th in the Student Union Assembly Office, which is located on the top floor of the Student Union Building, directly across from the Bay Tree Building. Anyone is welcome to apply!

This time, however, her team began the expedition during the Antarctic winter, the harshest season in the harshest environment on Earth.</p>
<p>From a remote field site on the Antarctic sea ice, the researchers are posting notes, photos, and video on an expedition <a href="http://antarctica.ucsc.edu">web site</a>.</p>
<p>Their goal is to discover how Weddell seals survive the winter beneath the sea ice of McMurdo Sound. The Weddell seal is the only mammal, other than well-equipped humans such as Williams and her colleagues, to live in McMurdo Sound during the brutal winter months.</p>
<p>"We have already gone through a 100-degree change in wind-chill temperatures, from minus 100 to 0 degrees Fahrenheit," said Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, in an e-mail.</p>
<p>In 2001, Williams studied the underwater world of Weddel seals during the Antarctic summer using video cameras worn by the seals during their dives beneath the ice. That expedition was also documented on a web site (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/11-12/antarctic.html">earlier story</a>), and Williams described her adventures studying Weddell seals in a 2004 book, <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/03-04/04-26/williams.html"><em>The Hunter's Breath</em></a>.</p>
<p>This year, thanks to technological improvements, the monitoring equipment is smaller and more sophisticated than ever, giving the team a new perspective on the lives of Weddell seals. The miniaturized instrument packs worn by the seals record what they see and hear underwater, monitor where they go, and even record the ocean temperatures and other environmental conditions they encounter.</p>
<p>Williams said she is particularly interested in how the seals will respond to changes in their environment caused by global warming. "The seals are monitoring marked changes in the polar environment that will ultimately dictate their survival," she said.</p>
<p>The researchers will be posting updates on the web site each week for eight weeks. The nine members of the expedition team include researchers from UCSC, Texas A&amp;M University, and University of Texas. Their expedition is funded by the National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs.</p>

<p>From roots in computer gaming, interactive digital media are evolving at light speed, becoming vastly more complex and realistic. Richer cinematography and more sophisticated narratives give these "playable media" increasing emotional power and offer more ways for players to author a game's action and outcome.</p>
<p>At the same time, in what are often called "serious games," game-based technologies are transforming education and training in fields such as medicine and emergency response.</p>
<p>Many of these innovations will also have an impact on other media, including film.</p>
<p>"We rely on collaboration and partnership with universities for many of the innovations that fuel our industry," says <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall09/article.asp?pid=3260">Ed Catmull</a>, cofounder of Pixar and president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. "Many of the most exciting new artistic and technological ideas in the field come from the academic community."</p>
<p>UCSC's computer game design program is creating the future of interactive media. This highly interdisciplinary program meshes engineering, the latest film and new media techniques, as well as research in literary theory, linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>"I see this as a time of enormous potential," says <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jhala/">Arnav Jhala,</a> assistant professor of computer science in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a>. "With the techniques of gaming, film, arts, humanities, and instructional materials all merging, I feel very lucky to be in this field right now."</p>
<p>The program has become a magnet for top faculty and students from around the country, with Jhala and computer science assistant professor <a href="http://www.noahwf.com/">Noah Wardrip-Fruin</a> being two of the latest additions.</p>
<p>One reason computer games are so compelling, says Wardrip-Fruin, is the sense of "agency" they offer players-that satisfying feeling of taking virtual action and changing the virtual world. He wants to create more "intelligent" games that allow players to exercise the kinds of creative strategies used in chess, for example, but applied instead to fictional worlds that respond coherently.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>He is therefore exploring ways to generate a much broader range of potential game pathways and more ways for users to shape games as they play.</p>
<p>"In other words," he says, "the software won't need to encode hundreds of ways for [Raymond Chandler's fictional detective Philip] Marlowe to solve the mystery, but can instead give players the power to explore, investigate, and decide how to use their knowledge."</p>
<p>Jhala is working to expand the emotional and visual power of games.</p>
<p>"Today's games engage the player at the skill or reactive level," says Jhala, "but not at the deeper emotional or 'mood' level. As games evolve we will expect them to deliver powerful experiences that compare with film."</p>
<p>One of Jhala's research specialties is cinematic communication, analyzing how filmmakers use techniques such as camera angle, lighting, color, and sound to communicate with audiences.</p>
<p>Jhala likens his research to the study of spoken language-but focusing instead on human visual communication. "We're trying to understand how filmmakers communicate visually on an emotional level and apply that to gaming to make it more compelling."</p>
<p>Jhala is also applying AI techniques to make games more interactive. For example, what if a game were "smart" enough to know when a player is stuck and could subtly point her in the right direction? A slight shift in camera angle or lighting, for example, might emphasize clues the player has missed.</p>
<p>Innovations like these are only the beginning, says Wardrip-Fruin. "This stage in the history of interactive media is analogous to the period when novels were first emerging, or when films became more than just acting out a play in front of a camera."</p>

<p>If you could travel through time to the beach on Okinawa in 1945, how would it change your perceptions of World War II? By expanding the ways we learn and communicate about the war's history, historians Alice Yang and Alan Christy hope to also expand our understanding and awareness.</p>
<p>Through UCSC's <a href="http://cspwm.ucsc.edu/Site/About.html">Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories,</a> the two historians are building an international online community focused on the history of WWII in the Pacific. The project recently received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
<p>The center grew out of Yang and Christy's enormously popular UCSC undergraduate course on WWII history. A major issue for the course was the lack of historical source materials in English.</p>
<p>"We wanted to give our students greater access to information," says Christy, "without teaching all of them Japanese in one quarter."</p>
<p>They also kept wishing their students could actually visit key WWII sites. The southern tip of Okinawa island, site of the war's last land battle, is one such place.</p>
<p>"We can't load students on a plane to Okinawa," notes Christy, "but maybe we can bring Okinawa to them in a way that's experiential."</p>

<p class="prCaption" style="font-size:10px;">Alan Christy</p>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The center's interactive web site, "Eternal Flames: Living Memories of the Pacific War," will link researchers, students, and those who experienced WWII to shape a multinational, multilingual view of the conflict. "Eternal Flames" will integrate the features of a web-based digital archive, an interactive "wiki," and an online forum. It will provide unprecedented large-scale linking and translation of a wide range of historical documents.</p>
<p>Yang and Christy have also teamed up with <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~mantey/">Pat Mantey</a>, Jack Baskin Professor of Engineering, to facilitate experiential learning and international communication. Using Mantey's "hyperwall," a large array of 40 flat-panel video screens, they will virtually transport UCSC viewers to Okinawa's massive memorial complex, the Cornerstone of Peace.</p>

<p class="prCaption" style="font-size:10px;">Alice Yang</p>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Using historical photos, maps, and other materials, the hyperwall will also become a time machine, enabling viewers to tour the complex as it is today, then peel back "layers" to experience the same site through history. Future plans include installing similar hyperwalls in Okinawa and elsewhere to support teleconferencing and virtual networking.</p>
<p>Yang emphasizes that the project is more than a research and teaching tool: "Ultimately, we're connecting people to people, building bridges between historians and the public, and getting students involved in collaborative projects like oral histories."</p>
<p>Yang's research explores human rights violations related to the war, including the internment of Japanese Americans, military sexual slavery, POW treatment, and the Nanjing massacre. These issues remain very much alive today, and her hope is that the site will bridge cultural boundaries to shed light on these and other ongoing debates.</p>

"Eternal Flames: Living Memories of the Pacific War" and the hyperwall are under construction. Christy anticipates both being live in late 2010.<br/>

<p>These are excerpts from <em><a href="http://publicsecret.net">Public Secrets</a>,</em> a powerful online documentary created by professor <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/faculty/sharon_daniel">Sharon Daniel.</a></p>
<p>Through <em>Public Secrets,</em> women in a California prison share their stories in candid and moving recorded narratives. They talk about their children, their mistakes, and their futures, and also about the injustices of the criminal justice system and the failures of the prison health care system.</p>
<p>"Their collective voices challenge our assumptions about crime and punishment, justice and injustice," says Daniel, of UCSC's <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/">Film and Digital Media Department,</a> who is also chair of the interdisciplinary <a href="http://digitalarts.ucsc.edu/">Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A.</a> program.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Art is about changing awareness, perception, and understanding," she adds. "That change can be purely aesthetic or emotional, but my interest is in catalyzing social change and promoting social justice."</p>
<p>The visual presentation of <em>Public Secrets</em> is stark but compelling and dynamic, with block quotes from the narratives emerging, shifting, and vying for attention on the screen. We don't see photos of the women, but we hear their voices, and without seeing their faces we are allowed to create our own mental pictures of women who could be our mothers, our sisters, our friends.</p>
<p>"We take prisons for granted but are often afraid to face the realities they produce," says Angela Davis, professor emerita of history of consciousness at UC Santa Cruz in her book <em>Are Prisons Obsolete?</em> "We thus think about imprisonment as a fate reserved for others, a fate reserved for the 'evildoers'... relieving us of the responsibility of thinking about the real issues afflicting those communities from which prisoners are drawn in such disproportionate numbers."</p>
<p><em>Public Secrets</em> is the first of three "database driven" new media documentaries in which Daniel explores realities often hidden from public view. The second piece in the series, <em>Blood Sugar</em> (now in the final production stage), shares the stories of people trapped in drug and alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>Daniel says that database technology makes it possible to create what she calls "multi-vocal" narratives. She sees herself as a context provider, giving voice to those shut out of the digital revolution.</p>
<p>"I ask the participants to share their experiences, then present their stories as transparently as possible, without adding an overall 'authorial voice,'" she says. "All of their diverse voices, including mine, come together in the work."</p>
<p>As with all of Daniel's work, the underlying structure of <em>Public Secrets,</em> its "data architecture," was shaped by the content of the stories. Rather than the typical drill-down website architecture, <em>Public Secrets</em> uses an array-like structure that invites exploration by topic and encourages connections across topics.</p>
<p>It also creates a "virtual space" that reflects the inside/outside dichotomy shared by many of the stories.</p>
<p>"It is as though these collective voices comprise a 100-square-mile territory," says Daniel. "I set the viewer down in the middle of this territory and allow them to come to an understanding of it through exploration-making choices and pursuing pathways based on their own interests and reactions."</p>

<em>Public Secrets,</em> created in collaboration with designer Erik Loyer, was first presented in the online <a href="http://www.vectorsjournal.org"><em>Vectors Journal</em></a>. It was an Official Honoree of the 2007 Webby Awards.<br/>

Sideman, <a href="mailto:review@ucsc.edu">review@ucsc.edu</a></i></p><p><a href="http://astro.ucsc.edu/research/faculty/krumholz/index.html">Mark Krumholz</a> came to UC Santa Cruz last year after completing three prestigious postdoctoral fellowships at Princeton University. He could have taught anywhere, his colleagues say, but UCSC was his first choice.  Besides its status as a world-class research center, the <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/">Astronomy and Astrophysics Department</a>, he said, also offers a friendly and collegial environment.</p><p>The rookie professor, 32, may study the skies, but he has his feet planted firmly on the ground. He taught astronomy at San Quentin State Prison and continues to advocate for college-level inmate education in Santa Cruz County. While a grad student at UC Berkeley, he volunteered long hours as a top officer with the teaching assistants union. He recently led a statewide campaign to preserve research funding in the UC system.</p><p>"Just because we're scientists doesn't mean you can forget about the fact that you're a citizen, too," said Krumholz.</p><p>Last spring, he launched a volunteer teaching program at Santa Cruz County Jail. Through classes such as algebra, Krumholz imparts to inmates a strong message that better jobs await those with quantitative skills.</p><p>Krumholz's own schooling was carved out by his love of computers and physics. Growing up glued to his computer screen in the suburbs, he admits to not seeing the Milky Way until he became a grad student.</p><p>His pioneering research marries for the first time the two fields of star formation and galaxy formation.</p><p>That's why his resume floated to the top of potential candidates for the job, said department chair <a href="http://astro.ucsc.edu/research/faculty/faber/index.html">Sandy Faber</a>.</p><p>"This is one of the few great departments in the country where you can study both," Faber said. "He and the other new professors are the future of our department."</p><p>That's why it's critical, Faber said, that even in the midst of fiscal difficulties, UC retain the top talent it's attracted.</p><p>One day last summer, Krumholz sat down at his computer and pounded out a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in which he challenged the state of California to preserve funding for the sciences at UC or risk losing talented young professors and world-class programs that are already stretched to their breaking point.</p><p>With the help of fellow faculty members, the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/national-academies_letter.pdf">letter</a> gained momentum. It garnered national attention after being signed by a group of 300 of UC's most prominent professors, all members of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.</p><p>But Krumholz is turning his attention to the new academic year. He has secured time at two of the nation's supercomputer sites to run his simulations. He'll be working closely with grad students and teaching an undergrad course called <i>Physics of Stars.</i></p><p>"The students have all arrived and I'm very impressed," he said.

<p>Growing up in a city the FBI once ranked the 15th most dangerous in the United States, Erica Terrell would walk home from school past drunks asking for money, past gang graffiti, past kids who had dropped out of school.</p>
<p>As much as Terrell loved her community of Compton, Calif., she knew there were things that needed to be changed. Today, Terrell is a senior American studies major at UC Santa Cruz with the goal of doing just that: helping her hometown become a healthier place to live.</p>
<p>"Change isn't going to happen if people are not willing to step up," said the 20-year-old.</p>

<p>Terrell's parents had always emphasized college as the key to success, but until she got to junior high, Terrell said, she was largely an unmotivated student. Then, she was enrolled in a program emphasizing math, science, and engineering. Teachers set goals and there were academic matches.</p>
<p>"My competitive side kicked in," Terrell said.</p>

<p>By the time she was 16, Terrell was enrolled in the King Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles, doing cancer research at a nearby hospital.</p>
<p>"We were looking at multi-drug resistance in prostate cancer," Terrell said. "I was culturing cancer cells and treating them with different chemotherapy drugs."</p>

<p>The lab became a sanctuary for Terrell and set her on a path to UCSC.</p>

<p>It was in Santa Cruz that Terrell discovered markets filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. In Compton, liquor stores had dotted most corners and markets were stocked with candy and cheap, processed foods.</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to see the end product of that kind of economic and development planning: obesity, diabetes, and substance abuse. So with the inspiration of professors like Reyna Ramirez, Aaronette White, and Andrea Steiner, Terrell turned her focus toward public health policy.</p>

<p>Working this summer to revise the master plan for Richmond, Calif., Terrell helped write a checklist for new development that included public health components like open space, wider sidewalks, and restrictions on liquor stores.</p>
<p>Her own life also became a reflection of her studies. With healthier eating and regular trips to the gym, the 5-foot-2 Terrell lost 25 pounds in nine months and found herself filled with energy and focus.</p>
<p>"In my freshman year, I would fall asleep in class," Terrell said. Last year, she took five classes, had a job, and earned a 3.57 GPA. To her, that was concrete evidence of the benefits of a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>With the aid of two alumni scholarships that totaled $5,000, Terrell is continuing her education at UCSC. "The support of the Alumni Association lifted a tremendous burden during my junior and senior year," she said. It also added to her overall confidence as a student.</p>

<p>She is now applying to graduate school with plans to use her education, not for personal gain, but for the gain of her hometown by working for health policy changes.</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, there's no place like home," Terrell said, "and I want to make the best of it for someone else."</p>

<p>Justin Coupe and Palmer Taylor became friends in a place everyone called "The Tennis House." It was a rambling, wood-sided home on Santa Cruz's east side that, at any one time, housed from seven to 11 members of the UCSC tennis team.</p>
<p>"We both took academics very seriously," Coupe said of the early days of their friendship. They also shared a love of fly-fishing handed down from their fathers.</p>
<p>The result of that partnership is the award-winning, 86-minute documentary <a href="http://www.riversofalostcoast.com"><em>Rivers of a Lost Coast</em></a>.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of a fanatical group of anglers who fished for steelhead on the rivers of Northern California, and the freefall of those fisheries over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>"We thought the history would be lost forever if we didn't capture it soon," said Taylor.</p>
<p>Coupe, a 29-year-old film and digital media major who minored in creative writing and literature at UCSC, and Taylor, a 27-year-old applied physics major with a minor in electronic music, began their project four years ago with a few thousand dollars in the bank and rumors of an off-kilter angler named Bill Schaadt in their heads.</p>
<p>Digging through faded photographs, driving from Livingtston, Montana, to Hollywood in their salvaged Ford Ranger, and sometimes forced to prove their fishing skills to dubious anglers, the friends coaxed stories out of a score of grizzled fly-fisherman who told of a time when steelhead and salmon seemed limitless and when heroes were born.</p>
<p>The rivermen told the story of Schaadt flipping his car on the way to the Eel River and of how he climbed out, ran the rest of the way to the water, and only summoned a tow truck after it was too dark to fish.</p>
<p>They told stories of clandestine treks to secret fishing spots, of carefully crossing rivers because there were so many salmon they could knock an angler down. Then, finally, how everything crashed, the victim of a perfect storm of floods, logging, dam construction, and overfishing.</p>
<p>It was a project that exhausted and exhilarated the filmmakers, and there were days, Taylor said, when each woke up in a cold sweat "wondering what we were doing with our lives."</p>
<p>But, said both men, they had learned a lesson while on Bob Hansen's tennis team. "We learned that you can put a major task in front of you and if you work hard and smart you can accomplish things you never thought you could accomplish," Coupe said.</p>
<p>Their film, which cost about $100,000 to make, will be out in DVD in mid-October and is expected to turn a profit, much to the filmmakers' relief. It also proved a point about a changing movie industry. With the marketing tools of the Internet, a niche film like theirs can connect to a far-flung audience.</p>
<p>Living in the Sacramento area now, the pair is working on a new documentary called "Cloud's Rest" about a young man with cerebral palsy who, in an undertaking that took 30 people, climbed to the top of a 9,934-foot peak near Yosemite.</p>
<p>The trouble is, all that work doesn't leave them much time to fish.</p>

<p>It sounds improbable, paradoxical, amusingly far-fetched: a robot romance wrapped around an environmental message. But when the world saw Pixar's <em>WALL-E,</em> it all made a kind of brilliant sense.</p>
<p>The teamwork, creativity, social awareness, and love for a great story that gave birth to that big-hearted 'droid (as well to films like <em>Up, Toy Story,</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em>), make Pixar's <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall09/article.asp?pid=3260">Ed Catmull</a> a role model at UC Santa Cruz. His visionary pairing of high-tech innovation with artistic collaboration seems tailor-made for a campus that prides itself on blazing new and interdisciplinary trails.</p>
<p>At UCSC, art and technology are already close friends. The campus's pioneering <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu">Film and Digital Media Department</a> is known for its effective meshing of theoretical research with hands-on filmmaking experience, and its <a href="http://digitalarts.ucsc.edu">Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A.</a> program attracts top talent from around the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, UCSC's <a href="http://www.cs.ucsc.edu/">computer science</a> and <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">engineering</a> programs collaborate across the disciplines to change the ways we play games, explore history, and share stories about our lives.</p>
<p><strong>The play's the thing: The future of interactive media</strong></p>

<p>From roots in computer gaming, interactive digital media are evolving at light speed, becoming vastly more complex and realistic. Richer cinematography and more sophisticated narratives give these "playable media" increasing emotional power and offer more ways for players to "author" a game's action and outcome.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>At the same time, in what are often called "serious games," game-based technologies are transforming education and training in fields such as medicine and emergency response. <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall09/article.asp?pid=3263" rel="bookmark">Read more »</a></p>

If you could travel through time to the beach on Okinawa in 1945, how would it change your perceptions of World War II? By expanding the ways we learn and communicate about the war's history, historians Alice Yang and Alan Christy hope to also expand our understanding and awareness.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Through UCSC's Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories, the two historians are building an international online community focused on the history of WWII in the Pacific. <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall09/article.asp?pid=3265" rel="bookmark">Read more »</a></p>

Professor Sharon Daniel's online documentary about women in prison gives a voice to those shut out of the digital revolution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Through Daniel's <em>Public Secrets</em> project, women in a California prison share their lives in candid and moving narratives. They talk about their children, their mistakes, and their futures, and also about the injustices of the criminal justice system and the failures of the prison health care system. <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall09/article.asp?pid=3266" rel="bookmark">Read more »</a></p>

While the vast majority of adults recover within 5-7 days, there have been rare hospitalizations, and even deaths, from this infection in otherwise healthy college students.</p><p>We are taking steps to help prevent the spread of flu -- both seasonal and H1N1 -- at UCSC.  But we also want you to be informed, and take steps to protect yourself.</p><p>On the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/flu/article.asp?pid=2893">campus's Flu web site</a> we are posting information regularly that includes precautions recommended by public health officers and advice if you experience flu symptoms.</p><p>I encourage you to follow these five steps:</p><p><b>. Practice good hand hygiene by washing your hands frequently with soap and water </b> -- especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used when handwashing is not convenient.</p><p><b>. Practice respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</b> If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow or shoulder, not your hands.</p><p><b>. Know the signs and symptoms of the flu.</b>  The flu is different from a typical cold; it usually begins abruptly and is associated with muscle aches, headache, chills and fever.  "Fever" is a temperature taken with a thermometer that is equal to or greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.  It is a good idea to obtain a thermometer before you are sick and need it.</p><p>Most college students who come down with the H1N1 flu will improve on the 3rd or 4th day with simple <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2009/09/influenza_self-care-guidelines.pdf">self care</a> that includes rest, over-the-counter fever reducers and pain relievers (ibuprofen or acetaminophen also known as advil, motrin or Tylenol), and fluids.  Students should voluntarily isolate in their rooms until they are free of fever for 24 hours (after discontinuing fever-controlling medication).  Rarely, otherwise-healthy college students with this infection will develop pneumonia.  In severe cases, hospitalization may be needed.  This quarter, two UCSC students living off-campus have been hospitalized with pneumonia from probable H1N1 influenza. Nationwide, there have been four deaths among college students attributed to the H1N1 influenza infection.</p><p><b>. Students with a flu-like illness who are feeling worse on the 3rd day of illness should seek medical evaluation.</b> Severe symptoms that warrant medical evaluation include shortness of breath, severe lightheadedness or dizziness, fever lasting more than 3 days or severe vomiting and the inability to hold down liquids.  Students who have asthma, diabetes or other conditions that may lower their immunity should seek medical evaluation if they develop a fever, even if their symptoms are not otherwise severe; they may benefit from early treatment with antiviral medicine.  It is typical for fever and body aches to resolve by the third day but congestion, sore throat and cough may persist 1-2 weeks.  Over-the-counter remedies can be used to control these symptoms as the infection is resolving.</p><p><b>. Please call the UCSC Student Influenza phone advice line (831-459-2591) if you are unsure if you need medical evaluation.</b> Please also check the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/">Student Health Center web site</a> for after-hours information when the health center is closed in the evening and on weekends.</p><p>Thank you for your attention to this very important health issue.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin> Dr. Drew Malloy, Medical Director, UCSC Student Health Center</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d4ef28072704601a012ff67f5305c"><name>3278</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cyber security month tip, week 2: Minimize stored identity info</title><summary>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month.

This week's cyber security "tip of the week" from ITS focuses on protecting personal identity information (PII) by reducing storage of this data.</p>
<p><strong>What is personal identity information (PII)?</strong></p>
<p>PII is identity theft information, such as Social Security number, driver's license or state ID card number, financial account or credit card numbers, and personal medical/medical insurance information. This is the some of the most sensitive information we handle at UCSC. Not only is the safety of people's identities in our hands, but we are required by law to notify people if their PII has been accessed without authorization. Most of you have probably seen examples of this in the news over the past few years, including several major incidents from the different UC campuses.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting PII</strong></p>
<p>The best way to protect PII is not to have it on your computer in the first place. That way, if your machine gets stolen, or compromised by a virus, or hacked into, you won't be at the center of having to notify people their personal information has been compromised. Some specific recommendations are:</p>
<p>Delete PII whenever you can. Keep it off of your workstation, laptop computer, and other electronic devices if at all possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't even store it temporarily if you can avoid it--not even if it's encrypted. 


</li>
<li>Be sure to check for old files, e-mail, and attachments that may contain PII, especially those from before 2004 when ID numbers tended to be Social Security numbers. 


</li>
<li>Additional information about PII, including common places where it can be found, is available on ITS's <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security_awareness/pii.php">Security Awareness web site</a>. 

<p>If you absolutely have to store PII, work with ITS to make sure it is protected properly.</p>
<p>If you learn that something with PII is missing or may have been infected or hacked into, report it to the ITS Support Center immediately: <a href="mailto: help@ucsc.edu">help@ucsc.edu</a>, <a href="http://itrequest.ucsc.edu">itrequest.ucsc.edu</a>, 459-HELP. Also report stolen or missing equipment to the campus police: 459-2231.</p>
<p>For questions contact the ITS Support Center.</p>
<p>Additional cyber security information is available on the ITS <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security_awareness/">Security Awareness Web site</a>.</p>

He added that due to highly successful fundraising efforts from last December, a portion of those funds helped SSC meet its projected budget for the year.</p><p>SSC raised $419,000 in December after it was announced that the company would have to raise $300,000 in a less than two weeks to continue its annual season in 2009. Funds came from more than 2,000 individual donors throughout Santa Cruz County and nationwide, with the majority of gifts in the $25 to $100 range.</p><p>"What has been wonderful about this season is that so many different people deserve credit for Shakespeare Santa Cruz's success," said Yager, "including Arts Division staff, Development staff, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the community, all the people who bought tickets (including faculty and staff), and the many financial supporters who donated from all across the country, and as far away as Italy," </p><p>"We will focus in the coming year on continuing to maintain the high quality of the performances, and continuing to integrate the company into the campus's core academic mission," Yager added.</p><p>2010 will be the third season for SSC artistic director Barricelli, a veteran theater actor whose resumé includes stints at A.C.T. in San Francisco and at Ashland's Oregon Shakespeare Festival. </p><p>"I am thrilled that after many trials and tribulations, Shakespeare Santa Cruz completed an extraordinarily successful season for the summer of '09--both artistically and fiscally," Barricelli noted. "I am extremely proud that we were able to maintain the level of artistic integrity everyone has come to expect from SSC, while reining in the expenditures and actually coming in under budget in that regard."</p><p>"I am also extremely pleased to begin this new partnership with Dean Yager in the Arts Division," Barricelli added. "I am confident that he and I will be able to model a new SSC that builds on the fiscal success of this season, while together we remain uncompromising about SSC's continued artistic growth."  </p><p>Next up for Shakespeare Santa Cruz: Barricelli and award-winning UCSC theater arts professor Patty Gallagher will reprise a special dramatic reading of Mark Twain's <i>The Diaries of Adam and Eve</i>, October 16-17 at the Main Stage Theater on the UCSC campus.</p><p>"Shakespeare Santa Cruz can be held up as an example of a cherished program that was able to persevere with a combination of efficient operations and community support," noted UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p><p>"I commend and thank the patrons and friends of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, and the dedicated volunteers and staff who have worked tirelessly and creatively to achieve this wonderful success story."</p><p>For more information about Shakespeare Santa Cruz, go to: www.shakespearesantacruz.org. </p><p>Tickets for the October 16 and 17 performances of <i>The Diaries of Adam and Eve</i> may be purchased online at santacruztickets.com, or by calling the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.</p><p>				</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d576e8072704601a012ffbf772f74"><name>3284</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Electronic pay stations replacing parking meters</title><summary>TAPS is replacing campus parking meters with electronic pay stations, such as the one just installed at the East Field House. </summary><keywords>TAPS, parking pay stations</keywords><description>TAPS is replacing campus parking meters with electronic pay stations, such as the one just installed at the East Field House. </description><start-date>1255503600000</start-date><display-name>Electronic pay stations replacing...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3284</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3284</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339067701</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339067701</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/paystation.240.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/paystation.240.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>paystation.240.jpg</name><file-size>32514</file-size><width>240</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new parking paystation has been installed at the East Field House parking lot. Paystations offer more flexibility than meters because they accept coins, dollar bills, and credit cards. The cost remains $1.50 per hour, and there is still a two-hour limit. Meter fees are required from 8 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. The number of metered and permit spaces remains the same, but the placement of those spaces has changed somewhat.</p><p>To use the paystations, drivers should note the number of the parking stall where they've parked and enter it into the machine. Then, simply follow the on-screen instructions to pay for the permit, and place the permit on the driver's side dashboard of the car. Drivers should note that the machines are not able to provide change or refunds once money is inserted.</p><p>Paystations are already in operation in the Core West parking structure, Performing Arts, and Hahn Student Services parking lots. Because mechanical meters often become jammed, and are sometimes vandalized, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) anticipates replacing meters in as many as 20 locations over the next three years. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d59438072704601a012ffc7ad55b0"><name>3285</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Popular Science taps UCSC anthropologist Nathaniel Dominy for "Brilliant 10" issue</title><summary>&lt;i&gt;Popular Science&lt;/i&gt; names Nathaniel J.

Dominy one of this year's "Brilliant 10" young scientists and researchers.</p>
<p>Dominy, an associate professor of anthropology, is profiled in the November issue, on newsstands today (Oct. 15). It is the magazine's ninth annual <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2009-10/ten-young-geniuses-shaking-science-today">"Brilliant 10"</a> issue, which shines a spotlight on men and women under 40 whose work "will change the future." Winners were chosen from hundreds of nominees.</p>
<p>Dominy, 33, is a bold researcher who has already made significant contributions to the study of <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1631">human evolution</a>. His work focuses on the acquisition and consumption of food; his goal is to identify the nutritional jackpot that gave our forebears a major advantage over all other primates. To that end, he explores the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1553">diet</a> and foraging behaviors of hominins, the early human ancestors who lived 2 million years ago. A creative and indefatigable scientist, Dominy works at the intersection of anthropology, ecology, and genetics to understand what fueled the development of bipedalism and big brains.</p>
<p>Writing from Uganda, where he is on a research expedition, Dominy said it is an honor to be included among the "Brilliant 10," all of whom bring an "integrative" approach to their work.</p>
<p>"Many scientists carry a hammer, and for them the world is made of nails," wrote Dominy. "It is evident that each Brilliant 10 carries with them a diverse toolkit."</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal congratulated Dominy on being selected. "This honor will bring Professor Dominy's prodigious talent to the attention of a broad audience," said Blumenthal. "We at UCSC know that his dedication to research is matched by a deep commitment to teaching. He is a gifted teacher and a wonderful role model for aspiring scientists."</p>
<p>With more than 7 million readers each month, Popular Science (www.popsci.com) is the world's largest science and technology magazine.</p>
<p>The honor is the latest for Dominy, who in 2007 won a prestigious <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1643">Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering</a> from The David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p>
<p>Dominy is in Africa to launch a multiple-continent investigation of pygmy populations to study the biomechanics and metabolic costs of locomotion.</p>

<p>We commend and thank the patrons and friends of SSC and the dedicated volunteers and staff who have worked tirelessly and creatively to achieve this wonderful success story. This achievement is further noteworthy given the economy. Shakespeare Santa Cruz can be held up as an example of a cherished program that was able to persevere with a combination of efficient operations and community support.</p>
<p>Shakespeare Santa Cruz successfully reduced expenses and streamlined operations during the past year while also staging an outstanding season. Ticket sales were extremely strong despite the severe economic climate. These achievements and an outpouring of financial support last December will enable Shakespeare Santa Cruz to balance its current and upcoming season budgets.</p>
<p>Many people deserve credit for SSC's success this year-including Arts Division staff and faculty, development staff, the company itself, the community, everyone who bought tickets (including faculty and staff), and the many financial supporters from across the country, and as far away as Italy. The support from the community and beyond is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>In the coming year, the new business model and community support will enable SSC to maintain the high quality of performances and continue to integrate the company into the campus's core academic mission.</p>
<p>Professional theater companies within academic settings rarely can sustain themselves on ticket sales alone. They need strong community support and effective collaboration with their academic partners. We're committed to seeing SSC continue progressing in these directions in 2010.</p>
<p>As you receive this note, a media briefing is underway, and we expect a great deal of interest. You may check the campus <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events">News &amp; Events</a> site tomorrow for an update on media coverage.</p>

While the vast majority of adults recover within 5-7 days, there have been rare hospitalizations, and even deaths, from this infection in otherwise healthy college students.</p><p>We are taking steps to help prevent the spread of flu -- both seasonal and H1N1 -- at UCSC.  But we also want you to be informed, and take steps to protect yourself.</p><p>On the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/flu/article.asp?pid=2893">campus's Flu web site</a> we are posting information regularly that includes precautions recommended by public health officers and advice if you experience flu symptoms.</p><p>I encourage you to follow these five steps:</p><p><b>. Practice good hand hygiene by washing your hands frequently with soap and water</b> -- especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used when handwashing is not convenient.</p><p><b>. Practice respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</b>  If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow or shoulder, not your hands.</p><p><b>. Know the signs and symptoms of the flu.</b>  The flu is different from a typical cold; it usually begins abruptly and is associated with muscle aches, headache, chills and fever.  "Fever" is a temperature taken with a thermometer that is equal to or greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.  It is a good idea to obtain a thermometer before you are sick and need it.</p><p>Most college students who come down with the H1N1 flu will improve on the 3rd or 4th day with simple <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2009/09/influenza_self-care-guidelines.pdf">self care</a> that includes rest, over-the-counter fever reducers and pain relievers (ibuprofen or acetaminophen also known as advil, motrin or Tylenol), and fluids.  Students should voluntarily isolate in their rooms until they are free of fever for 24 hours (after discontinuing fever-controlling medication).  Rarely, otherwise-healthy college students with this infection will develop pneumonia.  In severe cases, hospitalization may be needed.  This quarter, two UCSC students living off-campus have been hospitalized with pneumonia from probable H1N1 influenza. Nationwide, there have been four deaths among college students attributed to the H1N1 influenza infection.</p><p><b>. Students with a flu-like illness who are feeling worse on the 3rd day of illness should seek medical evaluation.</b> Severe symptoms that warrant medical evaluation include shortness of breath, severe lightheadedness or dizziness, fever lasting more than 3 days or severe vomiting and the inability to hold down liquids.  Students who have asthma, diabetes or other conditions that may lower their immunity should seek medical evaluation if they develop a fever, even if their symptoms are not otherwise severe; they may benefit from early treatment with antiviral medicine.  It is typical for fever and body aches to resolve by the third day but congestion, sore throat and cough may persist 1-2 weeks.  Over-the-counter remedies can be used to control these symptoms as the infection is resolving.</p><p><b>. Please call the UCSC Student Influenza phone advice line (831-459-2591) if you are unsure if you need medical evaluation.</b>  Please also check the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/">Student Health Center web site</a> for after-hours information when the health center is closed in the evening and on weekends.</p><p>Thank you for your attention to this very important health issue.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>UCSC Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d5e978072704601a012ff93436f7b"><name>3288</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Flu: Public Service Announcement #1</title><start-date>1255071600000</start-date><display-name>Flu: Public Service Announcement...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3288</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3288</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339069525</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339069525</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>October 9, 2009</p><p>Contact: Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</p><p></p><p>30-SECOND PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p>Start:  Immediately</p><p>Stop:  When notified by UCSC Public Affairs</p><p><p style="line-height:1.8;">UCSC'S FLU RESOURCES WEB SITE - AT <b><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/flu/">WWW.UCSC.EDU/FLU</a></b> - CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF GETTING SEASONAL AND H1N1 FLU.

Akeson.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has awarded a $1.1 million grant to researchers in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz to support their work on nanopore technology for analyzing DNA.</p><p>Led by biomolecular engineers Mark Akeson and David Deamer, the UCSC nanopore group has pioneered a technology based on a tiny pore in a membrane, called a "nanopore" because it is just 1.5 nanometers wide at its narrowest point. The nanopore is formed by a self-assembling protein complex called an ion channel and is just big enough to allow a single strand of DNA to pass through. Researchers use the nanopore device to obtain precise measurements of DNA structure and dynamics as the molecule passes through the pore. </p><p>A primary goal of the project is to develop nanopore technology as a fast and inexpensive method for DNA sequencing. Medical diagnosis and treatment is being revolutionized by tools that enable doctors to quickly obtain detailed genetic information about their patients. That genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotide subunits in DNA molecules. Despite many advances in sequencing technology, however, DNA sequencing is still too expensive and time-consuming for routine clinical use. </p><p>Akeson, a professor of biomolecular engineering, said the UCSC nanopore group has made progress recently by coupling DNA-binding enzymes to the nanopore. DNA polymerases are enzymes involved in the replication of DNA in cells. When coupled to the nanopore, the enzymes control the movement of the DNA molecule through the pore. </p><p>"We are borrowing from nature, which has developed this molecular machinery to replicate DNA in cells," Akeson said. "The polymerase controls the rate at which the DNA is processed through the nanopore sensor, operating in the range of 1 to 100 milliseconds per nucleotide. It also regulates the distance the DNA molecule moves, so that it advances one nucleotide at a time."</p><p>In the work funded by the NHGRI grant, the researchers are focusing on experiments to measure the effects of voltage and other variables on how efficiently the nanopore system can control and process long DNA molecules (up to 2,500 nucleotides in length). The new grant was funded through the economic stimulus bill (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). </p><p>Since its beginnings in 1996, the UCSC nanopore project has grown into a large collaborative effort within the Baskin School of Engineering. In addition to Akeson and Deamer, a research professor of biomolecular engineering, the group now includes William Dunbar, assistant professor of computer engineering; Hongyun Wang, professor of applied math and statistics; and senior investigators Kate Lieberman, Felix Olasagasti, and Robin Abu-Shumays. Graduate students Noah Wilson, Daniel Garalde, and Nick Hurt are also associated with the nanopore group, as are six undergraduates. </p><p>"Some of the most promising work we do is coming from the undergrads in our lab," Akeson said. "One of our laboratories and four of our state-of-the-art nanopore devices are currently devoted to experiments by these students." </p><p>The nanopore technology developed at UCSC has been licensed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies of Oxford, U.K., which is developing nanopore technology for DNA sequencing and other potential applications. The UCSC Office for Management of Intellectual Property was instrumental in negotiating a favorable agreement with the company, Akeson said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d62d88072704601a012ffe2bdf82c"><name>3291</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>High-wind warning has expired</title><summary>The High Wind Warning for the Santa Cruz area issued by the National Weather Service has expired.

Photo by J. McNulty.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sol Lipman is a fun-loving guy. If you hear "high-tech entrepreneur" and think "boring," think again. Instead, think skateboards, summer camp, and pet chickens.</p><p>Because fun is what it's all about, says Lipman, founder of <a href="http://12seconds.tv/">12seconds.tv</a>, a web service that has popularized 12-second "video tweets" that users post to Facebook and Twitter. Why just 12 seconds?</p><p>"We figured people make videos to be seen by their friends, and anything is interesting for 12 seconds," says Lipman.</p><p>Although celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal and Imogen Heap have embraced 12seconds.tv, Lipman's real focus is on "building community," something he's  pursued since college, when he spent two years as an RA in the dorms at Stevenson. </p><p>"Our goal was to have the coolest dorms ever," recalls Lipman during an interview at the company's offices in downtown Santa Cruz. "We had something every week. Being an RA is still my favorite job of all time." </p><p>Which is saying a lot from a guy who loved being a summer-camp counselor so much that he once took a detour off the high-tech highway to direct a summer camp. Whether in the dorms, as a founding member of the Stevenson Theater Guild, or in business, Lipman enjoys "being surrounded by great people who want to do good things."</p><p>"I was the capitalist at UCSC," says Lipman, who graduated in 1995 with a degree in politics. "Everyone else wanted to protest that we couldn't be in a play because we weren't Theater Arts majors, and I said, 'Screw that, we'll just go and make our own theater troupe.' Whenever things don't go your way, there's an opportunity there. That's always true."</p><p>Although a self-described "gadget person," Lipman says his interest in business drew him to Silicon Valley. His first Internet venture was a web development firm with Brant Smith, a former chair of the Student Union Assembly at UCSC. "That was so early, everything was wide open. We nailed it--we had big clients, like Hewlett Packard and Epson," he explained. "I learned a lot."</p><p>That success bankrolled his involvement with one of the first social networking sites, which he describes as "scarily similar to MySpace but ahead of its time." The site, called thedigs.com, was acquired by IDrive during the dot-com boom. When the boom ended, Lipman decided he "really just wanted to be a camp director" and moved to Malibu. But "somewhere along the way," he was lured back into business, and he earned an M.B.A. from the University of Washington. </p><p>"I was surrounded by executives from Boeing and Microsoft," Lipman says of graduate school. "I was shocked they let me in, actually. I think I was their token nonprofit (director)." </p><p>When he was ready to settle down, the decision to return to Santa Cruz was a no-brainer: "Santa Cruz has got it all: amazing people, the beach, the mountains, and it's close enough to Silicon Valley to do another start-up."</p><p>Which he did. Until it was acquired. And he found himself driving over the hill every day. Which got him thinking about what that commute over winding Highway 17 meant to his lifestyle.</p><p>"Twenty-five thousand people commute every day from Santa Cruz to tech jobs over the hill," says Lipman. "Santa Cruz is a bedroom community for Google and Yahoo and Intel."</p><p>Certain they weren't the only people disillusioned by the commute, Lipman and a friend organized "geek dinners" to talk about ways to develop local jobs. At the same time, city officials were talking about developing a co-working space in Santa Cruz. In October 2008, <a href="http://nextspace.us/">NextSpace</a> was established. The hip, second-story space above a surf shop at the busy intersection of Pacific Avenue and Cooper Street in downtown Santa Cruz serves as a home base for 140 members, including businesses like 12seconds.tv, as well as independent contractors working in technology, design, public relations, architecture, law, and other fields. Options range from carrels where members can plug in a laptop to full-fledged office suites--and the café is always busy, says Lipman.</p><p>"It's exactly the same dynamic as a dorm," he says. "It gets people out of their bedroom offices so they can come together and collaborate. It's a dorm for professionals."</p><p>The success of NextSpace--open just a year, the facility is already maxed out--illustrates the pent-up demand for professional community in Santa Cruz, says Lipman. "It's all just a big lovefest, really," he says with a grin.</p><p>Ironically, 12seconds.tv will likely outgrow its space, especially if <a href="http://12seconds.tv/12mail">12mail</a>, a new iPhone app, takes off. "That would be a sad day for us," concedes Lipman, who quickly adds: "But it'd be just like college. Eventually we had to leave."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d6c2c8072704601a012ff4728c832"><name>3297</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cyber security month tip, week 3: Keep your passwords secure</title><summary>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month.

This week's cyber security "tip of the week" from ITS focuses on password security.</p>
<p>Your password is often the first line of defense against hackers and unauthorized access to your computer and accounts. Always use good, hard-to-guess passwords and keep your passwords secret.</p>
<p>What is a good, hard-to-guess password?</p>

<ul>
<li>Passwords should be at least eight characters long with a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords that can't be this complex should be at least 10 characters long. 


</li>
<li>Don't use a word found in the dictionary in any language, spelled forward or backward, or a word preceded or followed by a digit (e.g., password1, 1password). 


</li>
<li>Avoid common keyboard sequences, such as "qwerty789" or "abc123." 


</li>
<li>Don't use your login name or personal information that someone could know or find out about you, such as names of family, places, pets, birthdays, address, your car model, etc. 


</li>
<li>Avoid writing passwords down. If you have to write a password down, store it securely--not on your monitor, under your keyboard, in your top desk drawer, or in a file labeled "passwords." 


</li>
<li>Always change initial passwords, password resets, and default passwords the first time you log in. These passwords can be extra vulnerable. 


</li>
<li>Don't let your applications or browser remember passwords that provide access to sensitive systems or data. That way if someone gets into your computer they don't also automatically get into all of your accounts.</li>
</ul>

This followed a party in the Social Sciences/Humanities courtyard, which elicited numerous noise complaints from students in nearby College residences.</p><p>Staff observed a trash dumpster and large landscape rocks being moved to the middle of Hagar Drive, impeding buses and other traffic. Three people carrying a large table near the entrance to the Humanities Building - apparently intending to vandalize or blockade the building - cursed at an officer and defied multiple requests to stop. Pepper spray was used to subdue them. One of the three was arrested; the others fled on foot.</p><p>Campus cleanup crews this morning began removing graffiti from Humanities 2, an adjacent restroom, Bay Tree Bookstore, and Cowell and Stevenson Colleges. Staff were also working to clear dumpsters and broken picnic tables from exterior stairwells in Humanities 2. When added to cleanup costs following the earlier occupation of the Graduate Student Commons, these efforts will run into tens of thousands of dollars - costs directly borne by taxpayers, students and their families. Those dollars are diverted from educating and supporting students.</p><p>The two "occupations" of campus buildings since the beginning of fall quarter appear to be related to dissatisfaction with UC funding and related budget issues. It seems incongruous, if not absurd, that people declaring UC to be "their university" would deface campus buildings and deny access to spaces used by and for students, faculty, staff and campus guests.</p><p>Cordially,</p><p>Dave Kliger</p><p>Executive Vice Chancellor and Campus Provost</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>EVC/Campus Provost Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d70698072704601a012fff8b72c25"><name>3300</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Sociologist Craig Reinarman's expertise on drug policy was featured in a &lt;b&gt;Newsweek&lt;/b&gt; story about the growing movement to legalize marijuana. </summary><description>Sociologist Craig Reinarman's expertise on drug policy was featured in a &lt;b&gt;Newsweek&lt;/b&gt; story about the growing movement to legalize marijuana. </description><start-date>1255676400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3300</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3300</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339074087</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339074087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sociologist Craig Reinarman's expertise on drug policy was featured in a <strong><em>Newsweek</em></strong> story about the growing movement to legalize marijuana.</p>

<p>Applications are now being accepted through January 15 for the inaugural class, beginning in fall quarter of 2010.</p>
<p>Focusing on cinema, television, video art, and Internet-based media, the new doctoral program will challenge the traditional borders between creative practice and critical studies.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, the study of media is converging with the production of media," noted UCSC film and digital media professor Warren Sack, director of graduate studies for the department. "For example, scholars are now producing films, web sites, and 3-D models, and media producers are studying history, theory and criticism to create something new and different. We are creating a new Ph.D. program that will integrate both media scholarship and production."</p>
<p>Sack added that UCSC's new Ph.D. program is designed to provide a platform for the creation of hybrid work that would be difficult to accomplish in other academic settings.</p>
<p>He stressed that candidates for the program must have demonstrated skill in critical, theoretical, and historical scholarship, and a demonstrated interest in film, television, video, or new media production.</p>
<p>"We hope to attract seasoned artists whose work has moved them to dig more deeply into the history, theory, and criticism of their medium," said Sack. "And, we are equally welcoming of media scholars whose writings have broadened to incorporate multiple media of expression."</p>
<p>Larry Andrews, chair of the UCSC Film and Digital Media Department noted that faculty are excited about the increased research energy that the presence of graduate students will bring to the department.</p>
<p>"The film program is now entering a moment when we will soon be celebrating our 10-year anniversary, and it is fitting that at this point in time we should be launching a new graduate program, marking a new phase for the department," said Andrews.</p>
<p>"Our program, although relatively young, is beginning to see the mark that our undergraduates are making on the world," Andrews added. "It will be incredibly exciting to see the same thing happen with our future grad students."</p>

Loik, associate professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.  </p><p>Many scientists have concluded that human-induced global climate change is rapidly emerging as one of the most important societal concerns of the 21st century. They have made considerable progress in understanding how ecosystems will be affected by factors such as rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and warming. Yet less is known about how those systems will respond to related changes in rain and snowfall.   </p><p>Scientists have initiated an increasing number of manipulative precipitation experiments throughout the world over the past two decades. The goal is to understand whether changes in precipitation patterns are tied in with the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems.  </p><p>"Our understanding of the linkages between factors such as widespread drought, a changing climate and the dynamics of our landscapes is growing, but we need a broader perspective that includes the many different ecosystems of the globe," said Travis E. Huxman, director of UA Biosphere 2.  </p><p>One example of this is the widespread die-back of trees throughout North America. This results from many complex interactions between drought, insect outbreaks and changes in fire cycle dynamics. </p><p>"Biosphere 2 provides the ideal platform from which to launch an effort that interfaces human and natural systems. It is a natural fit with our mission," added Huxman.</p><p>Scientists at the meeting will be conducting a sophisticated statistical comparison of more than 50 experiments in natural settings ranging from the southwestern United States, to Europe, Israel, China, Australia, and even Antarctica.  </p><p>"As public concern heightens over the impacts of global climate change, an urgent need exists for a sound scientific basis on which to formulate policies regulating greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous interference with the Earth's climate system," said Lindsey Rustad of the U. S. Forest Service. </p><p>"The synthesis products that result from this international collaboration will inform and guide policy makers in their negotiations concerning adaptation and mitigation measures, such as those to be debated at the upcoming UN Framework Convention on Climate Change occurring in Copenhagen this December," said Claus Beier of the Technical University of Denmark.  </p><p>The meeting was funded in part by the National Science Foundation of the United States.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d80e48072704601a012ff7b12b963"><name>3309</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers to study hidden lakes beneath West Antarctic ice sheet</title><summary>UCSC researchers will drill through a half-mile of ice to penetrate subglacial Lake Whillans and study hidden processes that govern the dynamics of the West Antarctic ice sheet.</summary><author>Daniel Strain (831) 459-2495; dstrain@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Slawek Tulaczyk, WISSARD, WAIS, West Antarctic ice sheet, ice streams</keywords><description>UCSC researchers will drill through a half-mile of ice to penetrate subglacial Lake Whillans and study hidden processes that govern the dynamics of the West Antarctic ice sheet.</description><start-date>1256108400000</start-date><display-name>Researchers to study hidden...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3309</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3309</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339078289</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339078289</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Daniel Strain</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>dstrain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/slawek_crop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/slawek_crop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slawek_crop.jpg</name><file-size>58165</file-size><width>312</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Slawek Tulaczyk has been studying the West Antarctic ice sheet for more than a decade.

The project's multidisciplinary team of researchers from nine U.S. institutions includes Slawek Tulaczyk and Andrew Fisher, both professors of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p><p>Tulaczyk, a glaciologist who has been studying the West Antarctic ice sheet for more than a decade, is one of three co-leaders who will oversee different parts of the complex project. In 2002, he organized a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/09-30/drilling.html">workshop</a> at UCSC to explore the technologies needed to drill through the Antarctic ice sheet. </p><p>"If you want to understand how fast the ice moves and how it contributes to sea level changes, you have to understand how subglacial lakes influence that motion," Tulaczyk said.</p><p>Estimates for the rise in sea level that would result from a complete collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) range from 10 to 16 feet. The WAIS is considered less stable than the larger East Antarctic ice sheet because much of it rests below sea level, making it more susceptible to melting by warm ocean currents and rapid calving of icebergs. </p><p>Coursing through the ice sheet are fast-moving sections called ice streams. "They are just like rivers of ice," Tulaczyk said. "The contribution of ice to sea level is dependent on the difference between how much snow is coming into the ice sheet and how much ice is coming out. How fast the ice streams move and whether their velocity can change is important to understanding how fast sea level will rise."</p><p>Liquid water at the base of the ice streams is thought to be a key factor controlling their movement. Research by Tulaczyk and others has revealed networks of subglacial lakes beneath the ice that may have substantial effects on the dynamics of the ice sheets.  </p><p>How the lakes form beneath a half-mile of ice remains a mystery, but scientists believe that geothermal energy plays a critical role, heating the ice from below. According to Fisher, however, a lack of hard data has hampered efforts to develop predictive models of this process.</p><p>"After several decades of intense Antarctic study, there have been very few studies of the geothermal energy coming in to the base of the ice," he said. </p><p>Subglacial lakes are under extreme pressure from the expanses of ice above. When the pressure in a lake builds high enough, it begins to drain, and water flows to another pocket in the ice where the pressure is lower. </p><p>Although subglacial lakes may be covered by thousands of feet of ice, these filling and flooding events can be detected on the surface. Tulaczyk and his colleagues have monitored lake activity by measuring the changes in ice sheet elevations with GPS and satellite data. They measured changes in elevation of up to 10 meters (33 feet), which they attributed to movements of subglacial water. </p><p>With the new NSF funding, Tulaczyk will be able to use new technology to develop a more complete picture of subglacial hydrology. UCSC's share of the grant, provided through the federal economic stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act), is $2.1 million.</p><p>In the 2012-13 field season, Tulaczyk, as acting WISSARD program leader, will lead a team to the Whillans Ice Stream on the WAIS. There, researchers will drill through more than 2,300 feet of ice to subglacial Lake Whillans.</p><p>With access to the lake, Tulaczyk and his team will use sensors to measure changes in water pressure and other variables. These measurements will provide details on how often and to what degree the lake fills and floods. The team will record video from within the lake to monitor the activity of the surrounding ice. Researchers will also recover sediment cores to enable reconstruction of the long-term history of Lake Whillans and its effects on the ice stream.</p><p>For his part, Fisher is modifying a probe initially designed to measure geothermal energy on the ocean floor. The probe will be six to eight feet long and contain a network of sensors. When forced into the sediment below Lake Whillans, the sensors will provide the first detailed measurements of geothermal activity beneath the Antarctic ice sheets.</p><p>Fisher, who will travel to Antarctica to test the probe in WISSARD's first field season (2010-11), said he hopes these data will help glaciologists create more accurate models of polar melting. "By collecting these measurements, we reduce one more uncertainty in the ice dynamics," he said. "It's an important piece of the puzzle."</p><p>But WISSARD scientists, who will be the first visitors to Lake Whillans in over a million years, are interested in more than the dynamics of ice and water. Recent research has suggested that subglacial lakes may be home to unique microbial communities. </p><p>"Even though the life will probably be very simple, it has managed to exist in total isolation from the atmosphere and sunlight for millions of years," Tulaczyk said.</p><p>The researchers will have to take extra precautions to avoid contaminating the subglacial environment with their equipment, so they are currently designing specialized sterile-drilling equipment. The drill will use hot water to melt through the ice. To eliminate bacterial hitchhikers, the water will first be passed through an ultrathin filter and exposed to lethal doses of ultraviolet light.</p><p>"That's part of what makes this technologically new and challenging," said Tulaczyk. "We have to be able to open that hole all the way to the bed, but have everything that goes in be very clean."</p><p>Another component of WISSARD will focus on the boundary between the ice sheet and the ocean. At its margins, the ice sheet extends out over the sea in massive floating ice shelves. Colleagues from Northern Illinois University and New York University will use Tulaczyk's drilling technology to lower a 24-foot-long robotic submarine into the dark waters beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. </p><p>The robotic submarine will record the first images ever taken of the grounding zone, a critical transition point where the floating ice shelf contacts the seafloor. For the first time, Tulaczyk will have a subglacial view of the Whillans Ice Stream where it feeds into the Ross Ice Shelf. </p><p>Recordings by the submarine will provide valuable information regarding the ice stream's velocity. The submarine will also measure the processes that are eating away at the base of the WAIS. </p><p>The WISSARD project will give scientists much needed data for evaluating the stability of the WAIS and making predictions about future changes in sea level. "Important decisions that will have social and economic impacts will be based on this research," Tulaczyk said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d82bc8072704601a012ff55135ba8"><name>3310</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Friends group to unveil National Register of Historic Places plaque </title><summary>A permanent National Register of Historic Places plaque will be placed near the Cook House to recognize the campus's historic lime-producing district.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><description>A permanent National Register of Historic Places plaque will be placed near the Cook House to recognize the campus's historic lime-producing district.</description><start-date>1256108400000</start-date><display-name>Friends group to unveil...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3310</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3310</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339078789</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339078789</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/subocz.david.plaque.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/subocz.david.plaque.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>subocz.david.plaque.300.jpg</name><file-size>51263</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District board member David Subocz after intstalling the plaque in the limestone boulder selected as the base.

<p>UC Santa Cruz is the only institution of higher education in California that has an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, according to Joe Michalak, vice president of the Friends group and former head of Reference Services at UCSC.</p>
<p>Securing designation of the district as a National Historic Place is the culmination of many years of effort by area historians and the campus to recognize its historical significance to the region, the state, and the nation.</p>
<p>The historic district is an area of about 30 acres around the main entrance of the campus on either side of Coolidge Drive. The district includes historic buildings and lime production features and related support facilities that date to the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>The UCSC campus was established on lands that once were part of the Cowell Ranch. Henry Cowell, a major industrialist in central California, operated a large complex of industrial lime production and support facilities scattered throughout what are now campus lands. His local holdings also extended widely into surrounding areas. Lime, which was produced at the campus site by burning limestone in large redwood-fired kilns, was critical in the manufacture of mortar, plaster, and whitewash, and also was used in a number of other industries.</p>
<p>The complex of historic buildings and features that have been included in the campus's historic district are of particular historic value because they represent the full range of facilities needed in a historic rural industrial operation, including both lime-processing facilities and also ranch and worker-support buildings.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, in December 2007 the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the nation's official list of significant cultural resources worthy of preservation. The historic district includes the Granary, now a childcare center; the Cook House, now the Admissions office; several barns; the Cooperage, where barrels for lime shipping were made; the ruins of former workers' cabins; the Blacksmith Shop; Cardiff House, now the Women's Center but formerly the residence of lime works owner Henry Cowell; and the lime kilns themselves.</p>
<p>The district is important in the history of economic and physical development of the Monterey Bay region and, as the largest center of lime making in Northern California at peak production in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it is significant in the history and development of the state from the Gold Rush through the early years of the 20th century.</p>

The final cyber security month "tip of the week" from ITS focuses on cyber security for people who work remotely.</p>
<p>Cyber security is especially important for people who work remotely. Here are a few tips to help protect information when you're "out and about":</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't store <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security/policies/glossary.php#rd">restricted data</a> or passwords on mobile devices, including laptops. 


</li>
<li>Make sure you have a secure connection before working with restricted data. If you're not sure, assume it's not secure. Keep in mind that most coffeeshop/hotel/airport-type wireless is not encrypted. 


</li>
<li>You can tell your connection is secure if: 

<p>- You are using a known, encrypted network. UCSC is offering a more secure campus wireless service called CruzNet Secure to UCSC faculty, staff, and graduate students this November--keep an eye out for an announcement soon.</p>
<p>- You are only working on Web pages that have https (not http) in the Web address (URL). The "s" stands for "secure" and tells you that the information you enter is being encrypted. Most Web browsers also have a little locked padlock that appears in the nav bar or a corner of the browser window to indicate that information is being encrypted. Look for both of these indicators before logging into anything.</p>

</li>
<li>Set your devices to "ask" before joining networks so you don't unknowingly connect to insecure wireless networks. 


</li>
<li>Don't work with restricted data from a non-university computer unless you can ensure the computer meets UCSC's security requirements.</li>
</ul>

She was 96.</p><p>Dougherty, a founding fellow of Merrill College and one of its first Resident Preceptors, began her career at UCSC in 1967. She was the first chair of the UCSC interdisciplinary East Asian Studies committee. Dougherty also served as Chair of the Faculty at Merrill. Following a reorganization in 1979, she was a Cowell fellow before retirement in 1981.</p><p>While at UCSC, Dougherty gained a reputation among her peers as a pioneer by teaching the pinyin romanization system and simplified Chinese characters adopted by the People's Republic of China, rather than Wade-Giles romanization and complex characters still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. More than a decade passed before most other Chinese language programs followed Dougherty's lead. Dougherty also led in the introduction and regular use of Chinese characters beginning with the first lesson, a practice hitherto thought too difficult for beginning students but now widely adopted.</p><p>As Marlowe Hood, a former student who later provided the world with the first on-the-scene reports of the 1989 Tian An Men Incident, wrote when Dougherty was awarded the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teacher of the Year Award in 1981:</p><p><blockquote>"Mrs. Dougherty's contribution to education is multi-faceted.  She has devised her own system of Chinese instruction for the first and second year levels.  Familiar with the methods used in most other institutions, I find hers superior.  She encourages competence in both simplified and complex characters.  Her grammatical and syntactical formulas-which at first seemed overly structured to me-have made it possible to decipher the rather stylized writings of Mainland and Taiwan publications alike. Mrs. Dougherty is, in short, widely recognized for her original contribution to teaching method and for the consistent high caliber of her students.  Most remarkably, the entire Chinese program at UCSC has been conceived, created and executed by her alone."</blockquote></p><p>Living on campus among students throughout her career, Dougherty was known as an easily approachable mentor. While modestly claiming no special skills for herself, Dougherty took great pride in the disproportionate number of prestigious fellowships and awards her long-time students obtained during her career. A remarkable number of Dougherty's students went on to their own distinguished careers in Chinese language and literature or related fields, including UCSC Professor of Literature Christopher Connery.</p><p>Dougherty was born in 1913 in Beijing, China.  She received her undergraduate degree in education from prestigious Yenching University, later made part of Peking University.  Her father, one of China's first western-educated dentists, did not approve of her attending a coeducational college, and wanted her to attend an all-women teacher's college instead. Demonstrating the self-reliance evident throughout her long life, Dougherty arranged her own intensive preparation program, quietly followed it, and sat for the difficult entrance exam. For the rest of her life, Dougherty treasured the look of astonishment and then pride upon her father's face when one morning, while perusing the newspaper, he glanced at the exam results and found, at the very top of the list of successful candidates, his own daughter's name.</p><p>She arrived in the United States in 1938 to do graduate work at Mills College in Oakland, California, as the Japanese occupation of northern China had disrupted her studies there. While attending Mills and living at International House in Berkeley, she met her future husband, Ellsworth C. Dougherty, who had graduated from Berkeley with an AB in Zoology in 1939 at age 18, and was then working on his PhD in Biology (awarded 1944). He would go on to get his MD degree at age 25. In 1944, the couple was forced to go to Seattle, Washington to marry because California still had anti-miscegenation laws. This attracted some press attention both within the United States and without. The Japanese repeated the story in China as proof that Americans did not view Chinese as equals. Dougherty's husband, Ellsworth, was considered a visionary and prolific researcher in comparative biology before his untimely death in 1965.</p><p>In the 1940's, during World War II, she taught the Chinese language to American servicemen on their way to the Pacific theater. After the war ended, Dougherty taught Mandarin at the Department of Oriental Languages at UC Berkeley until the birth of her son, Brian.  In the 1950's, Dougherty operated a small retail business in Berkeley.  From 1960 until her arrival at UCSC, Dougherty was an instrumental part of the Berkeley Chinese-English Machine Translation Project. At the time, the computer input of Chinese characters was a cumbersome process, requiring the operator to recall almost 10,000 different telegraphic codes for individual characters. The team developed a system allowing computer operators to vastly improve accessibility and efficiency. Dougherty also made major contributions in syntactic coding for word combinations and the writing of Chinese recognition grammar for machine translation. Dougherty, together with Sydney M. Lamb, and Samuel E. Martin, co-edited Chinese Character Indexes.</p><p>In her fourteen years at UCSC, she shaped the lives and careers of generations of UCSC students, and is remembered with special fondness by UCSC faculty, staff, and alumni.</p><p>Ching-yi Hsu Dougherty is survived by her son Brian, daughter-in-law Phyllis, and grandchildren Adam and Adriana.</p><p><i>Special thanks to RW Rogers, UCSC alumnus and former student of Ching-yi Dougherty, for this obituary notice.</i></p><p> </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Georges Van Den Abbeele, Dean of Humanities</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d90318072704601a012ff6ec06cb5"><name>3318</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Participation in E-Verify </title><start-date>1256626800000</start-date><display-name>Campus Participation in E-Verify...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3318</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3318</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339082223</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339082223</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a federal contractor, UCSC and other institutions of higher learning are now required to verify the work status of certain new and existing employees using the E-Verify system.</p><p>This new part of the campus employment verification process will ONLY affect employees who work directly on a federal contract or subcontract that requires the use of E-Verify.

Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) and Zimride have partnered to provide a UCSC-specific rideshare program that makes it easy to share the seats in your car or catch a ride with fellow UCSC colleagues.</p><p>It's simple. If you have a car, you can split the costs by driving with campus commuters. If you don't have a car, or choose not to use it, you can use Zimride to find a commute partner. With Zimride you can check out the profiles of your colleagues before you share the ride.</p><p>Ridesharing reduces campus traffic and parking impacts, and substantially reduces your carbon footprint. It also saves you money; even if you're only commuting ten miles each way, carpooling can save you over $100 a month. A carpool of 2 or more qualifies you to purchase a discounted Carpool Parking Permit and allows access to close-in parking and discounted daily parking permits.</p><p>To add your ride offer or request, go to <a href="http://zimride.ucsc.edu">http://zimride.ucsc.edu</a> -make sure you use your ucsc.edu email address. Add your daily commute before November 30th and be entered to win a $50 gas card.</p><p>For more information about the carpool parking program, visit the TAPS website at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/carpoolinformation.html">http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/carpoolinformation.html</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d957d8072704601a012ff771fa01d"><name>3321</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founders Day Dinner honors outstanding contributions to society</title><summary>The gala Founders Day Dinner was a sell-out as nearly 400 guests celebrated the theme of "Fulfilling the Promise" of UCSC's founders more than four decades ago.</summary><author>Guy Lasnier (831) 459-2955; lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Founders Day, Ed Catmull, Pixar, rebele</keywords><description>The gala Founders Day Dinner was a sell-out as nearly 400 guests celebrated the theme of "Fulfilling the Promise" of UCSC's founders more than four decades ago.</description><start-date>1256540400000</start-date><display-name>Founders Day Dinner honors...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3321</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3321</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339083560</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339083560</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/grb.rebeles.founders.day.2009.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/grb.rebeles.founders.day.2009.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grb.rebeles.founders.day.2009.300.jpg</name><file-size>17619</file-size><width>300</width><height>219</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Photo by Ryan Vaughn</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/10/images/catmull.ed.founders.day.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/10/images/catmull.ed.founders.day.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>catmull.ed.founders.day.300.jpg</name><file-size>13932</file-size><width>300</width><height>219</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Chancellor Blumenthal (in top photo) presents the Fiat Lux award to longtime UC Santa Cruz supporters Roland and Pat Rebele at the third annual <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3218">Founders Day Dinner</a>, Friday, October 23 at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz.</p>

Finkelstein estimated that as much as seven percent of new offspring die each year from lead poisoning on Midway's Sand Island. If this trend continues, albatross populations may decline by 16 percent over the next 50 years, she said.</p><p>The largest threat to Laysan albatross populations, however, isn't lead poisoning but the long-line fishing industry. Large numbers of adult albatross attracted to trails of bait behind fishing boats end up snagged on the hooks and drowned.</p><p>The number of albatross claimed by fisheries "bycatch" is hard to pin down. But the impacts are severe, and efforts to reform the fishing industry have met with consistent setbacks. According to Finkelstein, the most effective conservation strategy would incorporate both fishing reforms and lead-paint cleanup.</p><p>In 2003, Finkelstein identified the source of lead poisoning on Sand Island: 95 decaying buildings covered in lead-based paints. Chicks eat the paint chips that blow or fall into their nests. Finkelstein has even observed chicks eating peeling paint directly from the buildings.</p><p>The most visible symptom of lead poisoning in chicks, called "droopwing," is an inability to lift their wings as a result of the toxic effects of lead on the nervous system. Chicks with droopwing are never able to fly and eventually die from starvation or complications of lead poisoning. Even less severely affected chicks often have symptoms that keep them from surviving to adulthood.</p><p>About 50 percent of the world's 2.5 million Laysan albatross come to Sand Island annually to breed. Finkelstein surveyed the condition of chicks and the proximity of nests to contaminated buildings to evaluate the effects of lead poisoning on the Laysan albatross population.</p><p>According to Finkelstein's model, the removal of lead paint from the island today could increase the Laysan albatross population size by about 100,000 birds within 25 years. Without a comprehensive cleanup, the problem is likely to get worse, leading to an increase in the number of chicks dying from lead poisoning, Finkelstein said.</p><p>Long-lived and slow-to-reproduce species, like albatross, depend more on the survival of reproductive-aged adults than on the survival of newborns. If offspring die young, adults can try again the following year. In such species, protecting adults can have a bigger impact on the overall population size than protecting young.</p><p>But Finkelstein believes that relying on this approach can leave many conservation opportunities underutilized. "Most, if not all, vulnerable species have a multitude of human-mediated factors threatening their survival, not just one," she said.</p><p>In the case of the albatross, long-line fishery reforms are crucial. But lead paint removal could buffer the population while policy makers work to reform fishing practices. This cleanup is relatively inexpensive and could begin as soon as additional funds become available, said Finkelstein. </p><p>"Instead of just saying which threat is worse, you can also ask which one can we fix today," she said. "Which one is easier to fix to buy us time?"</p><p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has spent $1.5 million on lead-paint cleanup on the Midway Atoll since 2005, according to John Klavitter, deputy refuge manager and a coauthor of the study.</p><p>Due to funding limitations, the USFWS is only able to clean or remove 10 buildings per year and has fixed 24 of the 95 buildings to date. It will cost an additional $4.1 million to treat the remaining structures, a sum that does not include sand cleanup, said Klavitter. </p><p>In recent years, both nature and history enthusiasts have flocked to the Midway Atoll in greater numbers. It is now part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument established in 2006. Finkelstein said she is concerned that if Sand Island's buildings continue to degrade, lead paint will become a threat to other animal species and to human visitors. </p><p>"It's such a beautiful place and it has such a historical significance for us as a nation," she said. "I think we should put forward the resources to make it this really amazing place that our kids and grandkids can visit to see the albatross."</p><p>In addition to Finkelstein and Klavitter, the coauthors of the study include Dan Doak of the University of Wyoming; Melinda Nakagawa of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; and Paul Sievert of the U.S. Geological Survey.</p><p>Funding was provided by the David H. Smith Postdoctoral Fellowship and the Switzer Environmental Leadership Grant.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d98ed8072704601a012ffe8000e54"><name>3323</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Archaeology course unlocks "silent history" of the slave trade in West Africa</title><summary>Anthropologist J.

"It was an 8 a.m. class, but it ended up being my favorite. I realized this is what I want to do forever."</p><p>Taught by assistant professor of anthropology J. Cameron Monroe, the class opened a door that led Baker-Rabe to West Africa, where she spent seven weeks this past summer as part of UCSC's first undergraduate archaeological expedition to Benin. </p><p>Under Monroe's leadership, Baker-Rabe and seven other undergraduates spent nearly two months unearthing beads, bits of pottery, and other artifacts that yield clues to the everyday lives of Africans during the 18th  and 19th centuries. Galvanized by the experience, she now plans to apply to graduate school and pursue a Ph.D. in archaeology.</p><p>"I was pretty excited to find my first sherd of ceramic, and about three weeks into the dig, I found a blue bead," recalled Baker-Rabe, now a senior. Lessons from the class flooded back to her as the team uncovered fragments of tobacco pipes, glass bottles, European porcelain, ironware, and ritual items.</p><p>Artifacts, oral histories, and scant documentary evidence are all that remain of the precolonial history of the kingdom of Dahomey (pronounced DAH-hoe-may) in the southern portion of the Republic of Benin. The region is of great historical significance because approximately 20 percent of all enslaved Africans bound for the New World passed through the area, according to Monroe.</p><p>Much of what is known about the region is based on documents related to the transatlantic slave trade, including shipping records, account books, and the diaries of European slave traders, merchants, and missionaries. But there is very little evidence of what communities were like in the West African interior.</p><p>Archaeology can shed light on this lost history, said Monroe, who is tracing evidence of past settlements to learn how villagers interacted, traded, and moved between the coast, cities, and the countryside.</p><p>"It was a tense and terrifying time for people" as slave raiders swept up tens of thousands of Africans and displaced many more, said Monroe, whose work is contributing to the understanding of how Africans coped with the pressures of the slave trade. </p><p>"The village of Cana, where we're working, has a deep history of migration and immigration from distance regions," he said. "It became a heterogeneous, diverse community. Like Los Angeles in the 20th century, nobody was from there." </p><p>Since 2000, Monroe has focused his research on excavating former palace sites and remnants of villages in an effort to assemble evidence of what buildings looked like, how goods flowed, and even what rituals were performed.</p><p>"When times get tough, people get creative--about networks, the exchange of goods, and moving to safe areas," said Monroe. "Beads can say enormous things about what sorts of connections people were making."</p><p>In the field this summer, Monroe shared his passion for unlocking this "silent history" with an international team of students from four countries, including Benin. Monroe is the director of the UC Abomey Plateau Archaeological Project, which sponsored the expedition in collaboration with the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. </p><p>The trip marked the first archaeological dig for each participant, including Baker-Rabe.  </p><p>"Having that access to Cameron was really amazing," she said. "The history he's finding has never been recorded. No one would ever know."</p><p>The work was physically taxing: Participants rose at dawn and worked eight hours a day in the tropical sun, excavating deep pits with picks and hoes, hauling buckets of dirt, and cleaning and analyzing hundreds of artifacts. </p><p>"The first week, I was really sore," said Baker-Rabe, pointing to the well-defined "troweling muscles" of her right forearm. "I was tired and sore and sunburned, and I got malaria. It wasn't easy, but I was still happy."</p><p>The shared experience of working hard and learning together was deeply satisfying, and the pace of life slowed enough that Baker-Rabe said she was able to think deeply about her future. "We talked about graduate school, letters of recommendation, and different fields of archaeology," she recalled. "I had the time and the silence to think about these things critically and in terms of who I want to be." </p><p>Baker-Rabe still thinks about the trip every day. And she still gets her hands in the dirt every week as part of a class excavating the Cowell Lime Works Historic District at the base of campus. </p><p>For Monroe, the expedition advanced a pressing research agenda. The team spent several weeks excavating rural sites he discovered in 2007. Upon closer examination, two sites appear to have been quarries where iron-rich, pebbly earth was removed, probably for use in the construction of royal palaces. As such, they may represent evidence of African slave-labor camps, a significant discovery.</p><p>"If these sites were work camps, we can get in and see the inner workings of a precolonial slave community in West Africa for the first time," said Monroe. "Slavery existed in Africa before the Europeans, and this kingdom was heavily entrenched in the slave trade. It's terribly exciting." He plans to conduct intensive excavation of the sites next summer, when he expects to enroll 15 students and volunteers in the field program.</p><p>"I like training students," he said. "It's good experience for them, and their work contributes to broader research questions."</p><p>Monroe is eager for answers to those questions.</p><p>"We know a lot from historians and anthropologists," he said. "But archaeology can reveal complex settlement patterns, and when we get answers to those questions, we'll know a lot more about the everyday lives of precolonial Africans."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915d9e0c8072704601a012ff64582585"><name>3326</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Message from Vice Chancellor Doyle about cyber security</title><start-date>1256713200000</start-date><display-name>Message from Vice Chancellor...</display-name><path>/2009/10/3326</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/3326</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339085777</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339085777</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As National Cyber Security Awareness Month comes to a close, I want to reinforce the need to be vigilant about two very relevant topics:  the importance of security when working remotely, and the need to guard against scams.</p><p>Working Remotely:</p><p>As we all know, there has been a steady increase in the numbers and kinds of computing devices that, among other things, make it possible for us to work virtually any time from any location.

A two-step proposal to increase fees will be considered by the UC Board of Regents at its November meeting.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/resolutions/ReslonSalaryReductions.pdf">second resolution</a> expressing the "sense of the Senate," UCSC faculty members also said they opposed the fact that UC-wide salary reductions, <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/?page_id=87">approved by the board this past summer</a>, were implemented for "workers whose full-time salary is $40,000 or less."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/21914">student-fee proposal</a>, expected to be considered by the Regents, recommends:</p>

<ul>
<li>A mid-year fee increase in 2009-10 to take effect with the spring semester. The proposal would hike fees by $585 for resident undergraduates, and between $579 and $654 for resident graduate students.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A second fee increase for the 2010-11 academic year. The proposal would hike fees by $1,344 for resident undergraduates, and between $1,332 and $1,506 for resident graduate students.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Several senators expressed concern that the resolution opposing salary reductions for lower-paid UCSC workers might have unintended negative consequences. "I would like to know what we're going to lose to pay for this," said biologist Barry Bowman. "One of the most likely ways this will be implemented is that some people will lose their jobs."</p>
<p>But literature professor Christopher Connery said "this is a human need...the statement that we don't want to be below that [$40,000] is a statement of principle."</p>

In the 20 years since then, increasingly sophisticated assessments of earthquake hazards have led to a better understanding of the seismic threat in the Bay Area and throughout California.</p>
<p>The bottom line from those assessments is clear and simple: Be prepared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good that people are remembering Loma Prieta 20 years later, because it is an example of what is to come. There will be comparable events in California over the next few decades, and some will be more damaging,&#8221; said seismologist Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Karen McNally, professor emerita of Earth and planetary sciences, was director of the Richter Seismological Laboratory and the Institute of Tectonics at UCSC in 1989. Thanks in part to her efforts, the seismological recordings of the Loma Prieta earthquake were the best that had ever been obtained for a large continental earthquake. As a result, scientists learned a great deal, not only about the faults in this area, but more generally about the factors that contribute to damaging ground shaking during an earthquake.</p>
<p>McNally, who recognized two earlier temblors in the region as possible precursors to a large earthquake, had installed state-of-the-art digital instruments for recording ground motions in the area where the San Andreas fault ruptured on October 17, 1989.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that a large earthquake was probably imminent on the timescale of a few months to a few years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was then testing prototype instruments designed for field work on large earthquakes, so I put those out in August.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the earthquake, additional instruments that had just been purchased by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) were sent to UCSC and installed in the field to record aftershocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly my entrance into modern digital seismology,&#8221; said Susan Schwartz, then a postdoctoral researcher working with McNally and now director of the Keck Seismology Laboratory at UCSC. &#8220;We had a lot of graduate students helping to put out the instruments, and we set up a processing center to handle the data. We learned a lot about the geometry of the fault zone and how the intensity of the shaking was affected by surface geology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Loma Prieta, California building codes have been updated to reflect new understanding of ground motions during an earthquake and better mapping of seismic hazards. McNally&#8217;s instruments recorded ground accelerations of 1 g or more, much greater than was thought possible for a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. Peak ground acceleration is a key factor in determining the amount of damage caused by an earthquake. Measurements of 1 g or more were later recorded during the 1994 Northridge earthquake (magnitude 6.7) in southern California, confirming McNally&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>The data recorded from Loma Prieta clearly showed that ground shaking is much more violent on soft sediments, such as those found on the margins of San Francisco Bay, than on bedrock. Geologists had previously recognized this effect, but new data helped to quantify it. There were also some surprises in the damage patterns from Loma Prieta that ultimately led to a better understanding of how the propagation of seismic waves through different geological structures can focus energy in certain areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now know so much more and can predict what the shaking is going to be in a given area,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;The U.S. Geological Survey can now issue a shake map right after an earthquake occurs that gives a preliminary estimate of the intensity of the shaking in different locations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shake maps are a valuable resource for emergency personnel and agencies directing the response to an earthquake. Lay noted that the capacity to rapidly record and analyze data from an earthquake has led to the development of automated systems for communicating information about an earthquake after it happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technological advances have really been speeding up how fast we can communicate information about an earthquake to governments, utilities, and railways, so they can do rapid responses like stopping trains and inspecting bridges,&#8221; Lay said. &#8220;Our response capability in California is getting better every year, although it&#8217;s still not quite as advanced as in Japan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Predicting earthquakes remains a challenging and perhaps insurmountable problem. But McNally emphasized the value of the earthquake probability forecasts that are available now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intermediate and long-term warnings are very useful if people know what to do with that information,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The most recent assessment of California earthquake hazards&#8211;the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/">Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast</a>&#8211;was issued in 2008. The forecasts include a greater than 99 percent probability of one or more magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquakes in California over the next 30 years. In the greater San Francisco Bay Area, the probability of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake is 63 percent, or about 2 out of 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are sobering numbers,&#8221; Lay said. &#8220;For the state as a whole, it&#8217;s almost a guaranteed occurrence. In the Bay Area, the primary concern is the Hayward fault, which has a particularly high perceived risk. Loma Prieta caused tremendous damage, but its epicenter was actually in a pretty remote area. A comparable event on the Hayward fault would be right under a densely populated area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz noted that while a lot has changed in earthquake science over the past 20 years, the basic messages of earthquake safety and preparedness are much the same: plan ahead; have emergency supplies on hand; eliminate hazards such as unsecured bookcases; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.earthquakecountry.info/dropcoverholdon">drop, cover, and hold on</a>&#8221; during an earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look at this anniversary as an opportunity for people to think about earthquake preparedness,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;It amazes me to realize that most of the students in my classes now weren&#8217;t even born then. It could happen again, and people should think about whether they&#8217;re prepared.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/2005/15/</url><title>USGS Earthquake Preparedness Handbook</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.earthquakecountry.info/</url><title>Earthquake Country Preparedness Information</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.shakeout.org/santacruz/</url><title>California ShakeOut earthquake drill on October 15</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26d530a8072704601a012ff552a223c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2009/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625327745</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625327745</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
