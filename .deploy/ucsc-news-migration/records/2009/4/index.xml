The plan provides strategies to attain the goals that UCSC has signed on to, which are to reduce GHG emissions to 2000 levels by 2014; to 1990 levels by 2020; to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050; and to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible.  </p><p>Strategies highlighted in the plan include aggressive implementation of energy-efficiency projects across campus, a new alternative-energy cogeneration plant, solar photovoltaic projects, creation of a climate action fund (mostly funded by a fee on all air travel reimbursements),  supporting teaching- and research-oriented demonstration projects, and enhancing the Campus Sustainability Office.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan has been released for public comment in order to ensure an inclusive and comprehensive plan. The public comment period is open until May 8, 2009. The plan and highlights of the 10 Climate Action recommendations can be downloaded from the STEPS Institute web site (steps.ucsc.edu), and comments can be e-mailed to climate@ucsc.edu. </p><p>"This is a perfect opportunity to identify areas that are missing and that need to be expanded, and to build support around strategies that are perceived as economically unfeasible," said Chancellor Climate Action intern, Tony Bautista. </p><p>The UCSC Climate Action Plan is a product of the Chancellor Council on Climate Change, which was created by UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal.

This  golf tournament is a fundraiser for NCAA Division III Women's Sports at UCSC, and proceeds are shared among all the teams. This infusion of additional dollars to their operating budget assists in meeting financial compliance with Title IX. As a result, men's sports can continue to add new dollars to their operating budget without impacting our ability to comply with this federal law. Funds raised also enhance the opportunity for women's teams to qualify for a bid to post-season play, and help to elevate our program on many levels. Now in its sixth year, this event is known for its fun, relaxed atmosphere using the Best Ball "Scramble" format where everyone is welcome and golfers of all levels can participate. There are games and contests with a wide range of fantastic prizes donated by local businesses, corporations, individuals, and various departments at UCSC. The tournament is staffed by student-athlete volunteers from the women's teams, which makes it especially rewarding for the golfers, who meet the athletes they are supporting. </p><p>The day concludes with a BBQ dinner provided by UCSC Dining Services in the DeLaveaga BBQ area. There is a live auction of unique items such as a framed Pasatiempo pin flag autographed by Juli Inkster, a local Santa Cruzan who is now a professional golfer on the LPGA Tour and member of the Hall of Fame. If you cannot make it to the event but are interested in an item, there will be an opportunity to submit a bid prior to the event. Please check our web site for updates. During dinner, prizes will be given out, and two awards will be presented: one to a senior female student-athlete for accomplishment in academics, athletics, and community service during her tenure at UCSC, and one to acknowledge an alumna athlete. </p><p>The registration fee of $160 per person includes green fees, cart, box lunch, BBQ dinner, beverages, and prizes. If you sign up by April 30th, the early-bird price is $135.

Alumni must pay a fee for services--$75 per year. But that gives them access to an array of options.</p><p>"Alumni taking advantage of the center would have the benefit of choosing the service they'd like to use, and they could get help from an adviser in doing initial or mid-career exploration," said Barbara Silverthorne, acting director.</p><p>Summer is a good time for alumni to visit because the center is not as busy with current students then, said Silverthorne. </p><p>Students are the biggest users of the Career Center, but alumni made more than 600 contacts with advisers last year, said Silverthorne. And graduates of any UC can use the Career Center at any other UC by paying the standard fee of that campus, something Silverthorne said is a little-known fact.</p><p>For Ronna Danziger Perelson, 50, of Mill Valley, visiting the Career Center resulted in a successful career change.</p><p>"After three careers, two degrees, and 30 years since high school, it was time to plan my next career," said Perelson ('80, Porter College, economics).</p><p>At the center, she took assessment tests, set up a plan to explore many types of careers, and worked on her resume with help from an adviser.</p><p>Mara MacDonald, a graduate adviser at the center, "taught me to treat a resume as a strategic document that needs to highlight experience, skills, and abilities that match requirements posed in a job posting, rather than treating it as an information dump," Perelson said. "I learned to describe my experience more sharply and in the terms relevant to and needed by the hiring entity."</p><p>She got a temporary job in catalog merchandising, then was promoted to a data management position. She then became a direct to consumer index manager with Restoration Hardware.</p><p>"Being a numbers person, I finally found my inner nerd and get to play with data all day," said Perelson, who previously worked in sales.</p><p>Vidya Kumar, 34, who got a job at Santur Corp., a Fremont manufacturer of optical components for optical networks, only regrets that he didn't visit the Career Center earlier.</p><p>Graduate adviser MacDonald "advised me how to research companies and how to come across as competent and competitive in the market," said Kumar, who earned a Ph.D. in physics at UCSC. "Looking for work is hard, and it's really important to get counseling and help in this phase of one's career."</p><p>He did a mock interview and presentation, as well as a behavioral interview.</p><p>"It was all incredibly useful," he said.</p><p>The Career Center offers individual advising, workshops, career fairs, resource materials, special events, job listings, and more.

Numbers released today (April 7, 2009) by UC's Office of the President indicate that UCSC provided offers of admission to 16,135 prospective freshmen-63.7 percent of the 25,341 California high-school seniors who applied. Last year the campus admitted 74.3 percent of the California freshman applicants; two years ago, 82.8 percent.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The declining "admit rate" is a reflection of the campus's increasing selectivity in freshman admission, said Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management.</p>
<p>"Interest from prospective students in attending UC Santa Cruz continues to climb, as illustrated by our admission rate that has gone from 83 to 74 to 64 percent in just two years," Whittingham said. "For two consecutive years, no other UC campus has experienced this kind of increase in selectivity."</p>
<p>"We are also quite pleased by the academic achievement and diversity of the admitted students," Whittingham added. Among admitted freshmen, the mean grade point average increased from last year's 3.69 to 3.76 this year, and the SAT reasoning total (critical reading, mathematics, and writing) increased from 1760 to 1787. And, as UCSC's freshman admissions have become more competitive, the campus has continued to increase its percentage of admitted freshmen from underrepresented ethnic groups-from 22.7 percent last year to 23.4 percent this year. Chicanos and Latinos account for 19.9 percent of admitted students, up from 19.2 percent last year. The percentage of African Americans decreased slightly from 2.8 percent last year to 2.6 percent this year. American Indians represent .9 percent of admitted students this year, compared with .6 percent last year.</p>
<p>Thousands of admitted students and their families are already scheduled to visit the campus during UCSC's "2009 Spring Spotlight" activities for admitted students. Continuing through April 18, the activities include daily student-led walking tours-providing an overview of the academic, residential, and student-life experience at UCSC. Admitted students and families see Spring Spotlight days as an opportunity to visit UCSC's 10 residential colleges, attend presentations, and visit classrooms. For more information, please go to: <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springSpotlight/">admissions.ucsc.edu/springSpotlight/</a>.</p>
<p>Admitted freshmen have until May 1 to file a "statement of intent to register," indicating their intention to enroll at UCSC. The campus's admissions decisions for this coming fall are based on its goal of enrolling no more than 3,620 freshmen; that is a reduction of 335 from fall 2008.</p>

This unsanctioned, unwelcome and illegal activity diminishes UCSC's reputation and draws negative attention to the campus. Additionally, this event creates multiple challenges for the campus and creates unacceptable risks to safety. Your safety is paramount, as is the need to continue campus operations that support learning. Therefore, the following measures will be in place:<br/>
<br/>
<p>April 17 - April 20:</p>

<ul>
<li>A "no-guest" policy in on-campus residence halls has been instituted per contractual agreements. The "no overnight guest" policy begins Friday, April 17 and concludes on Monday, April 20.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>On Monday, April 20:</p>

<ul>
<li>The West Entrance to campus will be closed to inbound vehicular traffic, beginning at 3 p.m. and will remain closed until traffic personnel determine that it is appropriate to re-open.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Metro buses and campus shuttles, including the "loop" vehicles, will be re-routed away from the west side of campus, beginning at 3 pm. Metro buses will enter campus through the Main entrance only, travel up Coolidge, and loop back to the Main Entrance via Hagar. Metro buses during this period of time will only make one stop in the campus core: on Hagar, between Quarry Plaza and OPERS.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A reduced number of campus shuttles will continue to connect the east and west sides of campus-following the normal "core" route west, before turning uphill on Heller, and returning along McLaughlin to the east side of campus. (Disability van service, with the possible exception of delays caused by traffic congestion, will be unaffected by these changes.)<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Campus parking regulations will be strictly enforced.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Sections of Empire Grade, uphill from the Arboretum, will be designated as a tow-away zone. Extra patrols will be on duty to enforce this restriction, and vehicles will be ticketed and towed at owners' expense.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UCSC continues to educate students about the risks of alcohol and drug use, provide alternative activities, and enforce University policies. Yet, ultimately, activities such as this are shaped by the individual choices and behaviors of community members. I encourage you to engage with your peers, other university community members and Student Affairs staff about these issues. We can support you in planning and participating in alternative activities that highlight your accomplishments as scholars and engaged world citizens.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Felicia McGinty, Vice Chancellor Student Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a4f348072704601a012ff00b0b456"><name>2827</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC grad students to present exhibition of digital art with social impact at Museum of Art and History</title><summary>Ten graduate students from UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) program will present a two-part exhibition at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz, running April 17 to June 24.</summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>DANM, digital arts, new media, exhbitions, arts, mseum, social impact, , installatios, technology, computers, artists, interactivity</keywords><description>Ten graduate students from UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) program will present a two-part exhibition at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz, running April 17 to June 24.</description><start-date>1239606000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC grad students to...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2827</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2827</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338868987</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338868987</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/danm_crop_ban_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/danm_crop_ban_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>danm_crop_ban_350.jpg</name><file-size>31898</file-size><width>354</width><height>126</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/soraya_310_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/soraya_310_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>soraya_310_350.jpg</name><file-size>58072</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>"One notable quality of the DANM program at UCSC is its commitment to translating theory into practice," notes faculty member Soraya Murray (above), curator of the  exhibition.

(photo: Scott Rappaport)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ten graduate students from UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) program will present a two-part exhibition at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz, running April 17 to June 24.</p>
<p>Titled interACTIVATE, the exhibit will explore the intersection of digital art and social consciousness. It is the culmination of two years of research and artistic exploration by the students into digital media art and its many social impacts.</p>
<p>"Each of the projects are very different, although they all utilize digital media to contemplate key concerns of our time," noted DANM faculty member Soraya Murray, curator of the exhibition.</p>
<p>"It's not necessarily what you might expect of a digital arts exhibition," Murray added. "The works are designed to provoke a response about a number of subjects beyond the digital, ranging from the politics of food, to the economic downturn and the right of public dissent."</p>
<p>Melanie Stewart's "Blissomatic Surreal" is a media installation about private and public space-based on the student's own love/hate relationship with technology. While Stewart embraces technological tools that mix video, photo manipulation and sound collages with traditional arts, she often recoils from the invasion of professional life into personal life as a result of "always with us" and "always on" technologies such as cell phones and e-mail.</p>
<p>By juxtaposing today's eagerness for accessibility and productivity alongside a sentimental point of view about the simpler joys of life associated with the 60s and 70s, Stewart's installation is designed for viewers to "confront their own personal map of the breakdown between these two spaces."</p>
<p>Troy Allman describes his "294" project as the result of a 42-week research and development venture, in which a clerical office was used as his primary living space. This unusual living situation inspired the creation of a series of devices designed to make the clerical office more functional as a living space, "while incorporating the aesthetic of the office environment."</p>
<p>Allman's devices--created during the onset of last year's mortgage crisis-offer a satirical commentary on alternative living during times of economic hardship, and visitors to the exhibit are "encouraged to explore the artifacts in their form, functionality, and absurdity."</p>
<p>"One notable quality of the DANM program is its commitment to translating theory into practice," noted Murray. "It is theoretically rigorous, but students are also trained to be practicing artists. The work is very intellectual, introspective and involved with social concerns; at the same time, they're producing some of the most cutting-edge types of art."</p>
<p>"They're engaged with the most forward thinking notions of what art can be," Murray added. "Since the 1960s there's been an ever broadening notion about what constitutes art, and about where and how art happens. And I think for a lot of artists in the exhibition, that art happens in the moment when the viewer activates the work through their participation. So in a sense, the audience completes the artwork by interacting with it and generating an experience."</p>

Gabe was a Cowell College "founding fellow," arriving at UCSC in 1965, the year the campus opened.  He taught courses in Spanish literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly poetry; literature of exile and of the Spanish Civil War; and the theory and practice of literary translation.</p><p>As well as his teaching accomplishments, he was active as a translator of Spanish literature, most notably the work of Rafael Alberti, "The Lost Grove:  Autobiography of a Spanish Poet in Exile" published by the University of California Press in 1976, and including a splendid Preface.</p><p>He earned his Ph.D. in Romance Languages (Spanish) from Ohio State University in 1968 and taught in Costa Rica, Madrid, and Monterrey, Mexico before joining UCSC as an Acting Assistant Professor of Spanish Language and Literature in 1965.  Gabe retired from UCSC in 1991.</p><p>After retirement, Gabe worked indefatigably as a translator in San Francisco for people who lacked English language skills and who needed assistance with immigration and other business matters.  For all his scholarly and humanistic accomplishments, Gabe will be remembered best by his friends as a charming, generous and delightful colleague.</p><p>His widow, Arlette, and sons, Cris and Joshua, have indicated, following Gabe's wishes, that there will be no memorial service or formal obituary.  </p><p> </p><p>On behalf of the campus, I extend our sympathy to Gabe's family and pay tribute to his long career at UCSC and to his deep commitment to his many students. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Georges Van Den Abbele, Dean of Humanities</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a51c78072704601a012ffdddd7bc0"><name>2829</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pool temporarily closing for renovation</title><keywords>pool renovation</keywords><start-date>1239087600000</start-date><display-name>Pool temporarily closing for...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2829</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2829</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338869651</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338869651</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As you may already know, the 50-meter pool at the East Field House is scheduled to be closed for renovation and repairs from approximately April through August.

<hr/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"As we prepare to implement what will be painful budget cuts in Social Sciences, misinformation is circulating about the potential impact of those cuts on the Community Studies program.</p>
<p>"Here is what is actually happening:</p>
<p>"As has been reported, UC Santa Cruz faces an estimated cut in permanent state funding for fiscal year 2009-10 of $13 million. This is on top of one-time and permanent campus cuts imposed last fiscal year that totaled over $6 million. The Social Sciences Division will absorb $1.3 million of those cuts in the next fiscal year. A budget reduction of this magnitude will necessarily impact many of our division's undergraduate and graduate degree programs.</p>
<p>"There are no easy choices, and all of the cuts will be painful.</p>
<p>"We are considering eliminating administrative support positions in Community Studies. Administrative support for this academic program will continue, and will be provided by one or more of our Social Science departments. Students enrolled in the Community Studies major - including 2009 frosh who declare that major - are unaffected. They will continue to have a full range of academic support.</p>
<p>"And, contrary to rumors, there has been no decision, or even a formal proposal, to discontinue the Community Studies major."</p>

<p>We can all take pride in several recent campus milestones:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Academic Senate recently approved significant revisions to undergraduate General Education requirements and added a new writing requirement that will help prepare every student to communicate effectively in a 21st century global economy.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>In late March, we announced a formal agreement with NASA to lease 75 acres at its NASA-Ames facility in Silicon Valley for an innovative, sustainable teaching and research collaboration involving several other colleges and universities. This is a strategic investment in a region known for innovation and entrepreneurship -- qualities that make UCSC the ideal lead partner for this venture.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>In the past several weeks, we have received several significant financial gifts in support of education and research initiatives. I am gratified by this support, particularly in these tough economic times.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I'm also proud of the fact that our people continue to earn accolades for their own efforts:</p>

<ul>
<li>On April 23, Professor Sandy Faber will receive the Bower Award and Prize from the historic Franklin Institute, one of the most prestigious awards in science. This award clearly acknowledges Sandy's accomplishments as one of the world's top scientists. I'm looking forward to joining her at the award ceremony in Philadelphia.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Two of our newer faculty -- Samit Dasgupta, assistant professor of mathematics, and Mark Krumholz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics -- have been named Sloan Research Fellows. The prestigious Sloan awards support the work of exceptional young researchers early in their academic careers. We now have 25 Sloan winners teaching at UCSC.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Humanities lecturer and alumnus Gary Young won the 2009 Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. The prestigious national award is given annually to "a living American poet selected with reference to genius and need."<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A graduating senior, biology major Annick Lamb, is the first UCSC student-athlete to win an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship and is the only female winner from a California university this year. In addition to being a record-setting soccer player, Annick works as an undergraduate researcher in a molecular, cell, and developmental biology research laboratory. Last year she participated in the Education Abroad Program in environmental biology in Costa Rica.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Spring quarter brings even more promise. I am delighted that professors Martin Chemers and Margaret Delaney have agreed to lead our Silicon Valley initiatives, succeeding the recently retired Joe Miller. We also expect to soon announce exceptional new deans for the Arts division and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take advantage of interesting and informative opportunities on campus this spring. Later this month, we will welcome hundreds of loyal Slugs back to campus for Reunion Weekend, which will include on Friday, April 24, this year's Intellectual Forum featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr., followed on Saturday by a distinguished panel featuring two UCSC alums -- NPR science reporter Richard Harris and Claire Strader, a former apprentice at the Farm and a candidate for White House "farmer;" and faculty member Daniel Press. In May, Arts &amp; Lectures will feature an appearance by Garrison Keilor.</p>
<p>In June, you will have an opportunity at a public forum to meet finalists for the Chief Diversity Officer position. Plans already are well under way for our annual undergraduate student achievement awards, the spring graduate research symposium, and June commencement activities.</p>
<p>Let me also remind you of an opportunity to engage in important campus planning. I am seeking feedback on the draft Climate Action Plan prepared by the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change. You can review the plan at <a href="http://www.steps.ucsc.edu/">http://www.steps.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p>
<p>While continuing to make impressive progress, we also face many challenges as a campus community. We are making strategic, though difficult, budget cuts and reallocating resources where they can have greatest impact. We are in consultation with the Academic Senate, divisional deans, and others on how we move forward. These aren't easy decisions, and they will impact our teaching, research and service enterprise.</p>
<p>Still, I am confident that by working together we can move beyond our current challenges and position ourselves for a stronger future.</p>
<p>As always, I invite your comments at <a href="mailto:chancellor@ucsc.edu">chancellor@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

High-fives and fist-pumps went around as the scoring team hustled back down court to set up its zone defense, arms up, knees flexed.</p>
<p>There was the usual air of competition you'd expect of a basketball game in a high school gym on a bright, sunny Sunday morning. But for the Banana Slugs Special Olympics basketball team, winning the game was less important than playing in it. For these athletes--who have developmental disabilities such as Down syndrome--every step is a jubilation, every basket a triumph.</p>
<p>And for Coach Brittany Guest, 23, a fifth-year UCSC health sciences student who's volunteered coaching Special Olympics her entire college career, it's all about heart.</p>
<p>"My team is so huggy and lovey and adoring," said Guest, who directs the Special Olympics program for the Santa Cruz area. "They just want to play with you and laugh with you and adore you. They're beautiful people inside and out."</p>
<p>The hoops game on Sunday against Santa Clara had a special poignancy--it was Guest's last. This is her final year of coaching, since she graduates in June.</p>
<p>The Huntington Beach native signed up to get involved with Special Olympics at the first OPERS fall festival she attended when she came to UCSC.</p>
<p>"I went to my first bowling practice and fell in love with it, and ended up staying five years," Guest said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Special Olympics Northern California offers bowling in the fall, basketball in the winter, and track and field in spring.</p>
<p>The program gives participants physical exercise, but it also gets them out and about, said Cindy Blyther, sports manager for Special Olympics Northern California.</p>
<p>"It gives them something to do and provides the feeling of being part of a team," she said. "Also, it offers opportunities to interact with people and learn social skills."</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz Special Olympics program is unique because it's the only student-run program in Northern California.</p>
<p>Guest is a rare volunteer, said Blyther.</p>
<p>"Some college students come out for a practice or two but rarely for an entire season, let alone become head coach," Blyther said.</p>
<p>Guest said she's learned a lot from the Special Olympics participants.</p>
<p>"They are so loving, and they are so welcoming," she said. "You could have purple hair and be pierced in 20 places on your face, and they would never think twice about passing judgment on you. It's an incredible human interaction that I don't get with many other humans."</p>
<p>Assistant Coach Claire Love, 20, a sophomore in the health sciences program, is poised to take over for Guest.</p>
<p>"It's a lot to take on, but I'm excited," said Love. "All the players are so happy to be at the games. The excitement rubs off on me. It's so inspiring."</p>
<p>Guest will be missed, though.</p>
<p>"Oh my goodness, everyone's going to miss Brittany," said parent Linda Bright, of Santa Cruz. Her daughter, Audrey, 20, has played with Guest during all of Guest's time coaching.</p>
<p>"When you're a Special Olympics coach, you deal with everything--their medical, their emotional, their handicap," said Bright. "It's just amazing to take that challenge on. Sometimes I don't even know if parents understand how incredible the people are who do this."</p>
<p>"The coaches make a special bond. They do," agreed Michael Bright, Audrey's dad.</p>
<p>"I <em>love</em> Brittany!" exclaimed Banana Slugs player Leah Radach, 27. "She's a nice girl."</p>
<p>"She always gives me smiles," agreed Allison Orr, 23. "She's a nice coach. She told me to do sports. I work very hard in practice, walking and passing and shooting."</p>
<p>Players at Sunday's game ranged in age from their teens to their 40s or 50s. Men and women played together, with the referee gently guiding them at times. The Banana Slugs emerged victorious, beating Santa Clara 24-10 in a decisive win.</p>
<p>"Sports gives them them a good social structure and helps them gain confidence," said Michael Bright. "And it gives them exposure to people like Brittany, who's wonderful."</p>
<p>"They take it very seriously," said parent Suzette Birnbaum, of Soquel, mom of player Teddy Parelius, 13. "A lot of times, even if they don't win, they feel like they're winners."</p>

There are no easy choices, and all of the cuts will be painful. Many of our undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as administrative operations, will be impacted.</p><p>As we continue preparing to implement these cuts by July 1, misinformation has been circulating about the potential impact of divisional cuts on the Community Studies Department. I am writing to clarify what is actually happening.</p><p>First, no final decisions concerning any of our anticipated budget cuts have been made. One option under consideration is reorganizing the delivery of administrative support functions. Although this may result in some job loss, the support functions for the program will continue to be provided. The goal of this move would be to streamline and consolidate operations while maintaining support for students and faculty. All ladder-rank faculty positions would be preserved.</p><p>Second, all students enrolled in the Community Studies major -- including 2009 frosh declaring that major -- would be unaffected. Our goal would be to maintain a full range of academic support.</p><p>Third, contrary to rumors, there is no decision -- or even formal proposal -- to discontinue the Community Studies major. Proposals to add, modify, or eliminate undergraduate majors are made not by the Dean, but by division faculty in full consultation with the campus's Academic Senate. I do, as part of ongoing strategic planning, intend to continue to engage faculty in a thoughtful, ongoing discussion about the Community Studies program. And, I am committed to exploring ways to ensure that students throughout the Social Sciences Division have opportunities to participate in community service, as they do now in many of our academic programs.</p><p>Finally, it has always been my intention to continue to engage our division's faculty and staff, the Academic Senate and campus leadership in transparently working toward the difficult decisions we all face in the wake of such challenging economic circumstances.</p><p>As I have said, all budget reductions are difficult. These, due to their scope, will be especially so. We will continue to plan in accordance with the principles and guidelines set forth and reiterated on various occasions by Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Kliger.</p><p>Thank you for your continued interest and support. I will keep you informed as we move forward.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Sheldon Kamieniecki</p><p>Dean, Division of Social Sciences</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a5e648072704601a012ff51a3c8a1"><name>2837</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Biochemists Roger Linington and Scott Lokey are featured in a &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1086830660&amp;play=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CNBC TV news story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about their work at the UCSC Chemical Screening Center.</summary><description>Biochemists Roger Linington and Scott Lokey are featured in a &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1086830660&amp;play=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CNBC TV news story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about their work at the UCSC Chemical Screening Center.</description><start-date>1239346800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2837</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2837</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338872879</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338872879</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Biochemists Roger Linington and Scott Lokey are featured in a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1086830660&amp;play=1"><strong>CNBC TV news story</strong></a> about their work at the UCSC Chemical Screening Center to evaluate compounds from marine microbes as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.</p>

"After they defeated that proposal, all construction came under attack."</p><p>The presence of UCSC helped transform the town, as well, acknowledged Domhoff. UCSC welcomed its first students in 1965, after the city of Santa Cruz scored an upset victory over San Jose's Almaden Valley in the competition to host the newest UC campus. Landing UCSC "saved the town" following the erosion of the city's heavy industries, including logging and leather tanning. "This city was dying because the only thing they had left was tourism," said Domhoff. "It was a big fight by the moneyed interests to get the university in Santa Cruz, and it made the land infinitely more valuable forever." </p><p>UCSC has been an economic powerhouse, bringing thousands of students to town and providing hundreds of jobs. From its earliest days, it also attracted liberal faculty, staff, and students, who ultimately transformed the community, according to Domhoff. </p><p>"UCSC founders Dean McHenry and Page Smith embraced a liberal arts model that attracted a special kind of student--they didn't want fraternities and sororities, or football games, or a business school, because we didn't have any of that," said Domhoff. "It attracted students who were, in general, very open-minded and who became political because of the events of the 1960s."</p><p>"UCSC has always had twice the national average of liberal students, and that image attracted more of them," he said. "More importantly, the first faculty and staff became neighborhood leaders." Current Santa Cruz Mayor Cynthia Mathews, whose husband is an astronomy professor, became involved in politics decades ago to protect the amenities of Santa Cruz, as did current City Councilwoman Katherine Beiers, who worked as a campus librarian for many years, he observed.</p><p>For McHenry, who wanted good relationships with the town's business leaders, the emergence of a vocal coalition of neighborhood activists was problematic. "The university saved the town, but there's irony, because it created a rival power base," said Domhoff.</p><p>Student voters made up only 10 to 13 percent of the electorate, but they voted with a uniformity that determined the outcome of many local elections in the 1970s and 1980s, noted Domhoff. By the late 1970s, many alumni who had remained in town after graduating had reshaped the city's landscape, putting a focus on social services, environmental advocacy, women's health, affordable housing, and "quality of life" issues such as neighborhood preservation. By 1981, progressives won a majority on the City Council.</p><p>Rebuilding downtown Santa Cruz after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 gave the "growth machine" another opportunity to reassert itself, but it was thwarted by organized residents and elected officials who wanted to preserve the city's unique character and support independent businesses. A subsequent battle over proposed factory-outlet stores yielded another defeat for the growth machine and "set in stone that neighborhood activists and environmentalists would dominate the progressive coalition."</p><p>"The key to understanding social change is to realize that a handful of really dedicated, focused people can have a huge impact, because most of us are busy with our everyday lives," said Domhoff. "There aren't monuments to the city's early leaders, but what they fought for has become a part of everyday life."</p><p>Domhoff coauthored the book with Richard Gendron, an associate professor of sociology at Assumption College in Massachusetts. Gendron conducted much of the research for <i>The Leftmost City</i> while earning a doctorate in sociology from UCSC.</p><p>[Domhoff will give a reading and talk about <i>The Leftmost City</i> on Thursday, April 23, at noon at the Bay Tree Bookstore. More information about the book, including an overview and many colorful images, is available <a href="http://leftmostcity.com">online</a>. This year's recipient of the Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Faculty Award, Domhoff will also be honored during a luncheon on April 24, 2009, in the Cultural Center at Merrill College. Tickets for the luncheon, which kicks off UCSC's annual <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/">Alumni Reunion Weekend</a>, are $20 for members of the UCSC Alumni Association and $25 for nonmembers.

To that end, I write to you regarding a non-University sanctioned event which, although actively discouraged by University officials, nevertheless continues to occur on our campus. Often referred to as "Four-Twenty" or "4/20," participants come together, more or less spontaneously, on April 20 at 4:20 pm for the purpose of smoking marijuana and to a lesser extent, using other illegal substances. While similar "4/20 celebrations" occur simultaneously on college campuses across the United States, over the past four years the event here at UCSC has grown in numbers, with many of the participants being visitors with no investment in our UCSC community. The growth in scale of this activity has become a concern for both the University and surrounding community.</p><p>In an effort to maintain the safety of our students and ensure continuity of instruction and services, we continue to institute measures designed to strongly discourage students and others from participating in this 4/20 event. Among other efforts, a "no guest" policy in on-campus residence halls has been instituted per contractual agreements. The "no overnight guest" policy begins on Friday, April 18, 8:00 p.m. and concludes on Monday, April 20, 2009. To ensure safety, additional measures will be taken to limit access to campus for non-affiliates. Likewise, for a limited time bus transportation will be curtailed, access to campus will be limited and illegally parked cars will be towed.</p><p>UCSC continues to educate students about the risks of alcohol and drug use, provide alternative activities, and actively enforce University policies. Yet, student culture is largely shaped by the individual choices of the community members. We are concerned about the public use of marijuana and other illegal drugs on 4/20, as such activities can have both personal and community consequences. The use of illegal substances is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and can result in judicial sanctions. I encourage you to talk with your student about his or her plans for 4/20. Ask direct questions about the choices they make and express your expectations regarding marijuana, alcohol or other drug use. Although students may not initiate discussion on this topic, your opinions and expectations can influence their behavior. Research shows that students are influenced by on-going family discourse regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs.</p><p>The first year of college is filled with many choices, changes and challenges for students. With your support and our collective partnership, our students can achieve academic and personal success here at UCSC. Thank you in advance for your support and continued partnership.

<p><em><strong>Alan Richards,</strong> professor of environmental studies, is the recipient of the Alumni Association's 2008-09 Distinguished Teaching Award. An economist and an expert on energy politics and the Middle East, Richards created the class</em> Blood and Oil: Energy, the Middle East, and War, <em>to give students a historically based understanding of current events. We asked Richards to discuss climate change and the role educators can play in meeting the challenge. Excerpts from the interview follow.</em></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>I am deeply troubled by the disconnect between what public policymakers and natural scientists are saying about climate change. Leading scientists say we have three years to reverse the rate of carbon emissions and avert serious consequences.</p>
<p>So that's the bad news: Nobody in the public policy world is talking about actions that could do that. Instead, emissions are growing at a rate of about 3 percent a year. This is manifestly unsustainable. These emissions build up cumulatively, which is important. It's like piling on blankets. You may get too warm, but once you stop adding blankets, you're still hot.</p>
<p>And it gets worse, because everywhere in the world for the past 250 years, increasing standards of living have been accompanied by large-scale increases in the use of energy per person, especially in the relatively early phases of economic growth.</p>
<p>Yet it would be unreasonable and politically unfair for rich western countries to tell poor countries that they shouldn't become better off. So the big problem is how to make room in the atmosphere for the emissions that are going to come from poorer countries, without doing irreversible damage.</p>

<h3>International impacts</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>But the good news is the United States finally has a government that appears to understand this. Having a less belligerent administration is good because we need to make international deals. The United States and the Chinese have been locked in a suicide pact; they say it's our fault, and we say it's their fault. Both sides are right.</p>
<p>The consequences of large-scale climate change include, according to the CIA, very scary impacts on international politics. For example, if the glaciers that sustain the major Asian rivers dry up and the water supplies of Northern India and Central China are seriously challenged, the governments of those countries-both of which have nuclear weapons-will face enormous pressures. Similarly, there could be large-scale immigration, literally floods of very poor people, moving from North Africa to Western Europe.</p>

<h3>Devil's in the details</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In the short term, this is a political problem, not a technological one, because the technology to reduce emissions already exists. There's an emerging consensus, led by people like Al Gore, that we need to electrify the economy and build a smart grid to generate electricity from renewable resources. We need serious public investment in changing the nature of the energy system, and we need incentives like a carbon tax, which people have been talking about for 20 years.</p>
<p>But, as always, the devil is in the details: Are there enough votes in Congress to pass legislation to implement the changes we need? What about the millions of Americans who continue to disbelieve in climate change? They appear to be turning into a minority force, but we've seen before that minority forces can still block important legislation.</p>
<p>As a social scientist, I think the scariest part of this is what I've learned from history. My reading of history suggests that people make deep, wrenching changes only in a severe crisis. But with climate change, by the time the crisis hits, it's too late.</p>

<h3>This is the way change happens</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The bottom line is that we had better get started. The nature of this problem is so large that everybody has to do what they can, as journalists, teachers, researchers, artists, and private citizens.</p>
<p>I believe we can avert the worst, but education will be critical. Sixty-nine percent of voters aged 29 and younger went for Obama. The youth get it. A lot of UCSC students are very engaged, and so is the chancellor. Our researchers are developing technological advances that could make this transition easier. (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/article.asp?pid=2846">Read about</a> what UCSC researchers are working on.) This is an institution that collectively understands that we must do something, even in the midst of collapsing budgets and exploding enrollments.</p>
<p>This is the way change happens. The analogy I prefer is race relations. When I graduated from a segregated high school in Dallas in 1964, there was open, virulent racism. But last November, 57 percent of Dallas County voted for Obama. So I know change is possible.</p>
<p>Who pioneered that change? It was the Civil Rights Movement. But universities and educators helped foster the necessary cultural shift that delegitimized racism. Is racism gone? No, it's not. But it has been delegitimized, and there's no reason the same thing can't happen with respect to the environment. Deeply destructive environmental behaviors can be delegitimized.</p>
<p>Universities are hubs of innovation, and they are incubators for social change. We have enough scientific knowledge to make a big dent in global warming. But there has been a great deal of fiddling while the planet burns.</p>

<p>"Current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that irreversibly change the planet," says Susan Solomon, lead author of a 2009 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) study on rising CO2 levels.</p>
<p>Former vice president and climate change activist Al Gore is cautiously optimistic that we can still successfully address climate change if we take immediate and decisive action. "It is retrievable and solvable-if we start now on a bold program," said Gore.</p>
<p>UCSC scientists are helping to meet the challenge by pioneering innovative alternatives to fossil fuels-from super-thin solar energy materials to renewable hydrogen. And because humans won't stop burning oil and gas anytime soon, research teams are also exploring ways to make fossil fuels cleaner and more efficient. Many of these advances draw on UCSC's leadership in nanotechnology, which provides a treasure chest of new tools to address tough energy challenges. And the campus's longstanding partnerships with Silicon Valley are helping to put much-needed new technologies into practical use.</p>
<p>However, warns UCSC's Ali Shakouri, professor of electrical engineering, "Engineering solutions alone won't be enough to address the world's environmental and energy problems. We also need to make societal changes in the ways we use energy, and that will be far more difficult."</p>

<h3>Getting more sun</h3>
<p>Solar energy is widely seen as the cornerstone of a green revolution that can revitalize the U.S. economy while saving the planet. Unfortunately, the solar industry's reliance on traditional silicon panels (the ones we see on rooftops) greatly limits its potential. The problem is that refining silicon is expensive, energy intensive, and fairly toxic-plus the cells and panels themselves are difficult to mass produce.</p>
<p>"We need a paradigm shift-a complete change in the way we manufacture photovoltaics," said UCSC's Sue Carter, professor of physics and a leading solar energy researcher. "Silicon-based solar panels are relatively efficient at generating electricity, but there is no way we can produce enough of them in the near term to put a dent in fossil fuel plants."</p>
<p>Carter's research team is creating the next generation of solar energy-liquid materials that can be applied in very thin layers much like printing a newspaper. Carter's approach is cheaper because it uses far less material and energy to produce than do silicon panels. It is also safer and can be applied to just about anything, including flexible materials like thin plastic and fabric.</p>
<p>"With print-based manufacturing, all of a sudden you can produce large areas of solar-generating material quite cheaply," added Carter.</p>
<p>Carter's research is already having an impact on the industrial landscape. She proudly lists former graduate students who play key roles at innovative solar startups, and Carter herself is a technical adviser to a number of leading-edge firms.</p>
<p>With Glenn Alers, UCSC adjunct professor of physics, Carter has also initiated</p>
<p>the Laboratory for Solar Energy and Renewable Fuels (SERF). SERF is part of the Advanced Studies Laboratories, a technology incubator located at the NASA Ames Research Center and sponsored by UCSC's <a href="http://svi.ucsc.edu">Silicon Valley Initiatives</a> (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/article.asp?pid=2847">UCSC recently announced a partnership with NASA.</a>). "We can offer the experimental expertise needed to help study new materials and incorporate emerging technologies into commercial products more effectively," said Carter.</p>

<h3>Fill 'er up - on water and sunshine</h3>
<p>The so-called hydrogen economy is a compelling vision. Hydrogen is a very clean fuel, and there's definitely a lot of it around--mostly linked with oxygen in the form of water. And while it's not complicated to separate out the hydrogen, the process requires a fair amount of energy.</p>
<p>UCSC chemistry professor <a href="http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/faculty/zhang.html">Jin Zhang</a> is working toward what he calls the "holy grail" of carbon-negative hydrogen--hydrogen produced without using fossil fuel. His ultimate goal is a device that will turn water into hydrogen using only solar energy. "We need to overcome some technical problems," said Zhang, "but the potential of this research is enormous."</p>
<p>Zhang's work is attracting a lot of interest, including major research funding from the U.S. Department of Energy. "The theory works," said Zhang. "We can actually do it, but we can't yet generate hydrogen efficiently enough for it to be practical. We need to make it competitive with gas for people to actually use it."</p>
<p>Zhang and his research team are developing and testing new nanomaterials for a two-part integrated system that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight.</p>
<p>"In theory," said Zhang, "you could have this device on one side of your car, with perhaps solar collectors on the roof, and just refuel with your garden hose."</p>
<p>Realistically, he added, we might first see a hybrid vehicle that runs on its own solar-generated hydrogen when the sun is out-and on another fuel at night or on cloudy days.</p>

<h3>New heat wave</h3>
<p>UCSC's <a href="http://quantum.soe.ucsc.edu">Ali Shakouri</a> made news in 2001 when his research team developed a "refrigerator on a chip." The tiny device--about the width of a human hair--uses engineered nanomaterials with just the right electrical and thermal properties to cool hot spots in microprocessors.</p>
<p>Now Shakouri is turning that breakthrough on its head, developing similar materials to turn waste heat from cars and power plants into electricity. His work, like Zhang's, relies on designing new materials at the nanoscale. "Our task is to engineer materials that don't exist in nature," said Shakouri.</p>
<div class="info_box">
<h4>Plugging In: Making Changes in the way we use energy</h4>
<p>As an engineer, Ali Shakouri seeks technical solutions, but he says that not even the most sophisticated new technologies can solve our energy problems without major changes in the ways we use energy. To help bridge that gap, Shakouri launched his interdisciplinary Renewable Energy course in 2006. <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/article.asp?pid=2851">Read more &#187;</a></p>
</div>
<p>Put simply, when materials of differing temperatures come in contact, the more active electrons on the warmer side tend to flow to the cooler side, thereby generating electrical current. Shakouri's new materials are making the process more efficient, in effect "herding" electrons and heat where he wants them to go.</p>
<p>Shakouri heads the <a href="http://quantum.soe.ucsc.edu/tec">Thermionic Energy Conversion (TEC) Center,</a> a major national initiative that brings together top materials scientists, engineers, and physicists from seven universities to attack various aspects of the waste heat problem. Supported by a multimillion-dollar investment from the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Projects Agency, partners in TEC include UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, Purdue University, University of Delaware, Harvard University, MIT, and BSST Inc.</p>
<p>Shakouri is optimistic that TEC's heat-capturing technology will be able to increase fuel efficiency by as much as 15 percent. It isn't ready to install in vehicles yet, he adds, but we can expect to see a test model within the next four to five years.</p>

<h3>Going carbon negative</h3>
<p>Escalating CO2 in the atmosphere not only contributes to global warming but is also rapidly making the world's oceans more acidic as they absorb all that excess CO2. According to Gregory Rau, a senior researcher at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, this change in ocean pH is already linked to declines in coral and other marine organisms.</p>
<p>"We need to implement sustainable energy sources immediately," said Rau, "but no matter how quickly we can gear up, fossil fuels will still be with us for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p>At UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, Rau is testing an ingenious method of removing excess CO2 that takes its cue from nature. "We're simply accelerating the natural process of limestone weathering," he explained, "which is one of the ways nature consumes excess atmospheric CO2 and neutralizes ocean acidity." Unfortunately, Rau adds, in nature that process takes many thousands of years.</p>
<p>Rau's process borrows a technique from saltwater aquarium hobbyists, who use a comparable reaction to maintain the proper pH in tanks of coral and shellfish. Rau mixes limestone particles with seawater and pumps simulated power plant exhaust through the mix. His test reactor balances seawater chemistry while successfully removing up to 95 percent of incoming CO2.</p>
<p>Scaled-up reactors could potentially absorb the CO2 emitted by power plants, while benefiting ocean ecosystems. Rau is also working on a "supercharged" version of the technology designed to scrub CO2 from the general atmosphere, not just waste streams. The trick is making the process faster and more efficient by adding a jolt of electricity-from renewable sources.</p>
<p>"This could be done on a large scale," said Rau. "For example, we might see fleets of barges on the open ocean, loaded with limestone and covered with wind turbines, solar panels, or wave energy converters to power the reaction." An added benefit of the process is the production of hydrogen gas, a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a6e068072704601a012ff971ab5fc"><name>2847</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Delivering the future: Innovation, entrepreneurship, sustainability</title><summary>Silicon Valley has long been a global center of innovation.

<p>The goal of the partnership is to create a prototype for an environmentally sustainable community and contribute to the economic vitality of the region, while providing a unique collaborative environment in which to deliver innovative education and research.</p>
<p>A March event at NASA Ames Research Park announcing the partnership was attended by university officials, scientists, engineers and Silicon Valley company leaders, in addition to Democratic Reps. Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto and Mike Honda and Zoe Lofgren, both of San Jose.</p>
<p>The project, which is to be developed on 75 acres of land in the NASA Research Park, will create jobs and drive private industry, said Eshoo.</p>
<p>"This partnership is important for our entire nation and will help to make this century an American century," Eshoo said.</p>
<p>This vision includes an integrated community featuring state-of-the-art research and teaching laboratories, shared classrooms, housing, accommodations for industrial partners, and modern infrastructure. Work on the site could begin as early as 2013, with initial occupancy as early as 2015.</p>
<p>"Our vision is to seed innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainability through the creative reuse of an important public asset for regional benefit," said UCSC chancellor George Blumenthal. "We aim to establish world-class programs and facilities dedicated to preparing the workforce of the future and to conducting research at the forefront of science and technology."</p>
<p>Designed to have a minimal carbon footprint, the community will serve as a model site to deploy and validate new renewable energy and resource conservation systems.</p>
<p>"Researchers, working together, will expedite development of emerging green technologies," Blumenthal said. "We will create knowledge, apply it to real-world challenges, and equip students to deliver results in the valley's burgeoning green-tech sector."</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University, Santa Clara University, and San Jose State University have also been involved in the early planning and may eventually join the partnership, said Joseph Miller, UCSC's vice provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives.</p>
<p>Development of the site, which is expected to cost more than $1 billion, would be undertaken through a public-private partnership.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a6f8f8072704601a012ff68846643"><name>2848</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores relations between universities and industry</title><summary>&lt;i&gt;Developing University-Industry Relations&lt;/i&gt; addresses the transfer of new discoveries and innovation from the research conducted at universities to the commercial sector.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Burney Le Boeuf, university-industry relations</keywords><description>&lt;i&gt;Developing University-Industry Relations&lt;/i&gt; addresses the transfer of new discoveries and innovation from the research conducted at universities to the commercial sector.</description><start-date>1239778800000</start-date><display-name>New book explores relations...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2848</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2848</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338877266</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338877266</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/cover.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/cover.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover.jpg</name><file-size>58966</file-size><width>200</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Developing University-Industry Relations</em> (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009) is a timely book written for campus leaders and business managers. Edited by Burney Le Boeuf, associate vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz, and Robert Miller, former vice chancellor for research at UCSC, the book addresses the transfer of new discoveries and innovation from the research conducted at universities to the commercial sector.</p>
<p>Mastering the relationship between universities and industry has never been more important than in today's turbulent economic environment. The knowledge-based economy continues to draw universities and businesses into close contact and provides significant mutual benefits to both.</p>
<p><em>Developing University-Industry Relations</em> draws on the experiences of some of the most renowned research universities on the U.S. West Coast and in Canada. Contributors include administrators from UC San Diego, Stanford University, University of Arizona, and University of Washington, in addition to UC Santa Cruz. The authors offer a wealth of exemplary best practices and proven strategies from forward-thinking institutions. The book shows what it takes to sustain strong university-industry collaborations that will allow for successful technology transfer.</p>
<p>"An important take-home message for most university administrators and faculty is that building long-term relationships with industry is more profitable than a strategy emphasizing financial returns from patent operations," Le Boeuf said.</p>
<p>The book explores industry-sponsored agreements that help to establish positive relationships, train students for the workforce, support faculty research, generate indirect-cost funds for infrastructure renewal, and deliver cutting-edge research to the sponsor. The book also describes successful approaches to software and copyright licensing and industry-sponsored consortia.</p>

<p>"These issues are strongly rooted in how people live," said Shakouri. "We need to make societal changes, and that's not something engineers and scientists typically know very much about."</p>
<p>To help bridge that gap, Shakouri launched his interdisciplinary <em>Renewable Energy</em> course in 2006. The course brought faculty and students from engineering, sociology, and other fields together to explore energy issues.</p>
<p>Shakouri then teamed up with four other faculty members-Ronnie Lipschutz (politics); Stephen Gliessman (environmental studies); Melanie Dupuis (sociology); and Ben Crow (sociology)-to offer <em>Sustainability Engineering and Practice</em> in 2007 and 2008. Together, they help students take a broader view of sustainability issues like energy, water, food, agroecology, transportation, and societal change.</p>
<p>"Social science students learn more about the science and the quantitative approaches they need to understand the delicate relationships between our energy use and its environmental impact; and engineering students get a broader view of how technologies might affect society," said Shakouri. Lipschutz and Shakouri recently received two grants from the National Science Foundation to expand a curriculum for a course in sustainability engineering and ecological design.</p>
<p>In summer 2008, Shakouri launched Lolland California Renewable Energies, an international educational exchange program (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2260">read more</a>). Twenty students from three UC campuses and two Danish universities learned about the implementation of sustainable energy technologies in Lolland, Denmark, including state-of-the-art offshore wind farms; in summer 2009 the program will be held in California.</p>

(Photo by Phil Carter)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>WEDNESDAY 10 A.M. The kale and beets sitting on a kitchen counter at College Eight, bursting with vivid purples and deep greens, were in the ground just an hour before.</p>
<p>"This is prime time for kale right now," said David Evershed, who had brought several boxes of organic produce from the UCSC Farm to College Eight Dining Hall's kitchen through the January chill.</p>
<p>"It gets super sweet in the cold," said the bearded young man, gesturing to a large, leafy bundle of kale with a knowing smile. "Like candy."</p>
<p>Evershed, a second-year apprentice with UCSC's <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a> (CASFS), is part of a grassroots movement started by students and encouraged by the campus's Dining Services unit to change the world one bite at a time.</p>
<p><a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/dining">Dining Services</a>, started in 2004 after the campus ended its contract with integrated food and facilities management giant Sodexo (previously Sodexho), has become one of the most cutting-edge campus food service divisions in the nation, constantly seeking out and incorporating innovative methods to increase sustainability and reduce waste.</p>
<p>The department has done so well with those twin goals since becoming self-operated, in fact, that it recently beat out more than 20 national competitors to win a $5,000 grant to invest in even more projects. In addition, UCSC's dining halls were ranked the nation's "greenest" by <em>Plenty</em> magazine, a major environmental publication. (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/article.asp?pid=2853">Read about</a> measures Dining Services has taken to increase sustainability.)</p>
<p>The effort has been rewarding, said Scott Berlin, director of Dining and Hospitality Services, and UCSC has the luck to be in its particular location-overlooking the rich farmland of the Pajaro and Salinas valleys, home to some of the most successful and productive organic farming operations in the country.</p>
<p>But the movement, he said, was student-generated and continues to be fueled by student energy.</p>
<p>"There's a significant amount of student interaction. It's a unique aspect," Berlin said. "These were student successes; we were just a willing vehicle."</p>
<h3>Roots of reform</h3>
<p>In 2003, the campus group Students for Organic Solutions brought together various stakeholders of the campus food system at the annual Earth Summit to discuss how to create sustainable change in the system, including purchasing organic produce from local farmers. At the same time, other students were expressing frustration with Sodexo's labor practices.</p>
<p>The discussions continued at the 2004 Earth Summit, and participants formed the Food Systems Working Group, which drafted purchasing guidelines for the campus that included buying local, certified organic, worker-supportive food products. After a six-month student campaign, UCSC ended its 30-year contract with Sodexo in June 2004.</p>
<p>Student-generated groundswell has, in fact, been at the heart of a sustainability movement for the entire UC system.</p>
<p>Many national reviews and assessments indicate that the system leads the higher-education pack in making big green changes, creating the most comprehensive and ambitious sustainability policy of any university system in the United States, according to the California Sustainability Alliance.</p>
<p>UC's path to leadership in sustainability was initiated by students who teamed up with the environmental group Greenpeace to bring together student activists, administrators, and faculty to tackle the lack of formal environmental awareness among the UC campuses.</p>
<p>Inspired by students' calls for action, the Board of Regents adopted a sustainability policy in 2003.</p>
<p>While UCSC's Dining Services unit is among those at the forefront of the campus sustainability movement, experts are seeing a trend toward sustainable food initiatives at universities and colleges across the nation.</p>
<p>"As institutions have committed to focusing on sustainability as a whole on campus, they are finally waking up to the fact that food is the one thing that connects all the issues surrounding sustainability: environmental, local economy, social issues, and, of course, the health and well-being of the people eating it," said John Turenne, president of consulting and technical-services company Sustainable Food Systems in Wallingford, Conn.</p>
<h3>Everybody eats</h3>
<p>Tim Galarneau (College Eight, '05) was a student in 2004, double majoring in psychology and community studies with an agroeceology/social justice emphasis. He was among those leading the student push for food sustainability and waste reduction, and he still is today as a staff member. He works as a food systems education and research program specialist at CASFS, and continues to help chair the Food Systems Working Group, which does education and outreach events on campus and works on sustainability, energy, and waste issues.</p>
<p>"Food is what really connects all of us," said Galarneau. "When I speak to groups, I ask them, 'How many of you out there eat?' It's a common equation-all of us eat, or would like to eat more than we do."</p>
<p>The United States' food system is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, said Galarneau.</p>
<p>"Not examining that is missing the point, and looking at it is a key part of planning, education, research, and problem-solving," he said. "I really wanted to carry that forward and share that excitement and enthusiasm and help people understand what they can do to shape the food system and their community."</p>
<p>In the run-up to Dining Services' self-operation, Galarneau and others worked with local organic farmers to form a syndicate, called the Monterey Bay Organic Farmers Consortium, which agreed to pool its goods and contract with the campus to provide locally grown organic produce. This contract was a first among the UC system's 10 campuses.</p>
<p>In addition to the 25-acre UCSC Farm, consortium farms include the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association, Coke Farm, Phil Foster Ranches, Happy Boy Farms, New Natives/Greensward Nurseries, and Swanton Berry Farm.</p>

<h4>Serving sustainability</h4>
<p>Over the past five years, UCSC Dining Services has taken a number of steps toward increased sustainability.</p>
<p><a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/article.asp?pid=2853">Read more &#187;</a></p>
</div>
Terminating the contract with Sodexo, creating an entirely new Dining Services department, developing purchasing guidelines, and forming a purchasing arrangement that met UC insurance, ordering, delivery, and invoicing requirements took "a lot of energy and work," said Galarneau. "But it felt great."<br/>
<p>It was a starting point too, he said. "Ultimately, it doesn't do any good to have sustainable food in a dining hall and have a consumer base that doesn't know what that means. It's about a change of consciousness, not just a change of diet."</p>
<h3>Opening the mind through the stomach</h3>
<p>The campus purchases 85 percent of its organic produce through the Monterey Bay Organic Farmers Consortium, according to Candy Berlin, program coordinator for Dining Services (who is married to Dining director Scott Berlin). Produce, both conventional and organic, in total makes up 21 percent of the unit's $7.2 million food budget.</p>
<p>So how are the primary consumers-students-reacting to the campus's initiatives on sustainable food and reducing waste?</p>
<p>"Students are overwhelmingly looking for this in businesses they deal with and universities and colleges they come to," said Candy Berlin. "From the clothing manufacturers they buy from to the autos they choose, this generation wants to know that those companies are doing the right thing."</p>
<p>Change can be challenging, though. The kale and beets may be fresh, local, and organic, but these are students we're talking about. On a recent day at the College Eight Dining Hall, most diners carried plates of those iconic foods beloved by students through the generations: burgers, fries, and pizza.</p>
<p>Sustainable and organic foods are "there, but on the periphery," said Abraham Rivas, 20, a Merrill College history major who was eating lunch on a recent weekday at College Eight.</p>
<p>Rivas had taken a small scoop of that day's organic, local vegetable offering-saut&#233;ed green beans with roasted turnips and beets-but said he generally chooses foods based on flavor.</p>
<p>"Whether it's organic or not makes a difference, but mostly it's the taste," Rivas said.</p>
<p>One problem is educating students about the "seasonality" of foods, according to Scott Berlin. Students are used to seeing a huge array of foods in the marketplace and often do not understand that crops produced locally may be limited. But with ongoing education and marketing, the awareness of the relationship between food and the world we live in can only grow, he said.</p>
<p>On the waste front, each year Dining holds several "Zero Waste" events to bring attention to minimizing the campus's carbon footprint. Uneaten food scraps are collected during these events and weighed. From one recent audit, Dining learned that 106,050 pounds of potential food waste is created annually during the lunch period of just one of the five dining halls on campus.</p>
<p>These "waste audits" educate students on what taking more than they can really eat adds up to, said Scott Berlin.</p>
<p>"People are really disappointed during the audits when they see how much gets wasted," said fourth-year student Jennifer Pimentel, 22, who is serving an environmental services internship with College Eight.</p>
<p>And that leads to perhaps Dining Services' biggest opportunity of all: the chance to open thousands of young minds every year as the importance of minimizing human impact on the planet becomes increasingly urgent. The hope is that UCSC students will take what they learn at the dining halls out into the world and spread those ideals in a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Though organic foods are too expensive for him to purchase at the moment, student Rivas thinks his eating habits have changed during his years at UCSC.</p>
<p>"There are so many more things I'd like to try," Rivas said. "I'm definitely more open-minded-even to things that sound really bad, like tofu."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a77ea8072704601a012ff05043168"><name>2853</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Serving sustainability</title><summary>UCSC Dining Services has taken many steps over the past five years to increase sustainability.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><description>UCSC Dining Services has taken many steps over the past five years to increase sustainability.</description><start-date>1239951600000</start-date><display-name>Serving sustainability...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2853</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2853</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338879416</created-on><last-modified-by>nespatel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319062260302</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/dining_hall.340.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/dining_hall.340.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dining_hall.340.jpg</name><file-size>37468</file-size><width>340</width><height>257</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Eliminating trays is one way Dining Services has reduced waste and saved water. (Photo by Phil Carter)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over the past five years, UCSC Dining Services has taken a number of steps toward increased sustainability, including the following:</p>
<p>. Dining Services teamed up with PG&amp;E to replace old lighting with more energy-efficient alternatives, saving nearly $10,000 annually. A $26,500 rebate from PG&amp;E will fund future sustainable Dining Services projects.</p>
<p>. Installation of 56 Energy Star-rated appliances has cut most department energy costs in half.</p>
<p>. Elimination of all food trays is saving an estimated 30,000 gallons of water a month while reducing water-heating costs and the use of cleaning chemicals. Food waste per plate has been cut by more than 40 percent-significant, since Dining Services serves more than 11,000 meals per day.</p>
<p>. Thanks to a pilot composting program (collecting kitchen scraps from four dining halls and transporting to the Vision Recycling composting project at Buena Vista Landfill in Watsonville), Dining Services diverted nearly 30 tons of food scraps from the landfill between August 15 and December 1, 2008. Campus recycling has been instrumental in collection, transportation to the landfill, and supporting educational outreach.</p>
<p>. Compostable paper products and flatware made from corn or potatoes-100 percent biodegradable and compostable-have replaced traditional disposables.</p>
<p>. Vegetable and meat scraps are used for soup stock, and grease, fat, and French-fry oil are recycled for other purposes, such as biodiesel fuel. Other perishable food is donated to a local food bank. When food must be thrown away, it is converted to slurry with a pulper, reducing cubic yards of waste collected in dumpsters by two-thirds.</p>
<p>. All campus dining halls and retail locations brew Community Agroecology Network (CAN) coffee daily. An innovative project between the campus and coffee growers, CAN creates a fair-trade market and collaborates with farmers to improve local, sustainable farming practices.</p>
<p>. Cage-free eggs are available at all dining halls and retail locations.</p>
<p>. Nine campus dining locations are "green" certified by the Monterey Bay Area Green Business Program, and two more sites are being inspected and certified. To be certified "green," participants must be in compliance with program regulations and meet standards for conserving resources, preventing pollution, and minimizing waste.</p>
<p>. Other sustainable practices under consideration include using reusable containers for all to-go meals; investigating more vegetarian-based menu items; installing self-service water-bottle refill stations to reduce the use of disposable plastic water bottles on campus; and installing solar-powered trash compactors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a79598072704601a012ff8f4c148f"><name>2854</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A sustaining vision</title><summary>Planners have maintained the characteristics of the campus's extraordinary site while fulfilling the academic mission.</summary><description>Planners have maintained the characteristics of the campus's extraordinary site while fulfilling the academic mission.</description><start-date>1239951600000</start-date><display-name>A sustaining vision...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2854</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2854</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338879775</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338879775</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/zwart_frank.340.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/zwart_frank.340.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zwart_frank.340.jpg</name><file-size>40553</file-size><width>340</width><height>228</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Campus architect Frank Zwart standing at the top of the Great Meadow on campus.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Frank Zwart was a student at UC Santa Cruz in the late '60s, he and his friends would gather for full-moon picnics on the site where the Theater Arts Center stands today. There were few permanent buildings then-the campus had just opened in 1965-and those first pioneering students came to know intimately the meadows, forests, and ravines of the campus.</p>
<p><a class="button file image" href="http://review.ucsc.edu/slideshow">View a slideshow of the campus »</a></p>
<p>By the time Zwart graduated in 1971, the campus core was beginning to take shape, guided by the principles developed by nationally known architects and landscape architects. The planners sought to weave UCSC's unique academic plan with its extraordinary site, following a few overarching guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>The setting would remain simple and natural, with landscape refinement restricted to the college and academic courtyards.</li>
<li>There would be a core of larger academic and common buildings surrounded by smaller-scale colleges.</li>
<li>Each building would be designed individually with respect for its distinct academic mission and its particular setting.</li>
<li>Ravines and wildlife corridors would be conserved.</li>
<li>Meadows would remain open to protect views.</li>
<li>Buildings would mingle with the trees at the forest edge.</li>
</ul>
Zwart returned to UCSC in 1985 to take a job as project manager in the campus architect's office. He became part of the team guiding the campus through a period of significant growth, adding colleges and developing the density of the academic core.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Today Zwart is associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction-leading an international team of campus architects and planners who continue to integrate the early planning principles into a sustainable vision.</p>

Since that time, UCSC has taken great strides to improve safety and security on our campus and our ability to respond to both man-made and natural emergencies.</p><p>At the beginning of the Fall 2008 Quarter, UCSC implemented the CruzAlert emergency notification system, which allows critical information to be rapidly distributed via telephone, cell phone, text messaging and e-mail in the event of a major campus emergency. CruzAlert messages are intended to provide information on actions that need to be taken immediately by students, faculty and staff to protect themselves during such events.</p><p>If you have not already done so, I strongly encourage you to register your cell phone, home phone and other phone numbers or e-mail addresses with CruzAlert so that you can receive these important messages. Other than periodic system testing, we will not use this information for any purposes other than to communicate with you during campus emergencies. You can sign-up by going to <a href="http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu">http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu</a> and following the instructions for either students or faculty/staff.</p><p>On Friday, May 1, 2009, the campus will conduct a test of both the e-mail and the text messaging capabilities of CruzAlert. During these tests, e-mails will be sent via CruzAlert to all campus e-mail addresses and text messages will be sent to all registered cell phone numbers. Due to the vendor system used to send CruzAlert messages, the e-mails will show as coming from various numeric e-mail addresses in the @notify2.mir3.com domain and the text messages will show as coming from a 5-digit number. If you are concerned about the validity of these messages, contact the ITS Help Desk at 9-4357.</p><p>If you do plan to register or change your cell phone number in advance of this test, please do so no later than Tuesday, April 28, 2009 at 5:00pm. We cannot guarantee that changes made after this time will be properly uploaded before the test occurs. Also, if you do receive a text message on your cell phone, please reply to the message with the number "1" only in the message body to verify receipt. Due to the way text messaging works, we are unable to verify message delivery beyond transmission to the cell phone carrier without your response, so this is critical in testing the effectiveness of the system. If for some reason you do not receive a message and do have a text-enabled cell phone registered, please e-mail <a href="mailto:alert@ucsc.edu">alert@ucsc.edu</a> with your name and your cell phone number so that we take the necessary follow-up actions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chris Gaylord, Emergency Manager, UCSC Fire

Timbuktu to witness how climate change is forcing nomadic tribes to give up their wandering lives for a more sedentary existence.</p>
<p>He has climbed the ice-shrouded Mt. Erebus in Antarctica to watch a volcanologist at work and stood beside a charismatic Maasai named Samuel Pilipili as the man administered daily doses of tuberculosis medicine to fellow tribe members in Kenya in an effort to cut the disease's deadly toll.</p>
<p>All of this was done, not for adventure, but to help people learn about scientific discoveries and challenges in our world today.</p>
<p>"I like to tell stories to help people understand what kind of a place we live in and the interesting things scientists are doing," said Harris, an award-winning science correspondent for National Public Radio and a 1980 Crown College graduate. "So many decisions as a society are based on understanding science. To the extent we can understand science more, we can make better decisions."</p>
<p>Curious by nature, the biology major found himself drawn to journalism while taking a science writing course at UCSC from John Wilkes. Reporting satisfied his eclectic interest in science. "Every place I looked interested me," he said.</p>
<p>Harris worked for the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> before being hired in 1986 at NPR, where stories have taken him from the sides of lake-swallowing holes in Greenland to the eerily empty streets of Beijing during the height of the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"What drives me is my own thirst for knowledge," said Harris in a telephone interview from his cubicle in NPR's Washington, D.C., offices. "It's my own desire to find solutions," he said-to help people think about their personal lives on this delicately balanced planet.</p>
<p>Unassuming on the phone, the 51-year-old Harris talks easily about the people he has met but is more reticent about himself, although he admits to being in training for a 100-mile bike ride. He also is looking forward, he said, to doing more stories about how we can shift our lives in the face of climate change and how our oceans are undergoing major alterations, including acidification.</p>

<p>She saw the determination of her hardworking parents, both high school dropouts, who saved their money and opened a jewelry store in the agricultural town of Santa Maria, Calif.</p>
<p>"My parents taught me never to give up," said Cervantes, a slim 21-year-old senior with dark eyes who avoided the gangs that peppered her town and instead turned to sports such as soccer and softball, earning a black belt in Tae Kwan Do as a youngster. Her parents and sister have tirelessly supported her, she said.</p>
<p>She also took inspiration from a cousin, Josue Medrano, who has been wheelchair-bound since childhood with cerebral palsy but became one of the first in his family to go to a university, earning a master's degree from UC Irvine. He encouraged Cervantes to study hard at Santa Maria High, where almost 25 percent of students drop out and only 4 percent go to a four-year college.</p>
<p>"He told me, 'You can do whatever you want,'" Cervantes said.</p>
<p>So, even though academics were a struggle, the shy Cervantes signed up for Advanced Placement classes and joined the soccer team. Her acceptance to UCSC "was a huge accomplishment for me."</p>
<p>At College Eight, Cervantes discovered another family. As a residential adviser, she found herself helping students with their problems and becoming a leader. She was named to the Student Committee on Committees and the Student Fee Advisory Committee. She helped put on a multicultural event that drew 500 students, and she joined the Latino Business Student Association.</p>
<p>In 2008, Cervantes was given a College Service Award from UCSC's Alumni Association, which included a $500 scholarship supported by membership in the organization.</p>
<p>The award was important for Cervantes, not only to demonstrate that a shy young woman had come so far, but also to help finance her final quarters at school after the recent economic downturn and her parents' divorce left her struggling financially. But Cervantes is determined to get her degree in sociology and eventually work for Child Protective Services before becoming a child psychologist.</p>
<p>It will be a way, she said, to help children who do not have what she had: a family.</p>

<p>"I asked him why he wanted to have the machine there, and he said because he wanted to go to college," said Vargas; then he laughed. "I didn't even want it in my shop."</p>
<p>But, Vargas said, he could see a determination and intelligence in the boy, and so he agreed. "I told him, 'I think you're going to go far.'"</p>
<p>Six years later that boy, Ezequiel Olvera, had 40 gum and soda vending machines in shops around East L.A. and an acceptance letter to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>At UCSC, the now six-foot Olvera got a job as a campus tour guide despite being self-conscious about his background in front of the dignitaries he met. One of them, the sister of then Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, was so impressed, she encouraged Olvera to get an internship with the California Commission for Economic Development. Olvera, a business management and economics major at Oakes College, seemed to be fulfilling Vargas's predictions.</p>
<p>But then trouble intervened. The fianc&#233; of one of Olvera's sisters died and then she suffered a paralyzing stroke. His father was also having a hard time. Duty made Olvera take time off from college, although he didn't tell anyone his reason for leaving.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be seen as a weakness," said Olvera, now 25. "But it was just part of life."</p>
<p>Discouraged, Olvera went home but saw an opportunity to work in Antonio Villaraigosa's L.A. mayoral campaign. There, he met labor leader Dolores Huerta, who encouraged him to not lose sight of his dreams.</p>
<p>Olvera eventually returned to UCSC, where he founded the Latino Business Student Association and then, after graduation, landed a job with a major accounting firm in San Francisco. But drawn to Barack Obama's historic campaign, Olvera quit his job to work for the candidate. Now he is helping spearhead a friend's congressional campaign.</p>
<p>Remembering the lessons he learned at UCSC, Olvera became a lifetime member of the Alumni Association.</p>
<p>"For me, it is a big benefit to be part of a large network of people that I can reach out to in the future," Olvera said. "And, I think it is very important to give back."</p>

They described their findings in a <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000390">paper</a> published by <i>PLoS Pathogens</i> on April 17.</p><p>"The loss of copper regulation may play a very important role in prion disease progression," said Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC and corresponding author of the paper. </p><p>Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative brain disorders caused by a misfolded form of the normal cellular prion protein. Human prion diseases include classic and variant types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The vast majority of CJD cases are sporadic, meaning they are thought to arise from spontaneous misfolding of the prion protein. Infectious transmission of the prion accounts for a very small percentage of cases, while about 10 percent of cases are caused by inherited defects in the structure of the prion protein. </p><p>Millhauser and his coauthors studied the effects of insertional mutations that cause extra sequences of eight amino acids (known as the octarepeat sequence) to be incorporated into the prion protein. Whereas the normal prion protein has four octarepeat segments, insertional mutations can result in as many as nine additional octarepeats. The extra octarepeats change the properties of the prion protein and eventually lead to the progressive brain damage characteristic of CJD. </p><p>These insertional mutations are known from a small number of cases reported in the literature, involving about 30 families and 108 individuals. Reviews of these cases have suggested that higher numbers of inserts are associated with earlier-age onset of the disease. </p><p>The octarepeat domain takes up copper ions, which are essential for the proper functioning of neurons. Millhauser's lab looked at the effects of insertional mutations on the prion protein's ability to bind copper. Graduate student Daniel Stevens, lead author of the paper, and postdoctoral researcher Eric Walter performed experiments using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study how prion proteins with different numbers of octarepeats interact with copper.</p><p>The normal prion protein responds dynamically to varying concentrations of copper by changing the way it binds the metal, allowing it to soak up more copper ions at higher concentrations. When the researchers studied proteins with octarepeat inserts, however, they found that the protein loses this ability to switch binding modes as the number of inserts increases beyond four.</p><p>"We got excited when we saw that the threshold in the effects on copper binding corresponds to the threshold for age of onset that was seen in the clinical studies," Millhauser said. </p><p>The average age of onset is 64 years for patients with one to four extra repeats, but for patients with five to nine inserts the average age of onset drops to 38 years. Similarly, Millhauser's group found a transition in the copper-binding properties of the protein that occurred between four and five inserts, the same threshold observed for early-onset disease.</p><p>For the statistical analysis of clinical cases, Millhauser enlisted the help of statisticians David Draper and Abel Rodriguez, professors of applied mathematics and statistics in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC. Draper and Rodriguez used several approaches to analyze the pooled data from case studies in the literature. Their results are consistent with the existence of two groups of patients: a group with one to four extra octarepeats and late-onset disease, and a group with five or more inserts and early-onset disease.</p><p>The normal function of the prion protein remains uncertain, but the new findings support the idea that it plays a role in the regulation of copper ions in the brain, Millhauser said. The prion protein is anchored to the outside of the cell membranes of neurons and is concentrated at the synapses, the junctions between neurons where signals are transmitted. The concentration of copper in the synapses is dynamic, and as the copper concentration goes up and down the prion protein switches from one copper-binding mode to another. Millhauser suspects that the prion protein soaks up excess copper ions to protect brain cells from harmful reactions.</p><p>"The prion protein goes into a neuroprotective mode at higher levels of copper, and that mode gets lost when extra octarepeats are added to the protein structure," he said.</p><p>While changes in copper binding begin to appear with four or more extra octarepeats, other changes in the molecular properties of the prion protein occur with as few as one insert. These changes include an increased propensity to clump together and form protein deposits in brain tissue. </p><p>Research on prion diseases has tended to focus on these aggregates and deposits, which are thought to have toxic effects on brain cells. But the strong relationship between changes in copper binding and clinical progression of the disease suggests that more attention should be given to the normal function of the prion protein, Millhauser said. </p><p>"The fundamental issue may be the loss of copper regulation, and excess copper may be what causes the cytotoxicity," he said. </p><p>In addition to Millhauser, Stevens, Walter, Rodriguez, and Draper, the coauthors of the <i>PLoS Pathogens</i> paper include Paul Davies and David Brown of the University of Bath.

The program--the Network Management and Operations (NMO) Lab--has been a big hit at both Cisco and UCSC, according to Brad Smith, adjunct professor of computer engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering.  </p><p>"Some of the students have told me it was a life-changing experience to have that real-world connection to what they're learning," Smith said. "And the students have been a big success at Cisco. As word spread within Cisco, the program has begun growing faster than we expected."</p><p>Space and staff support for the NMO Lab are provided by the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), of which UC Santa Cruz is a member. CITRIS, a partnership between four UC campuses and 60 corporations, looks at information technology in terms of solutions to the world's most pressing social, environmental, and health problems. By providing Baskin and Cisco the physical space and management for operating the NMO Lab, CITRIS enables Baskin students and faculty to create networking innovations.</p><p>The Baskin program was initiated by Joe Pinto, senior vice president for technical services at Cisco. Pinto has worked to strengthen relationships between universities and the high-tech industry for a long time. To celebrate Cisco's partnership with Baskin Engineering, Pinto will deliver the final talk of the academic year in Baskin's Distinguished Lecture series: "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2836">Engineering Smart and Web-based Systems to Support Customers in a Global Economy</a>."</p><p>The creation of the NMO Lab and Cisco's earlier gift of a teaching laboratory for the Computer Networks course have led to curriculum changes at Baskin, according to Smith.  A lab component now accompanies the Computer Networks and Network Administration courses. The NMO Lab and the opportunities to work with Cisco make it possible for Baskin to teach these courses annually, and enrollments are increasing each term, Smith said.</p><p>Currently, about 10 undergraduates and several graduate students are involved in Cisco projects. For the undergraduates, it is a funded internship, made possible by Cisco. For graduate students, the Cisco-funded graduate-student research stipend supports their work on real-world problems they can address in master's theses. Through their projects, the students are able to earn entry-level Cisco certification for networking technicians. </p><p>"This is a great example of the kinds of partnerships and collaborations that the Baskin School of Engineering is establishing with Silicon Valley industry. We're very pleased to have Cisco as our partner," Smith said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a883f8072704601a012ffb9d45705"><name>2863</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Your turn</title><summary>A sampling of reader reaction to recent issues of the UC Santa Cruz Review.

<strong>notes &amp; errata:</strong> <em>Review neglected to credit worldle.net in the winter 2008-09 issue (pictured). We used the online application to create the word collage that formed the basis of that issue's cover design. We regret the omission.</em><br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Dwindling oil</strong></p>

<p>I hope you were serious when you asked what we think the new president should do ("Mr. President .," fall 2008).</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I was pleased with the thoughtful advice the faculty members offered our new president, but I was dismayed that none of them mentioned the main crisis facing the new administration: What to do about waning global petroleum resources. Why is no one talking about this?</p>
<p>Here would be my advice to the new president: Come clean with all Americans. Admit that we are in a period of declining oil resources, and technology in and of itself will not save us. Admit that our standard of living cannot be sustained, and admit that global population growth is out of control. Then start looking for alternative energy sources and the technology that will give us access to them, not to expand or even maintain our living standard but to bridge the transition period to a lower, sustainable standard.</p>
<p><em>James Pesout, father of Trevor, '10, and Sarah Pesout, '12</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections on Kapany</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the story "Celebrating innovation, ideas, and ideals" (winter 2008-09).</p>
<p>I completed a course taught by Narinder Kapany during the winter quarter of 1980 at UC Santa Cruz. This economics course provided insight into the innovation and entrepreneurial processes for students contemplating careers in the business or technical sector. We also learned about "total internal reflection," the scientific concept that made Kapany famous for his research that demonstrated light could be passed through bent optical fibers without any loss of transmission.</p>
<p><em>Paris Everett Merriam, College Eight, '81</em></p>
<p><strong>You say you want a revolution</strong></p>
<p>Millions and millions of dollars...from wealthy donors to UCSC.</p>
<p>Why doesn't UCSC funnel some of those millions you receive and build an Earth center on the campus? So we can save (what's left of) our planet!</p>
<p>It's time for a global green revolution.</p>
<p><em>Steve Jones, College Eight, '84</em></p>

</div>
<strong>Save the barn</strong> <br/>
<br/>

<p>Is there a plan to demolish the barn at the entrance to the campus? That is what seems implied in the story of Sam the goat in the winter 2008-09 issue ("Your Turn").</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I think that historic buildings like the remains of the Cowell Ranch give a three-dimensional picture of history. By preserving them we understand better where we are and where we are going.</p>
<p><em>Tom Fagan, Porter, '78</em></p>
<p><strong>ed. note:</strong> <em>The letter writer simply meant that time and the elements are taking their toll on the barn, not that there's any plan to tear it down. However, a new group on campus, Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District (<a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu">limeworks.ucsc.edu</a>), is working to restore the buildings in the historic lime-producing area near the base of campus.</em></p>

Frank Black, who is measuring mercury levels in water, fish, and hair of subsistence fishermen in Botswana; James Casey, who is conducting research on early 20th century Arab newspapers in Syria; Timothy Krupnik, who is researching farming systems to improve rice production and natural resource conservation in Senegal; Michelle Olsgard, who is investigating the sustainability of a fungus important to Chinese traditional medicine on the Tibetan Plateau; Elizabeth Orr, who is studying the impact of global warming on insect populations in Sweden; Leah Samberg, who is researching the effects of a rapidly growing population on the biodiversity and sustainability of the agroecosystem of the Ethiopian highlands; and Anna Zivian, who is addressing the growing trend of environmental policy and politics and being contested at the local level in Austria.</p><p><h3>How kids learn to 'think like scientists'</h3> </p><p>Thousands of years after roaming the riverbeds of what is now downtown San Jose, a juvenile mammoth will get new life inspiring a generation of young visitors to Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose.</p><p>As the museum develops an exhibit around the remains of the mammoth, UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Maureen Callanan is gearing up for a major research project that will explore the ways children learn to use evidence and figure out answers to questions in everyday life.</p><p>In other words, how they learn to "think like scientists," said Callanan.</p><p>The project is a collaboration among Children's Discovery Museum, UCSC, and the Museum of Paleontology at UC Berkeley, with funding from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>Callanan, who has collaborated with Children's Discovery Museum for nearly a decade, is also helping designers plan the new exhibit. Scheduled to open in 2011, it will feature a life-sized model of the full mammoth, as well as some of the fossilized remains.</p><p><h3>Big bang</h3></p><p>UC Santa Cruz is the top-ranking university in the country for the quality of its research in astronomy and astrophysics, according to a recent analysis of papers published in scientific journals and how often those papers are cited by other scientists.</p><p>The analysis, performed by a top NASA scientist, Anne Kinney, used a combination of approaches to look at the impact of published work on the science of astronomy and astrophysics. Kinney said she undertook the study to help prospective graduate students evaluate departments that offer graduate degrees in astronomy. Kinney reported her findings in a paper, "The Science Impact of Astronomy Ph.D. Granting Departments in the United States."</p><p>"Competition for the best graduatestudents is fierce, and we compete against the very best institutions in the world," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research, "so it's important to be able to show that the quality and impact of our research is first-rate."</p><p><h3>Chancellor emeritus honored at Scholarship Benefit Dinner</h3></p><p>Town and gown got together in January to show their support for students at the campus's annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner. </p><p>The event spotlighted the role of Chancellor Emeritus Karl S. Pister and his wife, Rita Olsen Pister (pictured with Chancellor Blumenthal), in increasing support for undergraduate scholarships-with special focus on the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards. This year's benefit dinner drew more than 300 guests and raised over $165,000 for scholarships.</p><p><h3>Green-collar economy focus of keynote address at King Convocation</h3> </p><p>Green entrepreneur, urban advocate, and author Van Jones was the keynote speaker at the 25th annual UCSC Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation in February. Jones spoke to a crowd of more than 2,000 gathered at the Civic Auditorium about the need to move to a "green economy" and simultaneously conquer poverty. Here, Jones talks with students before the convocation.</p><p><h3>Cabrera, Richards, Rickford win top honors</h3> </p><p>The common thread running through the Alumni Association's top award winners for 2008-09 is their exceptional ability to inspire. </p><p>The award winners are: Outstanding Staff Award: Rosalee ("Rosie") Cabrera, director, El Centro Chicano Latino Student Resource Center; Distinguished Teaching Award: Alan Richards, professor, environmental studies; Alumni Achievement Award: John Rickford (Stevenson '71), professor, linguistics, Stanford University. Cabrera and Richards, who will receive $500 each, will be honored at the new all-alumni reunion picnic on Saturday, April 25. </p><p>Rickford will be honored at the campus's Founders Day celebration in October.</p><p>Cabrera has worked at UCSC for 24 years in a variety of positions, including as a counselor at the Educational Opportunity Program.</p><p>Richards has taught for 32 years, first in the Economics Department and more recently in Environmental Studies. His experience living in the Middle East and working at the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Agency for International Development informs his teaching, as does his interdisciplinary approach to scholarship.

</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For some, retirement means slowing down and shifting gears. </p><p>Not so for Thomas F. Pettigrew, a research professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz who just received a UC-wide award for accomplishments since retirement.</p><p>"I've published more in the last 10 years than any decade of my life," said Pettigrew, a joyful 70-something who, by way of explanation, noted with glee, "No interruptions!"</p><p>Pettigrew, an internationally renowned expert on racism and intergroup relations, has received the University of California's 2008/09 <a href="http://www.gdnet.ucla.edu/deans/library/panunzio.htm">Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award</a>. The honor marks the third time a UCSC retiree was selected, and the second time in three years. G. William Domhoff, a research professor of psychology and sociology, received the 2006/07 award, and Hayden White of history of consciousness was a recipient in 2000/01. Pettigrew shares this year's award with Daniel Walker Howe, professor emeritus of history at UCLA.</p><p>"As Tom Pettigrew's outstanding work demonstrates, the extraordinary engagement of our emeriti faculty reflects the passion they bring to their work--a passion that for many does not wane when they leave the classroom," said Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p><p>For more than five decades, Pettigrew has been a leader in the field of social psychology. His research focuses on unlocking the mechanisms of racism, and his scholarly contributions since his official retirement in 1994 continue to shape the field.</p><p>"I'd rather be doing this than almost anything else," said Pettigrew, who continues to travel extensively with his wife, Ann. "I just accepted an invitation to attend a conference in Spain in October. My wife loves Spain."</p><p>The author of more than 300 scholarly articles and book chapters, as well as nearly 100 book reviews, Pettigrew recently published a highly influential <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/02-03/03-10/prejudice.html">meta-analysis</a> of the scholarly research on the value of contact for reducing prejudice. Evaluating more than 500 studies of intergroup contact from around the world--between blacks and whites, as well as between straights and gays, deaf and hearing individuals, and blind and sighted people--led Pettigrew and coauthor Linda Tropp of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to the powerful conclusion that interacting with members of other groups does reduce prejudice. "In only 6 percent of the 515 studies did we see an increase in prejudice," said Pettigrew. "The principle is really there."</p><p>The meta-analysis, published just three years ago and already considered a classic in social psychology, triggered a surge in research by investigators eager to shed more light on the dynamics. "That study gave people the confidence that there's really a phenomenon here," said Pettigrew. "Now the question is why. Why does contact reduce prejudice? I've been working on that, and so have a couple hundred other people."</p><p>So far, Pettigrew and Tropp have discovered that intergroup contact reduces anxiety and increases empathy, which contribute nearly equally to declines in prejudice. </p><p>Pettigrew grew up in the South and taught at Harvard University for many years before relocating to Santa Cruz in 1979 and formally joining the UCSC faculty in 1980. He has spent much of the last two decades focusing his research on intergroup relations in Western Europe, where immigrants from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have been the target of growing racism and ethnic prejudice. In 2006, he traveled to <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/pettigrew.asp">South Africa</a> to mark the 50th anniversary of his first visit there with his mentor, pioneering social psychologist Gordon Allport. </p><p>Highly honored for his scholarly contributions, Pettigrew has twice received the prestigious Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. He has also received lifetime achievement awards from the American Sociological Association, the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, and the International Academy for Intercultural Research. Last year, he received the UCSC Social Science Division's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2094">Distinguished Emeriti Award</a>, and earlier this month he delivered the campus's <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2799">Emeriti Faculty Lecture</a>, an annual event sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor.</p><p>The Constantine Panunzio Award, which carries a $5,000 prize, was created in 1983 by a bequest from Panunzio, a UCLA sociology professor who has been described as the architect of the UC Retirement System, as well as an early writer on the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. The award honors outstanding scholarly work and/or educational service since retirement by UC faculty emeriti in the humanities or social sciences. Nominations are submitted to each campus's emeriti association, reviewed by campus provosts, and presented to a board of directors that selects the recipient(s).</p><p>Pettigrew's fellow recipient, Daniel Walker Howe, is the author of <i>What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815-1848</i>, a masterpiece of historical narrative that won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for History and the American History Prize of the New York Historical Society.

It's a good place to watch the sunset and unwind from a stressful day of classes.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b> </p><p>It has changed the way I see myself and the world.

Hilde was always very open to helping anyone in the class, always had handouts and supplemental material provided for you, and often gave out candy. What more could you want?</p><p> </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>My most memorable experience has occurred very recently. This year I have joined an Argentine Tango Society on campus and it has been the best thing I've done with UCSC in the last four years. I've met some really great, friendly people and I get to dance a few times every week.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>My favorite spot on campus are the tennis courts at the East Field House. I have played tennis there every quarter, either because I was taking the advanced tennis class through OPERS or practicing with the tennis club.</p><p> </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>Geez, hard question. Through the last four years, I've become a person who is relaxed and calm, but understands what needs to be done and when it needs to be done in order to get the task accomplished in time. The open-minded state of UCSC has broadened my views of a lot of topics. </p><p> </p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>Next year I will be a graduate student in the Earth Sciences Department under a one-year masters program. So after hopefully receiving my masters, I will apply for jobs in either the private sector with geotechnical consulting or do some museum work in the field of paleontology.</p><p> </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>My life as a Crown student did not have a strong effect on me. The core class I took my first quarter of freshman year was great. I really enjoyed it. But I don't think it affected my education one way or another. And I only maintained one friend from when I lived in the dorms at Crown. So I think being a Crownie did not affect me much.</p><p> </p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>My biggest accomplishment, outside of graduating UCSC, has been my work with the Disability Alliance. For the past two years, I have been president of the alliance, which is run by students with disabilities. I helped create this club four years ago in part to create an example for other students with disabilities--to show them that a disability doesn't have to hinder your performance, especially if you play to your strengths. Last winter we had our main event, a Disability Awareness Fair, where we educate passersby about different types of disabilities such as learning, physical, mental, etc., in order to slowly help destigmatize disabilities and erase stereotypes. As a student with learning disabilities who is not afraid of the stereotypes, I have been trying to show over the last four years that other students with disabilities don't have to be afraid either. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915a9e568072704601a012ff5905c525"><name>2874</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation Picnic Tuesday, May 12th</title><summary>Staff picnic</summary><keywords>staff picnic</keywords><description>Staff picnic</description><start-date>1240297200000</start-date><display-name>Staff Appreciation Picnic Tuesday,...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2874</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2874</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338889226</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338889226</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Please join the Staff Advisory Board and Chancellor George Blumenthal for the Staff Appreciation Picnic on Tuesday, May 12th, from 11:30-1:30 p.m. on the East Field (OPERS).</p><p>This is an opportunity to express appreciation for the great work staff contributes to the campus throughout the year.

Dominy. The first course was <i>Human Functional Anatomy</i> in spring 2008. Though it was a lot of work for even a 10-unit class, I loved the material, and learning about the human body was ideal for my interests in forensic anthropology and primate comparative biology. We were able to work with both human and nonhuman primate cadavers as well as many casts from famous fossil hominins. Some thought working with the bodies was gross, but I loved it and was always fascinated. The second course was this winter quarter, <i>Field Methods in Primatology.</i> In this class we not only developed our own studies, but were able to go to Costa Rica for three weeks to conduct our research. It was amazing to get credit for being in the tropical rain forest with all the primates every day. Professor Dominy is great and has helped me out a lot with my own independent research, which I conducted while I was abroad in South Africa this past fall. He always has great advice and is supportive of his students' interests.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>Studying abroad in South Africa for six months. Living in a culture with such well-known history and a background so different from anything I have directly experienced was an amazing learning experience. I made so many wonderful friends and tried so many new things it would be hard to elaborate on everything.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>When I lived on campus, I loved walking from College Nine to the Music Center. On really sunny, breezy days the air would be so clear you could see across the bay to Monterey. It is a nice place to do readings for class, and most of the time you can hear a music class nearby practicing or students playing their instruments.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>UCSC, being a very socially conscious campus, has rubbed off on me in many ways. It has made me more involved in the community in which I live by being an RA for College Nine for two years and using the leadership position to help students to be more aware of the effect their actions have on others. I've always been open-minded, but having the support network of UCSC students who are equally open-minded has made me more vocal about my opinions or confronting those who many not be totally conscious of their own words or actions.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>I plan on going to graduate school for a Ph.D. in anthropology but have not decided where. I am taking the next year off to work, volunteer, and research what programs are applicable to what I want to do.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>Like I said, I was a community leader at College Nine and was involved in all the activities and programs centered around the theme of International and Global Perspectives. This inspired me to study abroad to fully understand the way things work outside the United States and to experience something completely different. In South Africa, I learned so much more than I ever could just being in a classroom. It was the best experience I had in college, and being on my own in a place so different really made me a stronger person.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b> </p><p>I conducted my own research in the field of anthropology on the subject of early hominin diet. This research began by collecting edible plants in South Africa, bring the samples to the Smithsonian Museum Support Center in Maryland for analysis, and finally to Costa Rica for comparative studies on primates. I submitted this research for the Dean's and Chancellor's award on April 10, but will not know until later if I am chosen.</p><p>Also, my professor, Nate Dominy, nominated me for honors in anthropology for my work in the senior seminar. This will be voted on by a faculty committee and announced closer to graduation.</p><p>I will be receiving College Nine Distinction for actively participating in the theme for all four years and studying abroad.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915aa6be8072704601a012ff0b6baeb9"><name>2879</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Jewish Studies Distinguished Lecture and Alumni Conference this weekend--April 24, 26</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>jewish studies, alumni, james e. young, memorials, museums, author, holocaust, conference</keywords><start-date>1240470000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Jewish Studies Distinguished...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2879</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2879</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338891398</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338891398</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/james_young_copy_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/james_young_copy_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>james_young_copy_300.jpg</name><file-size>30533</file-size><width>300</width><height>461</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>James E.

In those classes, I was able to discover that I have a passion for writing and journalism, and inspired me to continue working for <i>City on a Hill Press.</i> Susan has been an amazing teacher and mentor over the years, and has helped me use my experiences to help teach others.</p><p> </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>As hard as it is to choose, one of the more memorable experiences came last year, when I was trying to get some sleep. I was living with four of my close friends that year, and they came back slightly tipsy and ready for adventure, and somehow managed to drag me out of bed. We decided to walk from our house, across the San Lorenzo River, up to campus in time for the sunrise. Four hours later, after more than one detour, we made it to the benches overlooking East Field just in time to see the sun peek over the hills.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>As cliché as it sounds, my favorite spot on campus is the area around the Press Center, where we produced <i>City on a Hill.</i> I spent so many hours there that I have an emotional connection with the place. Last year it became every more perfect, with the Back Perch coffee shop opening next door, and I really didn't ever have any reason to leave. It also has one of the most fantastic views on campus, and nobody knows about it.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>UCSC has shaped me a lot, I think, particularly in showing me an interesting group of people. Working as a reporter on a campus as politically active as UCSC was quite an experience, as there was never a shortage of interesting, passionate people working for causes they believed in.</p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>My future plans are still a bit murky. I'm going to be studying abroad in Santiago, Chile, until December, but after that I'm not too sure. I anticipate it being a bit hard to find a writing job in this economy, but if I can find one, that might be an option. I'm also very interested in law school and/or journalism school, based on where I get in and what I can afford.</p><p> </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>I chose College Nine because I was very intrigued by the core class, International and Global Perspectives. At the time I was still planning on majoring in politics, and the international and political aspects of the core class appealed to me. I really enjoyed that class, and it set me on a course to keep learning about the developing world. I did not end up majoring in politics, but it encouraged me to join the <a href="http://giip.org">Global Information Internship Program</a> (GIIP), and I was there for a couple years.</p><p> </p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>In my time at UC Santa Cruz, I tried to participate in as many groups as I could manage with my time available. I was a member of the College Nine Senate as a freshman, and I was the College Nine representative to Core Council. Later, I joined <i>City on a Hill Press</i> in spring quarter of my freshman year as a copy editor and page designer. That quarter, I co-wrote the feature "Toeing the Line" (with Alia Wilson), which won the Katharine M. MacDonald Award for Excellence in Student Journalism. After another quarter as a copy editor, I became a national news reporter, and then world/national desk editor for <i>CHP.</i> I was then managing editor for two quarters and was elected co-editor in chief (with Samantha Thompson) of <i>CHP,</i> a title I held for a year. During that time I was also a fellow for the Global Information Internship Program though I quit after I was elected co-editor-in-chief. I also participated in Alternative Spring Break in Mexico my sophomore year, and I did the UC Center in Sacramento (UCCS) political journalism course this past summer. While there I interned as the <i>Sacramento Bee'</i>s first-ever Capitol Bureau intern from UCCS, where I wrote about politics every day. I was also fortunate enough to interview the governor (along with two other, veteran reporters), as well as two gubernatorial candidates and several statewide representatives.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915aabe98072704601a012ff796ca184"><name>2882</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates Reunion Weekend; alumni gifts reach $745,000</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumni have contributed more than $745,000 to the school's annual Reunion Weekend fundraising drive, far exceeding the campus's goal.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>alumni, giving, fundraising, reunion, mcevoy, chronicle books, ucsc, campus, weekend, christopherson</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz alumni have contributed more than $745,000 to the school's annual Reunion Weekend fundraising drive, far exceeding the campus's goal.</description><start-date>1240642800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz celebrates...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2882</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2882</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338892701</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338892701</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/grads.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/grads.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grads.250.jpg</name><file-size>51423</file-size><width>250</width><height>203</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Alumni gave more than $750,000 to UCSC as part of Reunion Weekend, helping support the experiences of current students.

More than 1,000 people registered to attend <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2892">Reunion Weekend</a>, the school's annual alumni celebration, which took place April 24-26. This year's gathering included special festivities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the graduation of UCSC's pioneer class. </p><p>Signature gifts this year included $250,000 for the McHenry Library expansion from alumnus and CEO of <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/">Chronicle Books</a> Nion McEvoy (B.A. literature, Porter College, 1974), who is also a trustee of the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/ur/foundation/">UCSC Foundation</a>, noted Christopherson. Another $200,000 gift came from a donor who prefers to remain anonymous. A large number of alumni donors contribute to the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/index.html">UCSC Library</a> and the campus's 10 colleges, but they can direct their gifts to the area of their choice, she added.</p><p>The $745,000 total is the largest amount raised since 2005, when alumna Kit Mura-smith's record-setting $1.4 million gift boosted annual alumni giving to more than $1.7 million. <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/01-03/gift.asp">Mura-smith's gift</a> was the largest single donation ever given by an alum. Mura-smith, who earned a B.A. in applied social anthropology in 1975 from Merrill College, dedicated those funds to enhancing library facilities and providing scholarships for re-entry students.</p><p>So far, more than 800 donors have contributed to this fiscal year's fundraising drive, generating more than 1,025 gifts to UCSC, said Christopherson.</p><p>"In the most challenging economic crisis since the 1930s, it is extraordinary to see our alumni stepping up like this," said Christopherson. "It is more than double the $350,000 we had hoped to raise. Our alumni recognize the opportunity philanthropy provides to transform lives, and their generosity greatly increases the number of people whose lives will be touched."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915aad808072704601a012ffab76ed9b"><name>2883</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz veterans' programs get $100,000 funding boost</title><summary>UCSC's veterans' programs are among the best in the country, say funders. </summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>veterans, STARS, miller, military, ACE, Wal-Mart, tillman, American Council on Education</keywords><description>UCSC's veterans' programs are among the best in the country, say funders. </description><start-date>1240470000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz veterans'...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2883</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2883</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338893097</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338893097</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/karrasch.joshua.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/karrasch.joshua.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karrasch.joshua.300.jpg</name><file-size>189735</file-size><width>300</width><height>303</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A major grant will "expand and sustain" UCSC's programs for students who are military veterans. Photo by Dave Getzschman.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Veterans' programs offered by UC Santa Cruz are among the best in the country, according to the American Council on Education and the Wal-Mart Foundation, which today announced a $100,000 grant to support UCSC's programs.</p><p>The campus was one of 20 institutions across the country that will receive grants as part of the ACE/Wal-Mart $2 million Success for Veterans Award Grants program. Recipients were honored for operating "model programs advancing access and success in higher education for veterans and their families."</p><p>About 80 veterans are currently enrolled at UCSC, according to Corinne Miller, director of Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS), which administers veterans' programs. STARS offers a peer-mentor program for veterans and coordinates a network of services offered by different units on campus for veterans, including admissions, financial aid, housing, and academic advising.</p><p>"This grant will allow us to expand and sustain our programs," said Miller. "We're so excited." UCSC was selected out of a field of nearly 250 applications.  </p><p>Veterans on campus have served in all branches of the military, and UCSC is welcoming a growing number of veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, she added. </p><p>UCSC's peer-mentor program for veterans was established last year with support from the Capitola Book Café, recalled Miller. A focus group made up of student veterans had identified the need for such a program, "but we really didn't have the resources to move ahead," she explained. </p><p>"Then we got a phone call out of the blue from Janet Leimeister at the Book Café, who was offering to support a program for veterans," said Miller. Learning of Miller's aspirations, Leimeister organized a benefit reading at the Book Café with author Mary Tillman in June that jump-started UCSC's program. Tillman is the author of <i>Boots on the Ground by Dusk: My Tribute to Pat Tillman</i>, which honors her son, a former professional football player who was killed while serving as a U.S. Army Ranger in Afghanistan. </p><p>"We are so grateful for that support, and this ACE/Wal-Mart grant will help us continue and expand," said Miller, noting that UCSC is collaborating with Cabrillo College to create a "seamless safety net for our veterans who begin at Cabrillo and transfer to UCSC."</p><p>In addition to working with current students who are veterans, STARS serves family members of student veterans, collaborates with community agencies, and works with active service members who are preparing for college.</p><p>"Everything that makes UCSC an excellent undergraduate campus is especially true for returning veterans," said Miller. "We're a smaller, world-class institution that offers tremendous support. Students can work with faculty and participate in research here. UCSC is terrific for veterans coming back and making the transition to academia."</p><p>Over the past year, the Wal-Mart Foundation has awarded more than $3.6 million in grants to organizations in support of programs that provide educational assistance for veterans.</p><p>"We appreciate the service and sacrifice of our nation's military men and women and our veterans, and have historically worked to address some of the special unmet needs facing the military community," said Margaret McKenna, president of the Wal-Mart Foundation. "The Wal-Mart Foundation is proud to support the American Council on Education, its colleges and universities, and many other programs that help our veterans get the resources they need to succeed in their education and their transition back to civilian life."</p><p>Other grant recipients were: California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; California State University, Sacramento; Clackamas Community College (OR); Colorado State University; Empire State University, SUNY; Fairleigh Dickinson University (NJ); Fresno City College (CA); George Mason University (VA); Hunter College School of Social Work, CUNY; Lane Community College (OR); Los Angeles City College; Madison Area Technical College (WI); Onondaga Community College (NY); Park University (MO); Ramapo College (NJ); Southwestern College (CA); Trident Technical College (SC); University of Maine, Augusta; University of Maryland, University College.</p><p>"Higher education is in a unique position to serve the men and women who have so bravely served our nation," said ACE President Molly Corbett Broad. "The institutions receiving these grants currently enroll nearly 25,000 veterans. When the expanded GI Bill benefits become available in August, we anticipate that these numbers will increase by approximately 20 percent, giving these institutions the opportunity to serve nearly 30,000 veterans this fall. These grants will provide needed resources to expand and enhance the work already being done on these 20 campuses, and to support the dissemination of lessons learned to other institutions. We are so grateful to the Wal-Mart Foundation for their generous support of these worthwhile projects."</p><p> </p><p>ACE received nearly 250 applications for Success for Veterans Award Grants, which were reviewed by a selection committee of higher education leaders, program and policy directors, and veterans. Thirty semifinalists were selected and reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of retired college and university chancellors and presidents. Selection criteria included quality and sustainability of the existing programs and initiatives, as well as strategies for disseminating best practices to other institutions.</p><p>The ACE/Wal-Mart Success for Veterans Award Grants are part of ACE's Serving Those Who Serve initiative, a multi-year effort designed to effect major changes in how veterans learn about their education benefits and postsecondary options, and how institutional leaders can build capacity to serve veterans on their campuses. In addition, ACE's Serving Those Who Serve initiative includes a college planning web site and outreach campaign to inform veterans about accessing and utilizing their education benefits, and several research-based publications. ACE also hosted several regional meetings that allowed institutions to discuss concerns and pose questions about the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915aaf2f8072704601a012ffb55ee5b8"><name>2884</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Sandra Faber honored by Franklin Institute</title><summary>Astronomer Sandra Faber received the 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science in a ceremony yesterday in Philadelphia.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><description>Astronomer Sandra Faber received the 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science in a ceremony yesterday in Philadelphia.</description><start-date>1240556400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Sandra Faber honored...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2884</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2884</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338893540</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338893540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/composite.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/composite.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>composite.jpg</name><file-size>58635</file-size><width>300</width><height>459</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sandra Faber</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, received the 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science in a ceremony yesterday at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. </p><p>The Bower Award and Prize, which includes a gold medal and cash prize of $250,000, is among the nation's richest science prizes (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2739">earlier story</a>).

I value all the support my favorite film professors Amelie Hastie and Shelley Stamp have given me, both within the classroom and beyond it. The Film Department has done an amazing job of selecting approachable professors. Outside of the Film Department, my favorite professor is Michelle Erai, who taught several classes under the Feminist Studies Department. She believes in all of her students and encourages them to do things they never thought possible.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b> </p><p>I've been introduced to so many films that became instant favorites within the film department, each with special moments of discovery, but my favorite moment at UCSC was when Professor Erai told my Post-Colonial Studies class that her goal was to make us published authors by July. I thought this was preposterous and I decided that there was no way I could be one of those authors. She proved me wrong and set me on a track of using feminist critique to approach film and digital media, which also led to me declaring the film major so I could more fully apply this critical study.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b> </p><p>Stevenson Cafe is one of the places I visit the most because it is where I am most likely to run into the people I care about--plus their avocado and grilled cheese bagels are made by experts.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b>  </p><p>I wouldn't say that UCSC has shaped me, but I have felt more freedom to explore, examine, and change how I want to participate in this world, and I think this is one of the values encouraged by the student body of UCSC, as well as the courses.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b> </p><p>I plan on moving closer to my job at IMVU Inc. in Palo Alto, where I will be working full-time in the marketing department. I'm excited to no longer have my attention split between schoolwork and work! It's going to be great to get to read all the books I haven't had time for in the last four years and to live in a more permanent location, hopefully in Sunnyvale.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>Stevenson was my second choice, but I'm so happy that I ended up there. So many of my college friends are people I met freshman year in the Stevenson dorms and I'm honored to know such talented, supportive, and fun people. Many of my Stevenson friends share similar interests, and I've really enjoyed extending my learning experience beyond the classroom and continuing to have conversations back in the dorms.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Amanda Kessner, a Community Studies and Feminist Studies major, decided to organize a trip to work with the Common Grounds Collective and help Ninth Ward Louisiana residents after Hurricane Katrina; I helped fundraise. I spent my spring break with her and other UCSC students, and I'm so glad I went to help and got to hear how Katrina and the government response affected the Ninth Ward residents from people who actually experienced it, and I'm thankful for being given permission to tell their stories.</p><p>I got into the Critical Studies discipline in the Film and Digital Media Department and am working on a thesis on <i>Battlestar Galactica, Voyager, Buffy,</i> and <i>Dark Angel</i> and looking at Gayatri Spivak's definition of the subaltern, as well as Donna Haraway's Cyborg in relation to these television texts.</p><p>My paper "Continuing the colonial process through video games" has been published in the peer-reviewed journal <i>MAI Review.</i></p><p>I was on the Critical Studies Faculty Search Committee for the Film and Digital Media Department.</p><p>I'm coming up on my second year at IMVU Inc., where I've been promoted to marketing associate.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ab3aa8072704601a012ffadf1743e"><name>2886</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Welcomes Director of Internal Audit and Advisory Services</title><start-date>1240470000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Welcomes Director of...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2886</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2886</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338894713</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338894713</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is our pleasure to announce that Mr. Barry Long will be joining the campus as Director of Internal Audit and Advisory Services. Barry replaces Geri Gail, who  is retiring from UCSC after 30 years of dedicated university service.</p><p>Barry comes to UCSC as a Certified Public Accountant, and with a long and successful career in the field of Auditing. For the past 20 years, he worked in the Audit department at the University of California (UC) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, most recently serving as the Internal Audit Manager. His knowledge and familiarity with the policies and processes at UC and higher education in general add to the depth and breadth of his skills and qualifications. Barry's past audit experience includes work in the medical and health arena, including work for the County of Santa Clara, and the State of California, Department of Health Services. In addition to his professional achievements, he is actively involved with the Institute of Internal Auditors, an international professional association of more than 120,000 members providing dynamic leadership for the global profession of internal auditing.</p><p>We thank Assistant Campus Provost Charlotte Moreno and the Internal Audit Director search committee for their dedication and efforts in this search. In addition, we extend thanks to David V. Lane for filling in as Interim Audit Director during the search, and for his leadership in enabling a smooth transition.</p><p>The Internal Audit Director in education plays a key role in assisting senior management in carrying out its fiduciary responsibilities, enhancing its reputation, and maintaining public trust. Barry comes highly recommended and respected amongst his peers and supervisors, and we are all delighted to welcome him on board as he prepares to join UCSC on June 1st, 2009.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Patrick Reed, University Auditor, University of California, Office of the President and Tom Vani, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ab5c08072704601a012ff257ebb03"><name>2887</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Budget update from Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</title><summary>Campus Provost David Kliger provides an update on campus budget planning for 2009-10, including the next steps at the state level to address California's economic issues </summary><description>Campus Provost David Kliger provides an update on campus budget planning for 2009-10, including the next steps at the state level to address California's economic issues </description><start-date>1240470000000</start-date><display-name>Budget update from Campus...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2887</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2887</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338895241</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338895241</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Last month I reported that UCSC faces $17.5 million in permanent budget reductions over a two-year period - $4.5 million in reductions this fiscal year and another $13 million anticipated next year (fiscal 2009-10). These are in addition to $6.5 million in one-time cuts already incurred this year.  I am writing to update you on what has happened since my last communication.</p><p><b>Magnitude of cuts impacting all areas of campus:</b>  To put this in context, we have incurred a 9.5 percent reduction in the state-funded portion of our budget (excluding the educational fee and non-resident tuition). This reduction is of such a magnitude that no area of campus can be spared from permanent budget reductions.</p><p>To date, academic divisions have been asked to absorb slightly less than one-third ($5.5 million) of the $17.5 million total of permanent cuts, with the major burden assigned to administrative divisions ($11.4 million), and the rest taken from central funds.  Deans and Vice Chancellors have been informed of the reduction assigned to their units. They are now determining what actions will be needed to reduce expenditures. For matters relating to academic programs, there will be full consultation with the Academic Senate as appropriate. </p><p>I have also asked deans and vice chancellors to keep people within their divisions fully informed about their respective budget-reduction plans.</p><p><b>Conditions may worsen; May election key:</b>  On May 19, California voters will consider several budget-related ballot measures.  The outcome of this election will have a significant impact on the state budget that was approved in February.  Further information on the propositions can be found on the Secretary of State's <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov"> Web site</a>. I urge you to become informed, and vote.</p><p>Meanwhile, California's economic conditions remain uncertain.  The state's legislative analyst has estimated that revenues next year could fall $8 billion short of targets contained in the budget stabilization measure approved by the legislature and governor in February.  Although it is too soon to predict exactly what this means for the University, I believe we must be prepared for the possibility of substantial further reductions in state support.</p><p><b>New information resource available:</b>  The budgetary landscape will continue to evolve over the next several months.  The uncertainty is troubling and I understand that regular and transparent communications about our budget is important to you. Toward that end, a <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/budget_update/">budget web site</a> has been created to provide you the latest news on the budget. There you will find detail on the distribution of the current cuts by division, and an updated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) summary. I hope you'll bookmark and visit this site regularly.</p><p><b>Reality setting in:</b>  Although we all knew cuts of this magnitude would be difficult, we are now beginning to encounter some of the realities of these tough decisions. Some valued colleagues are losing their jobs. Service levels in some areas are sure to decline. I share, with you, anxiety and worry surrounding the future of various programs and the people who serve and support them. I assure you that all programmatic decisions are being and will continue to be made carefully and deliberately. </p><p>I am grateful for the daily efforts you continue to make on behalf of this campus-and for your patience and perseverance as we meet the extraordinary challenges before us.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Campus Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ab7468072704601a012ffd201925b"><name>2888</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>A &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12195137"&gt;front page story&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; focused on astronomer Steve Vogt and the new telescope being installed at Lick Observatory.</summary><description>A &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12195137"&gt;front page story&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; focused on astronomer Steve Vogt and the new telescope being installed at Lick Observatory.</description><start-date>1240815600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2888</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2888</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338895633</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338895633</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12195137">front page story</a> in the <em><strong>San Jose Mercury News</strong></em> focused on astronomer Steve Vogt and the new Automated Planet Finder telescope being installed at Lick Observatory.

(All Photos: Terry Way)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a fact-filled, fast-paced lecture in front of a near-capacity crowd Friday night at Santa Cruz's Cocoanut Grove, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke passionately about the political and economic forces that have made our country dependent on oil and coal. But he also told the 600 people who attended UC Santa Cruz's second annual <a href="http://intellectualforum.ucsc.edu">Intellectual Forum</a> that the election of Barack Obama has created an opportunity to steer U.S. energy policy in a more sustainable direction.</p>
<p>"We have a government today that's determined to do this," said Kennedy to enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.robertfkennedyjr.com/">Kennedy</a>, the author of <em>Crimes Against Nature,</em> serves as chief prosecuting attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper and president of the Waterkeeper Alliance. He is also a clinical professor and supervising attorney at Pace University School of Law's Environmental Litigation Clinic. His appearance ushered in UC Santa Cruz's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2892">2009 Reunion Weekend</a>.</p>
<p>The third child of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy was introduced on Friday by <a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/people.html">Vinod Khosla</a>, a leading green venture capitalist and a cofounder of Sun Microsystems. In brief remarks before Kennedy's "Our Environmental Legacy" address, Khosla called himself a "technology optimist." The words could describe the featured speaker as well.</p>
<p>In fact, Kennedy said the U.S. could theoretically satisfy a large part of its energy appetite by employing existing solar technologies in a single 85 mile-by-85 mile area in the sun-rich southwestern states. "We could harness solar in that area to meet 100 percent of our electricity needs," Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Doing so would not only lessen our dependence on foreign oil and domestic coal, he added, it would address the escalating climate change threat. The "carbon cronies" have spent hundreds of millions of dollars convincing Americans that global warming doesn't exist, Kennedy said. Their twin argument against sustainable energy: moving too quickly to bring solar, wind, and other energy sources online would cause "grave dislocations in our economy," Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Recent history doesn't support such views, he added, citing Iceland, Sweden, Brazil, and Costa Rica as countries where movements toward sustainability created business opportunity and economic growth.</p>
<p>Still, Obama's election doesn't remove all impediments to implementing a sustainable energy policy, Kennedy said, adding that eliminating the "built-in advantage of oil subsidies" remains one of the movement's highest hurdles. Without such subsidies, gasoline would sell for $12 a gallon in this country, which would obviously level the playing field for sustainable alternatives. Kennedy said a second significant impediment to full-scale sustainability is the inadequacy of this country's electricity grid; he added, however, that the Obama administration understands that a national investment in a grid upgrade will be necessary to realize the full potential of alternatives like solar and wind.</p>
<p>Following a nearly 90-minute talk, delivered with no notes, Kennedy remained in the ballroom for nearly 30 additional minutes, speaking with individuals, posing for photos, and even signing a few autographs.</p>
<p>A panel discussion on campus on Saturday morning was designed to foster continued discussion of the themes raised by Kennedy on Friday night. At the Intellectual Forum discussion, held in the Humanities Lecture Hall, three panelists discussed the Kennedy talk, as well as their own relationship to the environmental movement.</p>
<p>Featured panelists were UCSC faculty member Daniel Press, chair of <a href="http://envs.ucsc.edu/">Environmental Studies</a> at UCSC; Claire Strader, the manager of the <a href="http://www.troygardens.org/">Troy Community Farm</a> in Madison, Wisconsin (and a graduate of UCSC's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture program); and Richard Harris, science correspondent for <a href="http://www.npr.org">National Public Radio</a> (and a UCSC graduate in biology).</p>
<p><a href="http://envs.ucsc.edu/directory/details.php?id=12">Press</a> described UCSC's offerings in environmental studies, adding that faculty in the program are impressed by their students' desire to make an environmental difference. "We try to take that energy and make it more rigorous and analytical," Press said.</p>
<p>Strader, who was the top vote-getter during an online poll that was part of a grassroots movement to establish a <a href="http://whitehousefarmer.com/">White House Farmer</a>, encouraged the people in attendance to make their food choices from a holistic perspective. Buying organic food from local growers does more than provide you with healthy vegetables and support your neighbors, she said; doing so also saves energy (fuel needed to transport food around the country) and "sets an example for people around you."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100631">Harris</a> acknowledged the challenges in reporting on the environment; "when you're covering Capitol Hill and you have congressman calling global warming a fraud, you have to report that." He also drew a distinction between environmental advocacy and environmental reporting; "my job, to the extent that I can, is to synthesize [information], not to give equal weight."</p>
<p>Sponsors of the 2009 Intellectual Forum included Comcast, ZENN Motor Company, and UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures.</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s Intellectual Forum address</a>. The audience clung to his words on our "environmental destiny" as he spoke for 90 minutes, only stopping during moments of applause to sip his water.</p><p>On Saturday, the weather was as good as the mood at UCSC as hundreds of alumni enjoyed events across campus. The day began with the Intellectual Forum Panel Discussion to discuss Kennedy's keynote on Friday night. Joan Fitting Scott, president of the Alumni Association, moderated the conversation between the panelists: NPR correspondent Richard Harris, "White House Farmer" Claire Strader, and Professor and Chair of Environmental Studies Daniel Press.</p><p>The panel was followed by the presentation of the Distinguished Teaching Award given to Alan Richards, professor of environmental studies, and the Outstanding Staff Award, presented to Rosie Cabrera, director of the Chicano Latino Resource Center. (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2788">advance story</a>.)</p><p>At the forum's conclusion, guests paraded to the Stevenson Courtyard for a casual picnic lunch, where they enjoyed a delicious spread of locally grown food as well as wine and beer from alumni vintners and brew masters. </p><p>Sammy the Slug made a guest appearance at the lunch and <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2882">presented Chancellor George Blumenthal with an oversized, ceremonial check for $744,457</a>, representing donations made to campus so far this year by graduates celebrating their 5- through 40-year reunions; the total is more than double last year's "reunion class" giving. The men's soccer team entered the courtyard with enthusiasm, cheering with the alumni chanting, "Go Slugs! Go Slugs!" The team escorted Chancellor Blumenthal down to the soccer field for a game against alumni.   </p><p>The reunion weekend theme of "Our Environmental Destiny" resonated throughout the weekend. Five Zenn cars zipped throughout campus, shuttling alumni from events and showcasing their zero-emission, no-noise feature. The new EcoAlum debuted at Reunion Weekend, organizing 80 alumni throughout the weekend to join this network of environmental alumni.</p><p>As the evening rolled on, the Pioneer Class celebrated its 40th Reunion with the pioneer tradition of a steak and ice cream Sunday celebratory dinner. The graduates of the last 10 years partied the night away at the Young Alumni Party at Cypress Lounge in downtown Santa Cruz. </p><p>"We are grateful to the entire campus community for opening its arms to alumni, offering almost 40 different Reunion Weekend receptions, reunions, and showcase events," said Alumni Association Executive Director Carolyn Christopherson. "Faculty, staff, students, and others with whom they interact create an enduring connection between graduates and the campus, facilitating ever-greater levels of support."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ac48a8072704601a012ff8177452d"><name>2894</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Christopher Gauk-Roger</title><summary>B.A., Film and Digital Media</summary><description>B.A., Film and Digital Media</description><start-date>1240815600000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2894</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2894</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338899024</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338899024</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/gauk_roger.christopher.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/gauk_roger.christopher.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gauk_roger.christopher.300.jpg</name><file-size>60602</file-size><width>300</width><height>406</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Christopher Gauk-Roger (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Christopher Gauk-Roger</p><p><b>Age:</b> 22</p><p><b>Major:</b> Film and Digital Media</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Los Angeles</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Oakes</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why? </b></p><p>My favorite course was <i>Broadcast Journalism,</i> which is offered through Community Studies and KZSC. I took the class during my first year and it helped shape my college plans. I came to UCSC wanting to do broadcast journalism, but wasn't sure how I could make that happen. This class served as my segue into KZSC and, more specifically, KZSC News. It helped to put my interests into action and taught me that UCSC has millions of opportunities that one just has to search for. I am now instructing the course, and hope to assure students each quarter that they, too, can find an outlet for their passions on this campus.</p><p> </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>My most memorable experiences at UCSC are always the final Gospel Choir concerts I partake in every winter and spring quarter. Gospel Choir has served as an inspiring and necessary experience while I've been at UCSC. Each concert is a different experience, but I am always amazed by the amount of people who attend and how involved they get with the songs we perform.</p><p>That, and being on the air at KZSC for the first time. There's no greater rush than getting through your first live news broadcast. </p><p></p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>The KZSC station, because of the opportunities it has provided me and due to the amazing people I am always meeting there. It's a wonderful place to spend time on campus, and I encourage everyone to stop by to find out more about the station. When I need to be alone, though, the Oakes Lawn is incredible. It's the perfect place to lay out and get homework done without interruption. It also happens to host one of the most picturesque views on this campus.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>UCSC has been instrumental in helping me discover both where I want to go after college and what I want to do. I wouldn't say my time at UCSC has changed me, but it certainly has helped me grow. I was an introverted and passive individual when I first arrived here four years ago, confused about what to study or what to do with my life. I have since become someone who is unafraid to get what he wants and make every moment count.</p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>I am currently applying for summer internships within various news media outlets. I'm certain that something will come of that, but if not, I will be applying again in the fall. I will be giving the real world a chance for four to five months and, if nothing pans out, I will be applying for graduate school in the fall to work toward a master's in broadcast journalism. Graduate school was my initial plan, but I have come to realize that the amount of experience I gained working at KZSC may make further schooling unnecessary for my intended career path.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>Oakes wasn't my initial choice, but I did add it to my list because it features one of the most open-ended themes. Despite my doubts, Oakes proved to be the ideal college. It houses great people, an amazing staff, and a fantastic core course. I was so impressed by Oakes that I took the neighborhood assistant position for my second year. It was my goal then, and still is, to assist others in realizing just how incredible Oakes is. It became home for me, and I wouldn't have changed my experience there for anything.  </p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>I've done a lot with my time at UCSC, but nothing stands out more than my accomplishments at KZSC. I was able to learn how to create news stories, as well as how to run an entire news broadcast. I've now learned how to instruct a course, including developing a syllabus and reader, promotion, creating two lectures a week, and inspiring students to become as interested in journalism as I am. More than that, though, I think my greatest accomplishment derives from the fact that I made my time at UCSC as worthwhile as possible. I didn't let the fact that the school did not offer my ideal major slow me down. Instead, I sought out ways to make my experience work for my interests. I hope this inspires others to do the same; it may take a lot of work, but you can reach any of your goals while at UCSC. Through my position as a campus tour guide, I have not only developed my public speaking skills, but I have also been able to assure numerous students that college is a realistic dream and that Santa Cruz may just be the perfect spot for them. Working at Oakes, I was able to make new students' transition to college as easy as it was for me, and served as a peer for those who needed it.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ac64c8072704601a012ffe0110360"><name>2895</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's Annual Spring Plant Sale features "victory garden" crops</title><summary>The Farm &amp; Garden's annual Spring Plant Sale features food crops for home gardens.</summary><author>Martha Brown (831) 459-3376; mtbrown@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>farm, garden, plant, sale, organic, victory garden, annuals, perennials</keywords><description>The Farm &amp; Garden's annual Spring Plant Sale features food crops for home gardens.</description><start-date>1240815600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2895</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2895</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338899484</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338899484</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-3376</phone><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/tomatoes.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/tomatoes.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tomatoes.300.jpg</name><file-size>53957</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Heirloom tomatoes sell out early during the Farm &amp; Garden's Spring Plant Sale.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With backyard food production on the rise, organizers of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's Spring Plant Sale have focused on food crops for home "victory gardens" along with an outstanding array of perennials for the garden and landscape.</p>

Ramirez, who has held management positions at Bell Labs and Los Alamos National Laboratory, joins the school at the beginning of its second decade.</p>
<p>Ramirez is currently leader of composite materials and device development for LGS, a subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent. He joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in 1984 and spent much of his career at Bell Labs, now a unit of Alcatel-Lucent. In 2000, he went to Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he led the materials integration science laboratory and the condensed matter and thermal physics group, before returning to Bell Labs in 2003. At Bell he served most recently as director of the device physics research department. Ramirez is also an adjunct professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Established in 1997, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering is UCSC's first professional school and has developed to meet the technology demands of the 21st century. Its growing presence in Silicon Valley includes collaborations with industry partners to create new opportunities in research and education.</p>
<p>"With his knowledge, experience, and vision, Art Ramirez will be a great leader for our innovative Baskin School of Engineering," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. "During its first 11 years, the Baskin School has recruited a dynamic faculty, focusing on 21st-century technologies and partnerships with universities and companies in Silicon Valley. Art's experience and commitment to excellence will help our faculty, students, and staff build on the early successes of our engineering school."</p>
<p>Ramirez will take the helm at the Baskin School of Engineering on May 1, 2009. He succeeds Michael Isaacson, Narinder Singh Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics, who has served as acting dean of the school since 2007.</p>
<p>Ramirez said he relishes the opportunity to lead an engineering school that emphasizes innovation in an interdisciplinary setting.</p>
<p>"Technology is becoming multidisciplinary. Engineers need an expansive mindset," Ramirez said. "When we expose students at every level to technology-driven research, they become comfortable with unsolved problems and gain the confidence to explore them. Faculty define the areas of research and, through teaching, set the standards for excellence. At the Baskin School of Engineering, there exist the very best examples of research and its dissemination."</p>
<p>Ramirez's research interests include frustrated systems, multiferroic magnetic materials, and organic semiconductors. He also has led projects that moved successfully from research into the product development phase, such as a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based magnetometer developed at Bell Labs for applications such as low-cost perimeter security and navigation.</p>
<p>Ongoing research projects led by Ramirez include the study of fundamental charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors. Potential applications of this work include the development of efficient, lightweight, and inexpensive photovoltaic cells.</p>
<p>In earlier research, Ramirez performed the first bulk measurements of superconductivity in both cuprates and carbon-60 "buckyballs," pioneered effects of geometrical frustration in magnets such as the "spin ice" state, and led research in "colossal magnetoresistance," among other accomplishments. He is the author of more than 200 technical publications.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), Ramirez earned B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics at Yale University. He has served on numerous advisory panels and committees, including the APS Council, the executive committee of the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics, and the Solid State Sciences Committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p><strong>What is swine flu?</strong></p>
<p>Swine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that causes regular outbreaks in pigs. People do not normally get swine flu, but human infections can and do happen. Swine flu viruses have been reported to spread from person-to-person, but in the past, this transmission was limited and not sustained beyond three people.</p>
<p><strong>Are there human infections with swine flu in the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>In late March and early April 2009, cases of human infection with swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses were first reported in Southern California and near San Antonio, Texas. Other U.S. states have reported cases of swine flu infection in humans and cases have been reported internationally as well. An updated case count of confirmed swine flu infections in the United States is kept at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htm">www.cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htm</a>. CDC and local and state health agencies are working together to investigate this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Is this swine flu virus contagious?</strong></p>
<p>CDC has determined that this swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is contagious and is spreading from human to human. However, at this time, it not known how easily the virus spreads between people.</p>
<p><strong>What are the signs and symptoms of swine flu in people?</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people have reported diarrhea and vomiting associated with swine flu. In the past, severe illness (pneumonia and respiratory failure) and deaths have been reported with swine flu infection in people. Like seasonal flu, swine flu may cause a worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>How does swine flu spread?</strong></p>
<p>Spread of this swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is thought to be happening in the same way that seasonal flu spreads. Flu viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing of people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.</p>
<p><strong>How can someone with the flu infect someone else?</strong></p>
<p>Infected people may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 7 or more days after becoming sick. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do to keep from getting the flu?</strong></p>

<p>First and most important: wash your hands. Try to stay in good general health. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. Try not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with the flu virus. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>
<p><strong>Are there medicines to treat swine flu?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. CDC recommends the use of oseltamivir or zanamivir for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with these swine influenza viruses. Antiviral drugs are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaler) that fight against the flu by keeping flu viruses from reproducing in your body. If you get sick, antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within 2 days of symptoms).</p>
<p><strong>How long can an infected person spread swine flu to others?</strong></p>
<p>People with swine influenza virus infection should be considered potentially contagious as long as they are symptomatic and possible for up to 7 days following illness onset. Children, especially younger children, might potentially be contagious for longer periods.</p>
<p><strong>What surfaces are most likely to be sources of contamination?</strong></p>
<p>Germs can be spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person move through the air. Germs can be spread when a person touches respiratory droplets from another person on a surface like a desk and then touches their own eyes, mouth or nose before washing their hands.</p>
<p><strong>How long can viruses live outside the body?</strong></p>
<p>We know that some viruses and bacteria can live 2 hours or longer on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and desks. Frequent handwashing will help you reduce the chance of getting contamination from these common surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do to protect myself from getting sick?</strong></p>
<p>There is no vaccine available right now to protect against swine flu. There are everyday actions that can help prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses like influenza. Take these everyday steps to protect your health:</p>
<p>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Try to avoid close contact with sick people. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>If you get sick with influenza, CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>What is the best way to keep from spreading the virus through coughing or sneezing?</strong></p>
<p>If you are sick, limit your contact with other people as much as possible. Do not go to work or school if ill. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Put your used tissue in the waste basket. Cover your cough or sneeze if you do not have a tissue. Then, clean your hands, and do so every time you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best technique for washing my hands to avoid getting the flu?</strong></p>
<p>Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. Wash with soap and water. or clean with alcohol-based hand cleaner. we recommend that when you wash your hands -- with soap and warm water -- that you wash for 15 to 20 seconds. When soap and water are not available, alcohol-based disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers may be used. You can find them in most supermarkets and drugstores. If using gel, rub your hands until the gel is dry. The gel doesn't need water to work; the alcohol in it kills the germs on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do if I get sick?</strong></p>
<p>If you live in areas where swine influenza cases have been identified and become ill with influenza-like symptoms, including fever, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, or vomiting or diarrhea, you may want to contact their health care provider, particularly if you are worried about your symptoms. Your health care provider will determine whether influenza testing or treatment is needed.</p>
<p>If you are sick, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people as much as possible to keep from spreading your illness to others.</p>
<p>If you become ill and experience any of the following warning signs, seek emergency medical care.</p>
<p>In adults, emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Sudden dizziness <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Confusion <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Severe or persistent vomiting</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>How serious is swine flu infection?</strong></p>
<p>Like seasonal flu, swine flu in humans can vary in severity from mild to severe. Between 2005 until January 2009, 12 human cases of swine flu were detected in the U.S. with no deaths occurring. However, swine flu infection can be serious. In September 1988, a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman in Wisconsin was hospitalized for pneumonia after being infected with swine flu and died 8 days later. A swine flu outbreak in Fort Dix, New Jersey occurred in 1976 that caused more than 200 cases with serious illness in several people and one death.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get swine influenza from eating or preparing pork?</strong></p>
<p>No. Swine influenza viruses are not spread by food. You cannot get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Eating properly handled and cooked pork products is safe.</p>

I'm writing to update you on our efforts to monitor this situation and offer tips to those of you who may be concerned about this potentially serious infection becoming more widespread</p><p>in our community.</p><p>The public health experts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are closely monitoring the situation. As of this afternoon, there have been no confirmed cases in northern California. In the event of more widespread community outbreak in Santa Cruz County, UCSC leaders are prepared to work closely with local Public Health authorities to institute measures for reducing the spread of a serious infection.</p><p>In the meantime, the best thing you can do is be aware of recommended preventive measures for the swine flu, which are similar to those for other respiratory viruses. These include:</p><p>* Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.</p><p>* Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hands cleaners are also effective.</p><p>* Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread that way.</p><p>* Influenza is thought to spread mainly person-to-person through coughing or sneezing of infected people. Try to avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p><p>* If you get sick, CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them.</p><p>If you develop flu-like symptoms (that include abrupt onset of fever with temperature greater than 100, chills, severe cough, shortness of breath, severe muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat or vomiting) consult your doctor if you have traveled to a region with confirmed swine flu. UCSC students who have recently returned from travel to regions with confirmed swine flu and are currently experiencing flu-like symptoms should call or come into the Student Health Center for evaluation.</p><p>A UCSC web site (http://www.ucsc.edu/swineflu/) has been established with current information, including links to other campus information and various government sources. It will be regularly updated. Campus officials are continuously monitoring this outbreak to ensure that we are prepared to take additional steps if warranted.</p><p><b>See the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2898">Centers for Disease Control FAQ on swine flu</a>.</b></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Drew Malloy, MD, Medical Director of UCSC Student Health Center</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ad1ad8072704601a012fff574b707"><name>2901</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of new dean of the Baskin School of Engineering</title><start-date>1240902000000</start-date><display-name>Appointment of new dean...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2901</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2901</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338902387</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338902387</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are very pleased to announce that the UC Regents have approved the appointment of Arthur P.

Houston-who taught writing part-time at UCSC as a lecturer for more than two decades-died on April 16 at his home in Santa Cruz. He was 75.</p><p> </p><p>The acclaimed author of eight novels, including <i>Snow Mountain Passage</i> and <i>Continental Drift</i>, Houston also wrote nonfiction works that include <i>Californians; In the Ring of Fire: A Pacific Basin Journey</i>; and <i>Farewell to Manzanar</i>, which he coauthored with his wife, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston. </p><p>The latter-a true account of her family's experience during and after the World War II internment-is now in its 67th printing and has become a standard work in schools and colleges across the country.</p><p>Steve Woodhams (Porter College 1974-77) offers the following remembrance of Houston: </p><p>"I took two classes with Jim Houston in the seventies at Crown College. They were classes taught from the point of view of a working writer, who had the authority but didn't have to be the authority, which may be why they made such an impression. </p><p>The first day Jim announced that only a handful of people made a living from writing and then talked about what it was like to work as a writer, income or not: especially that moment when an idea for a novel came to him. He described it as a flash of satori that would then take years to fulfill. </p><p>He said you couldn't write from flash cards full of big ideas about humanity. He'd tried that, he said, shaking his head. He talked about his work in the same forthright way he discussed ours, appreciating the essence or the scene that sparked, especially one scene set in an apple orchard that someone presented in the workshop. </p><p>I don't remember the harsher aspect of critiques or personalities spiraling out of control. That was not in his affable judicious ethos. Some afternoons we sat outside under the oak trees, talking in an easy-going circle. He often ended a discussion with a good-humored, "Well, back to the drawing board" taking the sting out of a less than favorable class response. Because when he said that it was as if he were talking about his own writing. It was assumed-that a writer always went back to the drawing board. </p><p>He brought guests to class, Al Young and Peter Beagle, introducing us to this society of authors, happy to share the floor and camaraderie. Then he was working on a novel about "Holy City" the ghost town, off the summit, and his exploration of history and the near-at-hand locales brought a dimension to the class, a richness to what writing could be. </p><p>Over the years I was to learn much more about his interest in the west, in Hawaii and about his own fascinating background but then I just saw glimmers as I did of my own life ahead-I didn't realize who he really was. But when decades later I saw a tall man walking with a friend late at night in North Beach, I recognized him at once. I fell in with them for several blocks, and when I said I'd been his student-it had been over twenty years--he graciously said, 'Yes, I thought that was you.'</p><p>After UCSC, I didn't see much of him in person but you couldn't help but be aware of his presence, his respectful witness of all things writing, western, and pacific. From what I recall today I know he was the best kind of teacher-the kind who gave you yourself."</p><p><i>Steve Woodhams (Porter College 1974-77), now teaches English at Chabot College in the East Bay.</i></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ad4de8072704601a012ff18d37279"><name>2903</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC among EPA's 'green power' winners; faculty member questions basis for ranking </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz and Santa Clara University have together purchased more than 68 million kilowatts of green power, earning accolades from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.??</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><description>UC Santa Cruz and Santa Clara University have together purchased more than 68 million kilowatts of green power, earning accolades from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.??</description><start-date>1240902000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC among EPA's 'green...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2903</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2903</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338903159</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338903159</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz and Santa Clara University have together purchased more than 68 million kilowatts of green power, earning accolades from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

The two universities won the EPA's Green Power College and University Challenge awards.<br/>
<br/>
<p>In addition, Intel Corp. has been honored as a Top 50 Purchaser by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Partnership program by purchasing more than 1 billion kilowatt-hours of green power annually--enough green power to meet 47 percent of the organization's purchased electricity use. (See <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/73DDBE9F0597F217852575A50072468A">EPA press release</a>.)</p>
<p>"Congratulations to the Intel Corp., University of Santa Clara, and UC Santa Cruz--their cutting-edge policies fortify our nation's commitment to cleaner, healthier air," said Deborah Jordan, the EPA's Air Division director for the Pacific Southwest. "With their commitment to use renewable energy, they are setting the standard for others and helping make renewable energy more affordable for all."</p>
<p>UCSC beat its rivals by purchasing 57 million kilowatt-hours of green power, representing 100 percent of the school's annual electricity usage. This is equivalent to the amount of electricity needed to power nearly 6,000 average American homes each year, or has the equivalent impact of reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of more than 7,000 passenger cars annually.</p>
<p>The EPA's Green Power Partnership works with more than 1,000 partner organizations to voluntarily purchase green power to reduce the environmental impacts of conventional electricity use.</p>
<p>Green power is generated from renewable resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, biogas, and low-impact hydropower. Green power electricity generates less pollution than conventional power and produces no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

(Photos by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dressed in a smart gray business suit and pearls, senior Amanda Wentz said she was looking for a job in marketing at Tuesday's All Majors Job &amp; Internship Fair, held in the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room.</p>
<p>The fact the military was at the event seemed fair to her, though she herself didn't plan on approaching the tables set up by the U.S Army or the U.S. Marine Corps Officer Programs.</p>
<p>"It's nice to have a wide array of options, and that includes the military," Wentz, 21, said. "I wouldn't want to stop anyone from going there."</p>
<p>Days after UCSC received a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2883">$100,000 grant</a> in support of its veterans' programs, the annual job fair--which includes military recruiters and has, in the past, been the site of vigorous anti-military and anti-war protests--proceeded peacefully and without demonstration.</p>
<p>The College Nine/Ten Co-curricular Programs Office maintained a booth outside the fair where students Alex Fischl and Lyric Kelkar quietly made buttons proclaiming slogans such as, "Peace is Patriotic" and "We need a Department of Peace."</p>
<p>"I think they have every right to be here," said Kelkar, referring to military recruiters. "But I don't agree with their policies, necessarily."</p>
<p>The lack of spirited protest could be attributable to the election of President Obama, said Felicia McGinty, vice chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>
<p>"I think it's because of the new administration and the different emphasis on ending the war," McGinty said. "This time last year, we didn't know who was going to be president."</p>
<p>Things went well at the Army and Marines tables, said recruiters.</p>
<p>"It's always refreshing just to be here and not have to interact with protestors," said Capt. Brian Lionbarger, officer selection officer for the United States Marine Corps. "It's more focused on the students."</p>
<p>"We're glad to be here," said Staff Sergeant Alan Beckwith of the United States Army. "A lot of students tell me they're looking for something that looks good on a resume and offers leadership experience."</p>
<p>Beckwith said he's seen more interest than usual from students over the past few months. That increase, he said, may stem from the new GI Bill signed into law last year, which will cover the full cost of education at any public school in the country and many private schools.</p>
<p>In a telling indicator of the state of the economy, the number of employers at this year's fair was less than half of last year's, according to McGinty. Eighty employers were at the fair last year; this year, there were 37.</p>
<p>The number of students attending dropped, too, from 750 last year to 487 this year, according to Acting Career Center Director Barbara Silverthorne. She said the drop likely corresponded to the decrease in employers, but added, "We're happy to help students look in other ways by having them come into our office and talk with advisers."</p>
<p>Overall, she said, the employers at the fair "were pleased with the quality of students they were seeing, and that's good for everyone."</p>
<p>At the table for the Lash Group, a reimbursement services firm in San Bruno, Christy Shoung said she was impressed with the students she was seeing.</p>
<p>"I've had a number of students who've researched the company," she said. "That means they're prepared."</p>
<p>Prepared or not, finding a job in the today's struggling economy will be a challenge, something that was not lost on the students attending the fair. But they held onto their sense of optimism.</p>
<p>"I feel unlucky," said Crystal Zhang, 24, who is earning a master's degree in economics and finance. "Before, there were jobs just for our skill set. Now we have to find other things we can also do. We'll just have to try harder."</p>

I took five classes with him, and he is also my advisor and guru helping me along as I write my senior thesis. He is also the director for the Center of World History at UCSC, a program that he created. Terry is my favorite professor because when I took my first class with him, during my sophomore year, I was terrified of him. He has an extremely professorial look--always in a collared shirt under a sweater or something similar, and he seemed very serious about teaching. But as the years went on and I took more and more classes with him, and began speaking with him before and after class, he became sort of a personal mentor. His brain is full of countless historical facts and ideas, and he has been an integral part in my survival senior year trying to work my way through my thesis. I know that years after I graduate I will still visit and talk to Terry, as he has become a solid rock in my intellectual life.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>I think that as a whole my first quarter as a freshman at UCSC was my most memorable experience. The group identity of myself and all my hallmates sharing a new and exciting experience together brought us close and allowed us to make friends quickly, party together, study together, and support each other when classes got difficult and we missed home. I think we all grew up a lot that quarter, and we did it together.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>There's a bench on a hill between East Field House and the East Remote Parking Lot that overlooks the whole city of Santa Cruz below and the beach beyond--it's the most incredible view on campus. Sitting out there and enjoying the outdoors is wonderful. </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>I have grown up more in four years than I think I had in the previous 18 years of my life. Learning to live with roommates, taking care of myself, balancing schoolwork and a social life, and the final stretch of graduation have shaped my life. I met friends that I am excited to graduate together with and see how we all move forward with our lives, and a boyfriend who I am excited to live and grow with. There have been good times and bad times, but they were all worth it.</p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>As for a job immediately after graduation, I have no idea. My dream has always been to become a writer, and I would like to eventually start a charity organization for literacy in third world countries. I am also looking forward to being more deeply involved in the Armenian National Committee of America and efforts toward the recognition of the Armenian genocide.</p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>I am writing my thesis as a social biography of my mother's side of the family. They have endured extremely rough, tumultuous times throughout their lives, beginning in Syria where in 1961 my grandfather was imprisoned and tortured as a suspected Communist. When he was released, the family moved to Lebanon, where they started life anew and lived happily until the civil war, when they all had to emigrate to the United States for safety. The thesis is examining the ways in which the course of history often determines the path of one's life more than any efforts on the part of the individual can.</p><p>I am also the first person in my family to attend and graduate college, which is an extremely proud moment for my loved ones.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ad9dd8072704601a012ff0527b33d"><name>2906</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>City water restrictions: Please do your part to conserve water</title><start-date>1240988400000</start-date><display-name>City water restrictions: Please...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2906</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2906</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338904466</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338904466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz City Council voted yesterday to institute restrictions on water use beginning May 1. The City Council declared a "Stage 2-Water Shortage Warning," with the goal of reducing water use in its service area by 15 percent. The restrictions, following three consecutive years with less-than-normal rainfall, continue through October.</p><p>I'm pleased to report that through the collective efforts of faculty, staff, and students, we have developed a comprehensive water-conservation plan. These efforts, part of our overall commitment to sustainability, are described on a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/conserving_water/">special water-conservation web site</a>, which I hope you'll take time to visit. It provides detail on the new city-mandated water use restrictions and helpful water-conservation tips developed by Kresge College students as part of a month-long outreach campaign in March 2009.</p><p>Reaching our water conservation goals will require a collective commitment from every member of the UCSC community. Whether you live on campus or off, I encourage you to begin implementing your own water-savings plans today. Each individual contribution, however small it may seem, will collectively make a real difference.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915adb918072704601a012ff19bd7e90"><name>2907</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Brittany Guest</title><summary>B.S., health sciences</summary><keywords>Brittany Guest, Special Olympics</keywords><description>B.S., health sciences</description><start-date>1240988400000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/04/2907</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/2907</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338904896</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338904896</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/04/images/guest.brittany.profile.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/04/images/guest.brittany.profile.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guest.brittany.profile.300.jpg</name><file-size>49935</file-size><width>300</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Brittany Guest (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Brittany Guest</p><p><b>Age:</b> 23</p><p><b>Major:</b> Health sciences</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Huntington Beach, CA</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Kresge</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why? </b> </p><p>My favorite class at UCSC was Human Physiology taught by Linda Ogren.

Field House pool repairs and boiler replacement project</strong></p>
<p>April 26-September 4 (possibly longer)</p>
<p>Workers will remove and replace the pool plaster, tile, and six feet of the surrounding concrete deck. Work also includes ADA upgrades to the parking lot, restrooms, shower, and locker facilities. Heating boilers will also be replaced during the pool shutdown. Work will be contained within the fenced area around the pool, half of the parking lot east of the East Field House building, part of the lobby at the first floor, and the men's and women's restrooms and locker facilities. The unisex locker room and the second floor will remain open, as will other buildings at the facility.</p>
<p>All disruptive work will be suspended during graduation weekend (June 12-14).</p>
<p>The pool will be shut down during the duration of the project. Demolition and replacement of the pool plaster and deck concrete will be noisy. All dust will be contained to the site and monitored. There will be a steady flow of construction vehicles to and from the site during the project along the service road, but all roads and paths will remain open.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and vehicle access around the project will remain open. Because of safety concerns, at times during certain phases of the work there will be provisions to redirect the pedestrian path of travel.</p>
<p><strong>Campus street striping</strong></p>
<p>August 25-September 11</p>
<p>Workers will repaint road striping, crosswalks, stop bars, and messages on campus primary and secondary roads.</p>
<p>There will be momentary delays at various locations on campus roads, crosswalks, and stop signs.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and vehicle access will be open during painting.</p>
<p><strong>Heller Road pavement rehabilitation--West Entrance to College Eight</strong></p>
<p>June 15-September 14</p>
<p>Work will include demolition of existing road, conform grinding, grading, excavation, installation of hot mix asphalt full roadway overlay, and road striping.</p>
<p>Two-way traffic control will be in place. Expect up to three-minute delays in both directions. Construction will be noisy because of large construction equipment. Cyclists should be aware of elevation changes in the road during construction.</p>
<p>Vehicle and pedestrian access will be open during construction.</p>
<p><strong>Kerr Hall, Crown, and Merrill stairway replacement</strong></p>
<p>July to mid September</p>
<p>All work locations will include demolition of existing asphalt pathways, installation of new concrete stairs, landings, steel handrails, and path lighting</p>
<p>Project includes four locations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kerr Hall main entrance:</strong> Area of work will extend from Steinhart down existing asphalt path to existing concrete deck. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Kerr Hall loading dock:</strong> Area of work will be at walkway next to existing retaining wall.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Crown bus stop:</strong> Area of work will extend from bus stop to Crown service road. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Merrill main entrance:</strong> Area of work is the path south of Merrill circle.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Alternate campus path routes should be used in all areas during construction. There will be noise from demolition and grading equipment.</p>
<p>Because of safety issues, there will be no access in these areas during construction.</p>
<p><strong>Crown kitchen grease interceptor replacement</strong></p>
<p>June 16-September 1</p>
<p>Workers will install a below-ground grease interceptor that will be used by the Crown kitchen. The exterior work areas affected will be between Banana Joe's/Crown Student Life Office/Vallier Hall. The exterior work will include an excavation for the grease interceptor and for piping to be run between the Crown kitchen and the grease interceptor location. The interior work is to replace all the kitchen waste piping in the crawl space beneath the kitchen. The Crown kitchen will be closed for the duration of the project. All kitchen maintenance and cleanings will be suspended until the completion of the project.</p>
<p>During Phase 1, there will be excavating equipment and construction vehicles traveling the Crown College service roads. There will be construction noise and minor disruptions during this phase of the project (jack hammers/trucks/excavator/back-up buzzers/crane).</p>
<p>Also during this phase, the foot traffic pathways adjacent to the excavation site will have disabled access available when needed. Normal pedestrian foot traffic will be re-routed around the excavation site. The contractor is to provide signage for the detour of the foot traffic. Phase 1 work is to be completed by July 5. There will be a large crane or forklift used to install the new grease interceptor. On that date, which is yet to be determined, for approximately four hours there will be emergency access only to any foot traffic surrounding the excavation site.</p>
<p>During Phase 2, there will not be any impact to the campus.</p>

<p><strong>21-kilovolt cable and switch replacement</strong></p>
<p>This project is wrapping up and should be completed by June 1.</p>
<p>The next date workers we will be working on the Campus 21kv electrical system is tentatively May 16. They will fine-tune the control relays, re-seat three 21kv bushings, install a small 12kv transformer, and synchronize relay. They plan to do this work on a Saturday so that if there happens to be an un-planned power outage classes will not be affected. The work is tentatively scheduled for 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. May 16.</p>
<p>The work will be done at Merrill Substation, which is above the Chadwick Garden. Officials do not anticipate any restricted access or traffic disruptions.</p>
<p>As the contractor is modifying the switch and breaker control wiring, it may cause a breaker to open, resulting in power outage. But that scenario is not likely. Officials will send out a notice to the campus to that effect on May 1 and will ask that anyone working on sensitive projects requiring electricity or cooling without backup power to wait until the work is done. They also recommend that sensitive equipment be turned off that day.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. (As water restrictions are in effect in Santa Cruz, please turn the water off between wetting your hands and rinsing them.) Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Try to avoid close contact with sick people.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>If you get sick with flu, it is recommended that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.</li>

<p>Yager will come to Santa Cruz from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where he is Distinguished Professor and Wilson Elkins Professor of Visual Arts&#8212;and founder/executive director of the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture, founder/director of the Innovation and Design Lab, and founder/past director of the Imaging Research Center.</p>
<p>Yager is also a photographer who has exhibited nationally and internationally, and has lectured throughout the U.S. His work can be found in the permanent collections of such major institutions as the Chicago Art Institute and the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p>Yager&#8217;s most recent accomplishment is his collaboration with the National Academy of Science on &#8220;Visual Culture and BioScience,&#8221; available as an online symposium and book.</p>
<p>&#8220;With over 25 years of experience as both an academic administrator and as a visionary of the arts, David Yager is an ideal choice to lead the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division,&#8221; noted UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has an extensive track record in creating new and innovative undergraduate and graduate programs, and in successfully collaborating with a wide variety of campus and community partners,&#8221; Blumenthal added.</p>
<p>During a 12-year tenure as chair of the UMBC Visual Arts department, Yager attracted national attention for the department&#8217;s emerging research programs. In 1989, he founded the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture to explore social and cultural issues linked to visual arts&#8212;focusing on how design can contribute to solutions that directly address social problems.</p>
<p>In 2006, Yager founded the Innovation and Design Laboratory, where he works with graduate students and industries to create and publish new knowledge in the health and wellness fields in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Medical Institution. As an artist and designer, he researches and oversees the design of new technologies and processes to simplify and enhance health care delivery to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Yager was also instrumental in helping UMBC to establish the first M.F.A. program in imaging and digital arts in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting opportunity for me to be part of an incredibly talented, research-oriented, and forward-thinking faculty,&#8221; Yager noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;As dean, there are some important opportunities to expand the arts and UCSC&#8217;s recognition on a regional and national level, and I look forward to helping build new and broad community support for the arts,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Yager holds an honorary Doctor of Art and Design degree from DeMontfort University in the U.K. He earned his B.A. from the University of Connecticut and his M.F.A. from Florida State University.</p>
<p>He will succeed Acting Dean David Evan Jones who has served as interim UCSC dean of the arts since September of 2008.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26b3efa8072704601a012ff8ba5c811"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2009/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625191630</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625191630</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
