<p>Like many students, he didn't always know what he wanted to study.</p>
<p>"I started to write because that's what people said I was good at," said Rosen, who's now an assistant editor at the campus's student-run satirical newspaper, <em>Fish Rap Live!.</em> "I got involved with the drama department at my high school and people said I was good at that, so I considered theater. Then, I developed a keen interest in political science, and people told me I should be a politician."</p>
<p>Apparently, since that was the last thing anyone told him he was good at, it's now his major.</p>
<p>"Hopefully nobody ever tells me that I'm good at anything else, ever, because then I might change my field of study," Rosen joked.</p>
<p>With a voice that drips with wit and friendly sarcasm, it's apparent from the start that humor is, perhaps, Rosen's most obvious calling--but politics is his passion.</p>
<p>His trick is intertwining the two.</p>
<p>Making politics funny, he said, makes it easier to digest.</p>
<p>"Humor de-fragments politics into some sort of digestible content, because otherwise it's very intimidating for people who aren't interested in that field," Rosen said.</p>
<p>Some politicians, however, are making a concentrated effort to take humor and satire out of politics because they think making it funny strips it of dignity, he said--which, of course, only gives ammunition to the satirists and humorists. (One only need watch one episode of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to observe this.)</p>
<p>The recent election has only fueled Rosen's interest in his field of study, to say the least.</p>
<p>"I turned into a political junkie," said Rosen. "I would come home from my politics class, turn on the news, kick on my computer, and just start doing searches on anything related to the election. I learned ridiculous amounts of information."</p>
<p>Rosen got his start in UCSC publications during his freshman year, when he was enrolled in an <em>Introduction to Magazine Publishing</em> course. Now, in addition to serving as an assistant editor at <em>Fish Rap Live!,</em> he's a senior staff writer and illustrator at the campus arts and literature journal <em>Rapt.</em></p>
<p>Joining the two publications improved his writing and widened his social circle.</p>
<p>"I started meeting important members of the community," he said. "It was nice to see the people who I was supposed to be like, eventually."</p>
<p>When pondering his future after graduation, Jared proclaims immediately, "I plan on going into a series of high-scale expeditions into the Alaskan wilderness."</p>
<p>While certainly plausible given his well-rounded academic experience at UCSC, the absurdity of this plan is quickly revealed with a laugh, and an explanation of his intent to obtain a public service job in the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>Clearly, Jared's multifaceted education will help him become a citizen with much to offer.</p>

<p>Monday, Jan. 5, 2009</p>
<p>University of California Office of the President (510) 987-9200</p>

<p>STATEMENT</p>
<p>University of California President Mark G. Yudof has issued the following statement on the 2009-10 state budget proposal of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger:</p>
<p>At both the state and federal levels, investment in human capital is the best investment our elected leaders can make to stimulate economic recovery. Public higher education in California has a proud record of contributing richly to our state's economic development by providing the educated workforce and research innovations that are critical for economic vitality.</p>
<p>In the context of the current state fiscal crisis, the governor's budget proposal does not provide the funding increase the Regents sought for 2009-10 in order to fund enrollment growth, cover increasing energy costs and other inflationary costs, and prevent a student fee increase at the University of California. This absence of funding will create substantial challenges for the university, coming on top of the historic underfunding that has affected all segments of public higher education in California. We also are concerned about the impact on UC medical centers of the Medi-Cal proposals in the budget.</p>
<p>The outlook is not entirely bleak. The budget avoids dramatically deeper cuts from present levels for the university's core academic operations, and it includes some bond funding for critical facilities projects. I believe these actions signify the governor's understanding of higher education's role in stimulating economic recovery.</p>
<p>The budget does include an assumption of substantial student fee increases for 2009-10, which of course come at a difficult time for many families. The Regents will discuss these issues further before settling on final fee levels for 2009-10, and we will continue to pay close attention to the role of financial aid in reducing the "sticker price" of student fees for many families. We will seek to preserve affordability to the greatest extent possible given the multiple financial pressures on the state and the university.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with the governor and Legislature in the coming weeks on a budget that addresses the state's immediate needs and also positions California to return strongly to a period of economic growth.</p>

It offers a first glimpse into the star-forming region of a galaxy from the early universe.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The brilliant afterglow of a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB) has enabled astronomers to probe the star-forming environment of a distant galaxy, resulting in the first detection of molecular gas in a GRB host galaxy. By analyzing the spectrum of light emitted in the GRB afterglow, the researchers are gleaning insights into an active stellar nursery in a galaxy so far away it appears as it was 11.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>"This observation required a rare and exceptionally bright event to allow us to probe the fragile environment where stars were forming just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang. After correcting for the extreme dust extinction, this is intrinsically the second brightest GRB afterglow to date; it would have been easily observed with amateur telescopes, if not for the dust in the way," said Jason X. Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Prochaska's team presented its findings at the American Astronomical Society meeting this week in Long Beach, Calif. A paper describing the results has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>
<p>Stars form in vast clouds of molecular gas and dust, and astronomers have expected to find evidence of these molecular clouds in GRB host galaxies. Until now, however, efforts to detect molecular gas in GRB afterglow spectra had been unsuccessful. The new observations by Prochaska and his coauthors indicate that star formation in the early universe occurred in environments similar to star-forming regions in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The study focused on a "long duration" gamma-ray burst known as GRB 080607. This type of burst is thought to occur when a massive star collapses to form a black hole. The initial burst of high-energy gamma rays was followed by a slowly fading afterglow of radiation over the entire spectrum of wavelengths.</p>
<p>"We suspect that previous events like 080607 were too faint to be observed on Earth," said coauthor Yaron Sheffer of the University of Toledo. "Many so-called dark bursts, with no observable afterglow, probably mark the dusty, highly extinguished environments of young star-forming regions."</p>
<p>NASA's Swift satellite detected the gamma-ray burst and began x-ray observations, while alerting astronomers and triggering automatic observations by ground-based telescopes such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory. Team members Joshua Bloom, Daniel Perley, and Adam Miller of UC Berkeley happened to be using the Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and began spectroscopic observations within 15 minutes using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS).</p>
<p>The resulting spectrum of the optical afterglow yielded information about the dust, gas, and metals in the interstellar medium through which the light passed on its way out of the host galaxy. In addition to the first clear detection of molecular gases (both carbon monoxide and hydrogen), the spectrum indicated a metal composition comparable to that of the Sun (to astronomers, "metals" are elements heavier than hydrogen and helium).</p>
<p>The spectrum also has many features researchers have never seen before, Prochaska said. In addition to hundreds of standard absorption lines corresponding to known transitions of various elements, the spectrum shows many absorption lines that researchers have yet to identify.</p>
<p>"This is easily the most fascinating spectrum that I've ever worked on," Prochaska said. "Nearly half of the features remain a mystery, and it is possible that no one has ever detected them previously, either in controlled laboratory experiments or in spectra from our galaxy or other galaxies."</p>
<p>There is also more hydrogen in this spectrum than along any path through the Milky Way, he added. "This remains a bit of a puzzle," Prochaska said. "For now, we don't know much about the galaxy that hosted the explosion, but the evidence suggests it has been prodigious in terms of star formation."</p>
<p>The burst and its afterglow were observed in June, and the team did not manage to get images of the host galaxy before it moved to a position in the sky where it could not be observed. In January, the researchers will image the galaxy to connect their findings on the star-forming region with its global properties.</p>
<p>In addition to Prochaska, Sheffer, Perley, Miller, and Bloom, the coauthors include Laura Lopez of UC Santa Cruz; Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky of the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland; Hsiao-Wen Chen of the University of Chicago; and Alex Filippenko, Mo Ganeshalingam, Weidong Li, and Dan Starr of UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>This research was supported by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the TABASGO Foundation.</p>

The art works created by each of the 20 commissioned artists will play in a continuous rotation-free of any commercial content.</p><p>Lord said he will incorporate images for the project that he has been collecting for the past several years. Titled "To and From LAX," his piece will offer a portrait of the global infrastructure of air travel through the use of photos and videos that have been shot in public spaces at more than 25 airports, as well as inflight. </p><p>"The work is in the tradition of documentary photographers such as Walker Evans and Robert Frank, whose work has been exhibited in galleries and museums, and suggests a melding of the boundaries between documentary and fine arts photography," said Lord.  </p><p>Lord is now busy gathering images and video footage and hopes to begin editing this spring. He expects to complete his project in fall 2009, and the installation is scheduled to open to the public in 2010. </p><p>"The artists will be assisted by LAX technical staff in the final stage of post-production," Lord added. "This has to do with programming the delivery of footage to the 25-screen matrix-which is a device that radically expands the possibilities of conventional film delivery."</p><p>Lord currently has an art installation on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in collaboration with two former members of the legendary Ant Farm architecture collective he co-founded-Bruce Tomb and Curtis Schreier. The work is part of an exhibition called <i>The Art of Participation: 1950-Now</i>.</p><p>Titled "Media Van v.08," the piece is a media sculpture that invites viewers to access a DVD showing vintage black and white video from 1970-as well as contribute to an ever-growing data bank by donating a file or image into the van's "Media Huqquh," a hookah-shaped digital time capsule to be opened in 2030. </p><p>When visitors to the van sculpture at SFMOMA donate a file by plugging their hand-held digital device (camera, iPod, MP3 player, iPhone, memory stick) into the "Huqquh," the images will be displayed live in the gallery. The contents of the time capsule will continue to grow until the week before the exhibit ends. </p><p>"The project is a rethinking of the 1971 Ant Farm Media van, which we toured the country in, shooting video with the first-generation Sony portapak," said Lord. "We found the original van in the Santa Cruz mountains, but we decided that in 2008 it should be a post-internal combustion vehicle, so the engine and drive train were removed."</p><p>"We are showing vintage video from the 1971 Ant Farm Truckstop Tour and also collecting files for the year 2030, so the project has a time span of 60 years," Lord added.</p><p>Lord noted that the artists will host a "closing and sealing" event at SFMOMA on Jan. 29 at 7 p.m., after which the contents of the time capsule will be exhibited as a slide show until the exhibition closes on Feb. 8, 2009. </p><p>The Media van will then travel to Nantes, France, where it will be exhibited and a second time capsule will be created as part of the 2009 Estuarie Biennale, a contemporary art exhibition that takes place every two years along the Loire estuary. </p><p>					</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9159543f8072704601a012ff4f9dabfa"><name>2662</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;'s Sunday front page featured a story about a first-of-its-kind project led by researchers from UC Santa Cruz attempting to track Bay Area mountain lions.</summary><description>The &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;'s Sunday front page featured a story about a first-of-its-kind project led by researchers from UC Santa Cruz attempting to track Bay Area mountain lions.</description><start-date>1231743600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2662</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2662</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338804717</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338804717</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/01/images/sf_chronicle_01_11_08.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/01/images/sf_chronicle_01_11_08.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sf_chronicle_01_11_08.jpg</name><file-size>140153</file-size><width>280</width><height>494</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <em><strong>San Francisco Chronicle</strong></em>'s Sunday, January 11, front page featured a story about a first-of-its-kind project led by researchers from UC Santa Cruz attempting to track Bay Area mountain lions, which are being seen in greater numbers as urban areas spread into the region's wildlands.</p>

Photo by Paul Cross.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Last winter, government agencies killed one third of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd due to concerns about the possible spread of a livestock disease to cattle that graze in areas around the park. Such drastic measures may be unnecessary, however, according to researchers who have assessed the risk of disease transmission from Yellowstone bison to cattle.</p>
<p>"There are more cost-effective management solutions than the current approach, which has been highly controversial," said Marm Kilpatrick, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author of the new study.</p>
<p>The alternatives suggested by the study, such as buying grazing rights from cattle ranchers in a few areas around the park or testing all cattle within a special zone around the park, are not new ideas. But Kilpatrick said his group's quantitative risk assessment highlights the substantial benefits of these strategies, as well as their consequences. He worked with Colin Gillin of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in Corvallis and Peter Daszak of the Consortium for Conservation Medicine in New York on the study, which is scheduled for publication in the February issue of the British Ecological Society's <em>Journal of Applied Ecology</em> and will be published online January 12.</p>
<p>The researchers developed a quantitative risk assessment model for the transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle in the Yellowstone area. Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that causes weight loss, abortion, and reduced milk production in cattle. It is considered a major threat to the cattle industry, which has achieved "brucellosis-free" status in most states after an intensive effort by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone bison herd probably became infected from cattle that grazed in the park a century ago, Kilpatrick said. Now, cattle ranchers want to keep the bison confined to the park. During severe winters, however, when heavy snow or ice covers grasslands within Yellowstone, many bison move outside the park's boundaries to graze at lower elevations. To keep them away from areas where cattle graze, state and federal agencies try to herd the bison back into the park by "hazing" them with helicopters, horses, and snowmobiles. When that fails, the bison may be shot or rounded up, tested, and shipped to slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick and his coauthors sought to quantify the risk of brucellosis transmission to cattle under a range of different scenarios. Their study showed that the risk is very low in most years and is periodically high only in certain localized areas.</p>
<p>"There are just a few areas where cattle graze around the park. Compensating ranchers for the grazing rights for those areas would be much more cost-effective than the current management plan," Kilpatrick said. Efforts to acquire key habitat outside the park for the bison are being pursued, but the process has been lengthy and challenging, he said.</p>
<p>Another proposal has been to consider the greater Yellowstone area of Montana as a separate zone from the rest of the state in terms of brucellosis infection status and to provide yearly testing of all cattle within that zone. The cost would be just a fraction of the amount spent by government agencies on the current management strategy, which was estimated in 2000 to be about $2.5 million per year, Kilpatrick said. Similarly, compensating ranchers for the value of all the cattle that graze on public and private lands around the park (assuming they would sell their rights), would cost about half the current yearly amount.</p>
<p>"To me, the most interesting result of the study was that in a number of years, the model predicts there will be no risk of transmission at all," Kilpatrick said. "Even with the bison population at 7,000--the largest population size in our simulations--there was zero risk 10 to 15 percent of the time, because even when some bison leave the park, they don't always give birth and leave infected birthing materials."</p>
<p>To transmit brucellosis to cattle, an infected bison would have to enter an area where cattle graze and abort or give birth, leaving infected tissue on the ground, and cattle would then have to contact the infected material while the bacteria in it were still alive.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick noted that so far there have been no documented cases of brucellosis transmission from unconfined bison to cattle, although transmission from elk to cattle has occurred several times around feed grounds. Blood tests show that about half the Yellowstone bison herd has antibodies indicating exposure to the brucellosis bacteria, but it's much harder to determine if an animal is actually infected, he said.</p>
<p>Vaccination efforts are currently under way to reduce the prevalence of brucellosis in the bison herd. Eliminating the disease entirely would be very difficult without rounding up all the bison and vaccinating every animal for several years in a row, Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of brucellosis, however, management challenges would remain, he said. Without periodic culling, the Yellowstone bison population will continue to grow and could reach 7,000 by 2012. As the population grows, more bison will tend to leave the park, and the massive animals are not particularly respectful of fences and property lines.</p>
<p>"Bison used to roam the plains in the millions, and they will try to do so again as their population grows," said coauthor Peter Daszak. "Ultimately, our society will have to decide whether to let bison roam freely or continue shooting them. It's a tough challenge, but hopefully our analysis provides a way forward for alternative approaches."</p>
<p>There are other bison herds on public and private lands in the United States, but the Yellowstone herd is the only one that has remained free-ranging and unconfined. A record number of Yellowstone bison--about 1,600--were killed last winter. With the herd now reduced to about 3,000 animals, a repeat of that is unlikely this year, Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>But the controversy over how to manage the herd is bound to continue.</p>
<p>"I hope this study improves the understanding of the overall situation and enables implementation of new management approaches," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>Funding for the study was provided by the Wilburforce Foundation, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation.</p>

<p>She visited UCSC as part of Kids Around the University, an experience that made a lasting impression. "It was a tremendous step for me," Maldonado remembered Friday. From then on, "college was always in my mind."</p>
<p>Maldonado, now a fourth-year math major with a goal of obtaining a Ph.D. in education, recalled her visit as the EPC celebrated 10 years of making college more than a dream, of making it a reality for thousands of students like her in the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley regions.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for (EPC), I wouldn't be here today," Maldonado said, noting that no one in her family had completed junior high. Today, she also works at EPC.</p>
<p>The EPC continued and expanded the concept of Kids Around the University - giving younger students a glimpse at the possibility of college. It coordinates academic preparation efforts in area schools with the goal of increasing access to college for students from low-income and traditionally non-college-going families.</p>
<p>Friday's ceremony at University Center honored EPC's six founders and 12 individuals and organizations that are partners with the center. Carrol Moran, EPC's executive director since its inception, thanked the founders, calling them her mentors. Also attending were 150 former students, partners, parents, faculty members and founders.</p>
<p>In opening remarks, Chancellor George Blumenthal said the "vision and leadership" of the founders was "paramount to establishing the center as well as sustaining and expanding its programs and services." He said he hopes the innovative academic preparation program can be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Founders include Chancellor Emeritus Karl Pister; Martin Chemers, professor of psychology, Francisco Hernandez, former vice chancellor of student affairs, now vice chancellor for students, University of Hawaii at Manoa; Joyce Justus, former vice president for educational relations at the UC Office of the President; and J. Michael Thompson former associate vice chancellor, enrollment management, now CEO of Xap Corp. The sixth founder, former chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, was unable to attend.</p>
<p>Since 1998, the percentage of high school graduates from EPC's five original partner schools who enroll at a UC campus has doubled and now exceeds the statewide average.</p>
<p>Since its inception, EPC has also doubled the numbers of underrepresented students from Monterey Bay Area partner schools who apply to, are accepted, and enroll in UC or CSU schools.</p>
<p>The EPC's partners are area schools, corporations and foundations. Recipients of its 2009 Partner Awards are:</p>

MacKenzie.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jacob Rosen is developing a wearable robotic "exoskeleton" that could enable a person to lift heavy objects with little effort. It's a bit like the robotic armor that has long been a staple of futuristic battle scenes in science fiction books and movies. But what excites Rosen is the device's potential to help people disabled by stroke or degenerative diseases. </p><p>"People with muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disabilities could use the exoskeleton to amplify their muscle strength, and it could also be used for rehabilitation and physical therapy," said Rosen, an associate professor of computer engineering in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>"One of the major challenges in this field is to establish an effective human-machine interface, or 'bio-port,' between the operator and the wearable robot, such that the robot becomes a natural extension of the human body," he said. "This bio-port may be established at the neural level, allowing the human brain to control the wearable robot with the same type of signals that it uses to control its own actuators, the muscles."</p><p>Rosen, who came to UCSC last year, joins a growing number of faculty members in the Baskin School of Engineering who are using their expertise to tackle biomedical problems. His medical robotics projects include a remotely operated robotic system for performing surgical operations, as well as the exoskeleton and related topics. </p><p>Rosen's research focuses especially on the interface and interaction between humans and robots in these systems. "Medical robotics is by definition a multidisciplinary field, and that's one reason I was so attracted to it," he said. "One of the most challenging issues in research and development of medical technology is to create a multidisciplinary group of clinicians and engineers that can effectively communicate and collaborate. We speak different languages, and we have to overcome these barriers in order to work together. But the opportunities to benefit people's lives are tremendous." </p><p>Rosen's current exoskeleton prototype, developed with a grant from the National Science Foundation, consists of two wearable robotic arms mounted on one wall of his UCSC laboratory. Inserting his arms into it, he notes that serious injury could result from a bad mismatch between the structure of the exoskeleton and the anatomical structure of the human arm. </p><p>Two innovations distinguish Rosen's prototype from other exoskeleton designs. One is a special design of the exoskeleton arms that allows the user to reach 95 percent of the natural range of motion, or "workspace," of the human arm. The other, which is still the subject of active research, is a method for using neurological signals to control the exoskeleton.</p><p>"By using the body's own control signals as input to the exoskeleton, you can achieve a natural control of the robot by the human operator as an extension of his or her body," Rosen said.</p><p>The system uses noninvasive surface electromyography (EMG), in which surface electrodes placed on the skin detect neural activity in individual muscles or muscle groups. The system takes advantage of a natural physiological time delay between the neural activation of a muscle and the actual movement generated by contraction of the muscle. During that time delay, a computer algorithm can analyze and process the EMG signals, which are then fed into computer models of the muscular system along with additional information regarding joint position and velocity. </p><p>The muscle models predict the joint movements that the operator's muscles will generate in response to the neural signals detected by EMG, and these predictions are then sent to the exoskeleton so that it moves in concert with the operator's arm. </p><p>Rosen has demonstrated this system for control of a single joint (flexing and extending the elbow). Now he is working to implement it to control the more complicated movements of the full exoskeleton arm, with funding from the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technologies Research Center. He is also working on a lower limb exoskeleton to fit over the legs.</p><p>Some potential applications of the exoskeleton would not necessarily require the neuromuscular control system. For physical therapy, for example, the exoskeleton could be programmed to help a patient perform predetermined movements, Rosen said. </p><p>"When a stroke affects the motor cortex, there is typically paralysis on one side of the body. Rehabilitation relies on the plasticity of the brain to regain movement, but the learning process requires a lot of time in physical therapy," he said. </p><p>Motor control in the brain may be reduced to the level of an infant first learning to engage with the world, he said. For an adult, it is frustrating and challenging, both physically and intellectually.</p><p>"The patient's progress is often limited by the amount of time they're able to spend with a physical therapist, so an automated physical therapy device could speed up the recovery process, and adding a virtual reality component may make it more intellectually engaging," Rosen said.</p><p>The exoskeleton can also be used to provide force feedback in a virtual reality system--to create the sensation of holding or interacting with virtual objects, for example. "Haptic" technology provides an interface with the user through the sense of touch, and using the exoskeleton as a haptic device has many applications in scientific visualization and manipulation, gaming, and simulation, Rosen said. Haptic feedback is also needed in surgical robotics to give the surgeon a sense of touch as he operates the robot from a separate console that may be located in a remote site, Rosen said.</p><p>Rosen was a partner in a major research and development project, led by SRI and funded by DARPA, which envisioned the operating room of the future as a fully automated cell that includes only one human being--the patient--while a surgeon remotely controls a surgical robot and other automated systems. The project showed that an operating room can be fully automated, but there are enormous obstacles to achieving automation of the surgical procedure itself. Even automating something as routine as placing sutures requires sophisticated models of the biomechanics of soft tissue.</p><p>"This is a huge challenge. I'll probably spend a large part of my career on this," Rosen said.</p><p>Skeptics argue that there is no need to create robots to do what is already being done safely and effectively by surgeons. But a surgical robot can provide manipulations and views of anatomical structures and surgical sites that are not accessible to human fingers or within the line of sight of a surgeon. Rosen, who is currently editing a book on surgical robotics, argues that robotic systems could enable surgeons to explore procedures that would not otherwise be possible. "Sometimes you have to provide the tool first, and then people discover how they can use it," he said.</p><p>Rosen and his collaborators plan to build a surgical robot in his new lab at UCSC. If he can get sufficient funding, he'd like to build seven duplicate systems and give them to other research groups throughout the United States. "The more people there are developing new algorithms for surgical robotics, the faster the field will progress," he said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91595e0b8072704601a012ff62a26b2e"><name>2669</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>"What Now?" video-UCSC professors assess impact of presidential election</title><summary>In anticipation of the inauguration of America's 44th president, we invite you to watch a podcast of a recent event in San Francisco featuring two UCSC political experts. </summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496;

It's a bit like the robotic armor that has long been a staple of futuristic battle scenes in science fiction books and movies. But what excites Rosen is the device's potential to help people disabled by stroke or degenerative diseases. </p><p>"People with muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disabilities could use the exoskeleton to amplify their muscle strength, and it could also be used for rehabilitation and physical therapy," Rosen said. </p><p>"One of the major challenges in this field is to establish an effective human-machine interface, or 'bio-port,' between the operator and the wearable robot, such that the robot becomes a natural extension of the human body," he said. "This bio-port may be established at the neural level, allowing the human brain to control the wearable robot with the same type of signals that it uses to control its own actuators, the muscles."</p><p>Rosen joins a growing number of faculty members in Baskin Engineering who are using their expertise to tackle biomedical problems. Rosen's research focuses especially on the interface and interaction between humans and robots. </p><p>"Medical robotics is by definition a multidisciplinary field, and that's one reason I was so attracted to it," he said.  "One of the most challenging issues in research and development of medical technology is to create a multidisciplinary group of clinicians and engineers that can effectively communicate and collaborate. We speak different languages, and we have to overcome these barriers in order to work together. But the opportunities to benefit people's lives are tremendous." </p><p>Rosen's current exoskeleton prototype, developed with a grant from the National Science Foundation, consists of two wearable robotic arms mounted on one wall of his UCSC laboratory. Inserting his arms into it, he notes that serious injury could result from a bad mismatch between the structure of the exoskeleton and the anatomical structure of the human arm. </p><p>Two innovations distinguish Rosen's prototype from other exoskeleton designs.  One is a special design of the exoskeleton arms that allows the user to reach 95 percent of the natural range of motion, or "workspace," of the human arm. The other, which is still the subject of active research, is a method for using neurological signals to control the exoskeleton.</p><p>Rosen is also engaged in projects to develop robotic systems for performing surgical operations. "This is a huge challenge. I'll probably spend a large part of my career on this," he said.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/home">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a> at the University of California, Santa Cruz, prepares technologists--and sponsors technology--for our changing world.

Ruby Rich, who will moderate a panel discussion about the emerging crisis during the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p>"There is a crisis in free speech that's affecting filmmakers," said Rich, a professor and chair of the Community Studies Department and Social Documentation Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Filmmakers are attracting new enemies precisely because of the power of documentary. I want to put this on people's radar, because it is a major threat facing anyone doing documentary work."</p>
<p>In her 21st year at Sundance, Rich will chair the panel discussion, "Truth and Consequences," on Wednesday, January 21, from 1:30 to 4 p.m. at the Filmmaker Lodge in Park City, Utah. She will be joined by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Hubert Sauper, who has been the target of a government-run hate campaign since his documentary <em>Darwin's Nightmare</em> exposed an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in Tanzania.</p>
<p>"Hubert Sauper made a very highly acclaimed film, and since the Oscar nomination, the Tanzanian government began to take notice of him," explained Rich. "He has been the subject of a hate campaign by the Tanzanian government and its proxies. He has been the subject of lawsuits; he has been banned from the country; there have been calls for his death; and the people who appeared in his film have been persecuted."</p>
<p>Sauper's experience is not isolated, noted Rich: Other filmmakers have been the targets of similar campaigns that included harassment, threats, and worse. Joining Rich and Sauper on the panel will be filmmaker Ngawang Choephel, who is premiering his film <em>Tibet in Song</em> during the festival. Choephel was a political prisoner, held by the Chinese in Tibetan prisons for eight years as a consequence of recording traditional Tibetan songs for his documentary. Also joining them is Anders Ostergaard, director of <em>Burma VJ</em>, a documentary about the Buddhist rebellion. Made up of videos shot by the Democratic Voice of Burma, the footage was smuggled into Thailand, shipped to Norway, and subsequently broadcast around the world.</p>
<p>"What does it mean for countries to insist that they can control their own image, like corporations putting copyrights on intellectual property?" asked Rich. "It will mean outsiders or opposition figures inside cannot do any documentary work without government sanction. It will have a chilling effect on the free speech of filmmakers and on the free trade of information."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, filmmakers are challenging these restrictions, including two graduate students in the Social Documentation Program at UC Santa Cruz who have investigated women factory workers in China who have been poisoned by toxins on the job and the displacement of Afro-Colombians from their lands in Colombia.</p>
<p>"This is a new crisis that needs to be recognized," said Rich. "We want to put it before the attention of the world documentary community at Sundance." The panel discussion is being organized by Rich and Cara Mertes, director of the documentary film program at Sundance Institute.</p>
<p>In addition, Rich will moderate a panel discussion about film, gay rights, and the passage in November of Proposition 8 in California, which eliminated the right to marry for gay and lesbian couples in the state. Panelists will include John Cooper, director of festival programming for the Sundance Film Festival; Rob Epstein, Oscar-winning director of <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em> and <em>Celluloid Closet</em>; Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation; Matt Coles, director of LGBT &amp; AIDS Projects for the ACLU; and Dayna Frank, cofounder of HOMOtracker &amp; Freedom-Action-Inclusion-Rights. The panel, "LGBT Civil Rights, Film Activism &amp; Prop. 8," takes place Sunday, January 18, at 2:30 p.m. in the Queer Lounge on Main Street in Park City.</p>

But the problem turns out to be less mysterious than it once seemed. A study published this week by <em>Science</em> shows how the growth of a massive star can proceed despite outward-flowing radiation pressure that exceeds the gravitational force pulling material inward.</p>
<p>The new findings also explain why massive stars tend to occur in binary or multiple star systems, said lead author Mark Krumholz, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The formation of companion stars emerged unexpectedly from the sophisticated computer simulations the researchers used to explore the physics of massive star formation.</p>
<p>"We didn't set out to solve that question, so it was a nice side benefit of the study," Krumholz said. "The main finding is that radiation pressure does not limit the growth of massive stars."</p>
<p>Radiation pressure is the force exerted by electromagnetic radiation on the surfaces it strikes. This effect is negligible for ordinary light, but it becomes significant in the interiors of stars due to the intensity of the radiation. In massive stars, radiation pressure is the dominant force counteracting gravity to prevent the further collapse of the star.</p>
<p>"When you apply the radiation pressure from a massive star to the dusty interstellar gas around it, which is much more opaque than the star's internal gas, it should explode the gas cloud," Krumholz said. Earlier studies suggested that radiation pressure would blow away the raw materials of star formation before a star could grow much larger than about 20 times the mass of the Sun. Yet astronomers observe stars much more massive than that.</p>
<p>Krumholz and his coauthors at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have spent years developing complex computer codes for simulating the processes of star formation. Combined with advances in computer technology, their latest software (called ORION) enabled them to run a detailed three-dimensional simulation of the collapse of an enormous interstellar gas cloud to form a massive star. The project required months of computing time at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.</p>
<p>The simulation showed that as the dusty gas collapses onto the growing core of a massive star, with radiation pressure pushing outward and gravity pulling material in, instabilities develop that result in channels where radiation blows out through the cloud into interstellar space, while gas continues falling inward through other channels.</p>
<p>"You can see fingers of gas falling in and radiation leaking out between those fingers of gas," Krumholz said. "This shows that you don't need any exotic mechanisms; massive stars can form through accretion processes just like low-mass stars."</p>
<p>The rotation of the gas cloud as it collapses leads to the formation of a disk of material feeding onto the growing "protostar." The disk is gravitationally unstable, however, causing it to clump and form a series of small secondary stars, most of which end up colliding with the central protostar. In the simulation, one secondary star became massive enough to break away and acquire its own disk, growing into a massive companion star. A third small star formed and was ejected into a wide orbit before falling back in and merging with the primary star.</p>
<p>When the researchers stopped the simulation, after allowing it to evolve for 57,000 years of simulated time, the two stars had masses of 41.5 and 29.2 times the mass of the Sun and were circling each other in a fairly wide orbit.</p>
<p>"What formed in the simulation is a common configuration for massive stars," Krumholz said. "I think we can now consider the mystery of how massive stars are able to form to be solved. The age of supercomputers and the ability to simulate the process in three dimensions made the solution possible."</p>
<p>The paper describing these results is being published by <em>Science</em> on the Science Express web site on January 15, 2009. In addition to Krumholz, the coauthors are Richard Klein, Christopher McKee, and Stella Offner of UC Berkeley, and Andrew Cunningham of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>
<p>This research was funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>

Questions about the Staff Advisor position or the application process should be directed to Randolph Scott, Executive Director, Strategic Planning and Workforce Development, Human Resources and Benefits at (510) 987-9996. </p><p>About the Staff Advisors to The Regents:</p><p>A continuing goal of the UC Regents is to foster two-way communication between UC staff and the Board.  In January 2007, The Regents voted unanimously to establish positions for two Staff Advisors to participate in their deliberative process and to provide a staff perspective on matters coming before the Board.  One new Staff Advisor is selected each year for a two year term.  The Staff Advisors serve as non-voting advisors to designated Regents' committees, and they attend and participate directly in committee and Board meetings throughout their term of service.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Non-Senate Academic Employees</audience><admin>Willeen McQuitta, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915969148072704601a012ff9a96db5b"><name>2677</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three faculty honored with emeriti professorships</title><summary>Three members of UCSC's faculty have been honored with emeriti professorships for the current academic year.</summary><author>Ken Christopher (831/459-2058)</author><description>Three members of UCSC's faculty have been honored with emeriti professorships for the current academic year.</description><start-date>1232434800000</start-date><display-name>Three faculty honored with...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2677</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2677</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338810062</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338810062</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three members of UCSC's faculty have been honored with emeriti professorships for the current academic year, Campus Provost David Kliger and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Alison Galloway have announced.</p><p>Professor Emeritus of Literature Harry Berger, Professor Emeritus of Sociology G. William Domhoff, and Professor Emerita of Politics and Legal Studies Isebill (Ronnie) Gruhn have each been awarded an Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorships.  These awards will fund the teaching of courses by these retired faculty through the spring quarter.</p><p>Harry Berger was appointed at UCSC in 1965, serving as a founding faculty member of Cowell College.  A specialist in English and Comparative Renaissance Literature, particularly in Spenser and Shakespeare, Professor Berger is an internationally recognized scholar whose work has made a significant impact on literary and cultural studies of the early modern period. A book dedicated to his work, <i>A Touch More Rare:  Harry Berger, Jr. and the Arts of Interpretation,</i> will appear from Fordham University Press in 2009.  In addition to teaching at UCSC, he continues to lead seminars for faculty and students for such venues as the Newberry Library and the Shakespeare Society of America. </p><p>G. William (Bill) Domhoff is also a founding member of the UCSC faculty, and has pursued two scholarly interests - dreams and power relations - with great zeal throughout his career.  In 2007, in recognition of his many accomplishments, he was the recipient of the University of California's Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, which recognizes the post retirement contributions of UC faculty.  In early 2008, Professor Domhoff was selected to deliver that year's annual Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC, "The Awesome Lawfulness of your Nightly Dreams."</p><p>Ronnie Gruhn, an expert in international politics who has focused on Africa, international and transnational institutions, and relations between rich and poor states, joined UCSC in 1969.  Since her retirement, she has remained very active in teaching, serving as an adviser, and organizing forums on our national elections and international issues.  She currently serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Emeriti Relations and is an ex-officio member of the Faculty Welfare Committee.  Among her many honors, Professor Gruhn received the Social Science Division's "Golden Apple" award in 2000 for outstanding teaching.</p><p>The Dickson Professorship is the result of a gift from Edward A. Dickson, who served as a Regent of the University of California from 1913 to 1946, the longest tenure of any Regent.  In 1955 Mr. Dickson presented the University with an endowment to support special annual professorships to be awarded to retired faculty members.  Every year, each campus in the UC system receives a portion of the income from this endowment to fund these professorships.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91596a7d8072704601a012ffce674977"><name>2678</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Chris Darimont's research on the impact of commercial fishing and hunting on the size and reproductive patterns of fish and other species was covered by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times,&lt;/i&gt; NPR, Reuters, the BBC, and many other media outlets.</summary><description>Chris Darimont's research on the impact of commercial fishing and hunting on the size and reproductive patterns of fish and other species was covered by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times,&lt;/i&gt; NPR, Reuters, the BBC, and many other media outlets.</description><start-date>1232434800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2678</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2678</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338810440</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338810440</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Postdoctoral researcher Chris Darimont of environmental studies hit a media home run with a paper about the impact of commercial fishing and hunting on the size and reproductive patterns of fish and other species.

<p>Numbers released today by UC's Office of the President showed one-year increases at UCSC of 13.8 and 11.5 percent, respectively, in freshman and transfer applications. These increases compared to a UC systemwide increase of 9.2 in freshman applications and 8.5 percent in transfer applications received at the university's nine general campuses.</p>

"These numbers not only are testimony to the quality of UCSC's people and programs," said Michael McCawley, UCSC's acting director of admissions. "They reflect the growing awareness throughout California of that quality."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Prospective undergraduates submitted fall 2008 applications during the university's "priority filing" period of November 1-30.</p>
<p>During that month, a total of 27,810 prospective freshmen applied to UC Santa Cruz, compared with 24,436 applicants for fall 2007. A total of 5,245 applicants to UCSC are seeking to transfer from another college or university, up from 4,960 transfer applications for the previous fall.</p>
<p>Increases among prospective freshmen and transfer students were seen in applications in all five of UCSC's academic divisions: Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences. The largest increases were experienced in the Baskin School of Engineering (up 48 percent) and in Social Sciences (up 28.6 percent).</p>
<p>Among prospective freshmen, a new major in Engineering-Bioengineering-drew 413 applications in its first year; and in its second year, the Computer Game Design major attracted 462 applications. In Social Sciences, the Business Management Economics major attracted 2,233 applications, and Psychology drew 1,642 applications. In Physical and Biological Sciences, the Biology major attracted 1,774 applications; Marine Biology, 623; and Health Sciences, 542. In Humanities, applications in the Literature and History majors totaled 1,058 and 481, respectively. In the Arts, Film and Digital Media drew the interest of 608 applicants and the major in Art attracted 441.</p>
<p>Approximately one-third of the prospective freshmen applied to UCSC with an undeclared major.</p>
<p>Applications to the campus from traditionally underrepresented groups also increased, rising 25 and 9.7 percent, respectively, from prospective freshmen and transfer students.</p>
<p>"It's important that the ethnic diversity of UCSC's students more closely mirror the state we serve," McCawley said. "So we are very pleased to see gains of this size, particularly among prospective freshmen."</p>
<p>Among freshman applications to UCSC, all ethnic groups experienced increases for fall 2008: African American, from 759 last year to 972 this year, or 28.1 percent; American Indian, from 154 last year to 180 this year, or 16.9 percent; Asian American, from 9,215 to 10,144, or 10.1 percent; Chicano/Latino, from 7,290 to 9,262, or 24.8 percent; Filipino American, from 856 to 889, or 3.9 percent; and White/other, from 10,048 to 11,069, or 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>Applications from students who did not state an ethnicity also increased, from 1,095 to 1,321, or 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>For fall 2008, UC Santa Cruz is planning to enroll 3,700 new freshmen and 850 new transfer students. McCawley said this target for freshman enrollment remains the same as the number of enrolled freshmen in fall 2007; this target for transfer students is 50 more than the number who enrolled in fall 2007.</p>
<p>"Since our undergraduate enrollment targets are essentially unchanged from this past fall, the increase in applications will make our selection process more competitive than ever," McCawley said.</p>
<p>Applicants to UCSC will be notified of admission decisions beginning on March 15. Admitted freshmen will have until May 1 to file a "statement of intent to register," indicating their intention to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. The deadline for transfers is June 1.</p>

<p>The annual Nonprofit, Social Services &amp; Government Job Fair attracted almost 400 job-seekers to the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room.</p>
<p>Two groups--the Santa Cruz Campus Anti-War Network and a group of students from Colleges Nine and Ten--organized educational booths outside the event. People were stopping at the two tables to talk, get buttons, and grab informational materials.</p>
<p>The fair was a "complete success," said Barbara Silverthorne, acting Career Center director. "Students connected with employers while members of two groups outside peacefully exercised their right to speak out against military recruiting on campus," Silverthorne said. "Given the current economic climate, it is especially important for our career fairs to be productive so that our students are not deprived of their right to speak freely to all prospective employers."</p>
<p>Career fairs on campus featuring military recruiters have prompted vigorous dissent in the past. Last April, at the so-called "Last Chance Job &amp; Internship Fair," protestors marched from Quarry Plaza to the event. Shortly after the job fair began, they started banging on paint-can drums, carrying signs, shouting into bullhorns, and chanting slogans.</p>
<p>Military recruiters left the campus during the "Last Chance" fair in 2006, saying a protest that year was endangering staff and other students at the fair.</p>
<p>Employers at this year's Nonprofit, Social Services &amp; Government Job Fair included the UC Berkeley Labor Center, the San Francisco Police Department, Stanford University Department of Public Safety, the Peace Corps, California Highway Patrol, and Social Security. There were 22 employers in all.</p>
<p>Attendee Renee Terrebonne, 21, hesitated to come to the fair because she strongly disagrees with the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, and, she said, with "military violence in general."</p>
<p>But, she said, she needs a job, and she decided she'd simply pass by the Marines. Despite her stand on the military, she said it was "good they haven't been harassed."</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone deserves that," said Terrebonne, a College 10 senior studying feminist studies and sociology. "It wouldn't show them we're great people."</p>
<p>Job-seeker Abraham Mitnik, 23, was glad to see peaceful representation of the various points of view.</p>
<p>"The Marines are here. That's all right--they're not forcing themselves on anyone," said Mitnik, a former Oakes College student who just graduated with a history degree. "It's the protestors' right to protest, but they shouldn't infringe upon people who want to come here."</p>
<p>For the Marines, the fair was "going great," said Captain Brian Lionbarger, U.S. Marine Corps officer selection officer.</p>
<p>"It always feels good to come to this campus," Lionbarger said. "I always like coming here because of the quality of kids we get coming into our program."</p>
<p>Other employers agreed.</p>
<p>"This is a great job fair," said Robert Contreras, recruitment officer for Stanford University Department of Public Safety. "The students are very attentive, even if it's not their chosen field. They're asking good questions."</p>
<p>At the Santa Cruz Campus Anti-War Network table outside, Jasmin Vargas, 22, an environmental studies major in Merrill College, said the group wanted to give job-seekers "the information the military recruiters aren't giving them and make the connection between increased military spending and more economic debt."</p>
<p>"We want students who want to talk to the military to be educated, and we want to tell them they have different options," she said.</p>

Over the past several years, he has directed two summer institutes on that very topic at the site of the first ghetto in Venice, Italy-in collaboration with the University of Venice and funded with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>The result is an exhibition now at the Museo ItaloAmericano through Feb 15 titled <i>Il Ghetto: Forging Italian Jewish Identities 1516-1870</i> that looks at more than 350 years of Jewish life in Italy-the gateway through which Jewish culture in Europe was established. </p><p>"I was the academic resource and consultant, and worked extensively with the curator to develop the exhibit," said Baumgarten. "It's a very unusual exhibit exploring what it was like for those Jews, the first people in the ghetto in Italy."</p><p>Baumgarten noted that the word "ghetto" actually originated in Venice in the 16th century. "The ghetto was the name of the place where they threw junk from foundries-it was basically a garbage dump-so they put the Jews in it," he said.</p><p>"What I tried to do-with both the Venice Institute and the San Francisco exhibit-is to create portals into history and culture," Baumgarten added. "The portals are there to allow people to experience in some way, the daily life of a people who were controlled and defined by other people who considered them as aliens--literally not quite human."</p><p>The exhibit includes unique artifacts as well as images from more than 40 sources in Italy, Israel, and throughout the United States, including the Archivio di Stato of Venice, the Museo de Roma, and the Galleria degli Uffizi of Florence. It also features ceramics that illustrate Jewish Italian life on loan from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.</p><p>In tandem with the exhibit, Baumgarten is also coordinating a symposium featuring an international lineup of scholars in Italian Jewish history and culture, January 24-26, in both San Francisco and at UC Santa Cruz. The event begins in San Francisco on Saturday evening with an opening concert of Baroque music at the Museo ItaloAmericano, followed by the Sunday symposium at the museum from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. </p><p>Baumgarten will moderate the final day of the symposium at UC Santa Cruz on Jan. 26, from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The UCSC event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Baumgarten speculated that the exhibit might travel to Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York after it closes on February 15. But he insisted that it run in San Francisco until at least February. </p><p>"I'm teaching an undergraduate class at UC Santa Cruz this winter quarter titled "Jewish Writers and the European City-Venice,"  Baumgarten noted. "So I made sure that the exhibit ran through February so my students could go!" </p><p>For more information about the exhibit and symposium, contact Professor Baumgarten at (831) 459-1225.

I want to take a moment to reflect on some of the opportunities and challenges awaiting us in coming weeks and months.</p><p>First, on this momentous day, I want to make special note of the engagement of our students in the political process. Many were involved in voter registration drives and campaigning, and many others had the opportunity to cast their first ballots in this historic election.</p><p>I also want to acknowledge how our students, staff, and faculty invested time, personal resources and boundless energy in making the holidays brighter for thousands in our community. Altogether, our campus community contributed more than 57,000 pounds of food and cash equivalent to the annual Second Harvest Food Bank, more than twice last year's total. Our Student Volunteer Center collected, organized, and delivered more than 200 holiday gifts to local children from economically disadvantaged families.</p><p>These extraordinary collaborative efforts, and your many individual acts of grace and generosity that often go unacknowledged, affirm UCSC's enduring relationship with the Santa Cruz community. I want to express my gratitude to you all for strengthening those bonds.</p><p>UCSC's talented faculty continues to garner well-deserved recognition. In the past month, three UCSC professors - Phillip Crews, Darrell Long, and Pradip Mascharak - were elected by their peers to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Math professor Alexander Gamburd won a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers - the highest honor a young scientist or engineer can receive in the United States.</p><p>These accomplishments are further evidence of the character of our students, respect for our faculty and the uncommon quality of their teaching and research, and deepening relationships between our campus and local community.</p><p>Maintaining our momentum in these challenging economic times will require our collective intellectual and entrepreneurial efforts. In a time of dwindling public support, we need to direct available resources - including our talented faculty and academic and administrative staffs - to initiatives that can have the greatest local and global impact.</p><p>EVC Dave Kliger, our academic deans, and principal officers continue to work proactively and strategically to identify how limited resources can best advance our core mission. As that process and state budget discussions continue, we will keep you informed of what we know as we know it - including implications of anticipated mid-year budget cuts.</p><p>I want to close by highlighting three upcoming events that celebrate the mission and promise of UCSC. Our annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner, on Saturday, January 31, will honor Chancellor Emeritus Karl Pister and his wife Rita Olsen Pister for their extraordinary leadership in increasing support for student scholarships. I'm delighted to note the dinner has sold out. Proceeds will fund scholarships for deserving UCSC students. Information is available at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/sbd/">http://www.ucsc.edu/sbd/</a>.</p><p>On February 10, Professor Patricia Zavella will deliver the distinguished Faculty Research Lecture at 8 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall.</p><p>Two days later, on February 12, UCSC will host the 25th Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. We're privileged and excited this year to welcome Van Jones, the noted sustainability and social justice advocate and author of "The Green Collar Economy," as keynote speaker. You can learn more at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/mlk/">http://www.ucsc.edu/mlk/</a>. (Jones, by the way, is the subject of a profile in the January 12 issue of The New Yorker.)</p><p>I look forward to seeing you at one or all of these events, or around campus. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915975818072704601a012ff403fa6e0"><name>2686</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prop. 8 transformed the film Milk, writes film scholar B.

I am writing to ask those who plan to participate in these events­whether in support or in protest­to do so with respect, compassion, and civility.</p><p>.  It is important to remember that UCSC is a community intent on promoting the expression of different viewpoints and perspectives for the purpose of education.</p><p>.  We have an opportunity to model how those in conflict can dialogue in a way that promotes dignity, intellect, compassion, and understanding.</p><p>.  I encourage each of you to keep yourselves informed.</p><p>There are also a number of points from the Principles of Community and the Student Policies and Regulations Handbook's rules on speakers and public events which may be helpful:</p><p>. UCSC is a community that is "committed to promoting and protecting an environment that values and supports every person in an atmosphere of civility, honesty, cooperation, professionalism and fairness." (Principles of Community)</p><p>.  "We believe the free exchange of ideas requires mutual respect and consideration for our differences." (Principles of Community)</p><p>.  At university events, a speaker is accorded the right to express her or his views, even if members of the audience disagree with the speaker or find the views offensive. (Handbook, Section 30.0)</p><p>.  Individuals and groups who disagree with the speaker may register their opposition but in no case may there be physical violence or threats of force, violence, or intimidation. (Handbook, Appendix I)</p><p>.  The rights of the dissenter(s) should be respected, as much as the rights of the speaker. However the speaker is entitled to communicate her or his message to the audience during her or his allotted time, and the audience is entitled to hear the message and see the speaker during that time. (Handbook, Appendix I)</p><p>.  The content of the speech, even parts deemed defamatory or insulting, does not entitle any member of the audience to engage in disruption, force, or violence.  (Handbook, Appendix I)</p><p>.  Insults of a hate or biased nature are not valid grounds for disruption or physical attack, particularly from a voluntary audience that was invited but in no way compelled to be present.

<p>With 52 alumni serving as Peace Corps Volunteers, Santa Cruz ranks second among all medium-size universities for the number of alumni currently in service (UCSC would rank 16th among all schools of all sizes). The university ranked sixth last year with 50 alumni serving.</p>
<p>The annual Peace Corps Top Colleges list is a friendly competition among many schools with a strong legacy of service. This year's top-ranked schools (in the three size categories) are the University of Washington, George Washington University, and the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>"The Peace Corps relies heavily on the graduates of contributing schools from across the country. Their education and experiences add to the diversity of the Peace Corps and its success in the host countries," said outgoing Peace Corps Director Ronald A. Tschetter. "We want to thank the schools and the graduates for their continued dedication to the mission of the Peace Corps."</p>
<p>Peace Corps saw a 16 percent increase in applications in fiscal year 2008-the largest increase in five years.</p>
<p>Currently, 7,876 Peace Corps Volunteers serve in 76 countries. Rwanda becomes the 76th country next week, when the Peace Corps returns after a 15-year absence.</p>
<p>The Peace Corps is preparing celebrations for its 50th Anniversary in 2011. All-time, 665 UC Santa Cruz alumni have served in the Peace Corps. More than 195,000 Americans have served in 139 countries.</p>

"In many traditional systems, food is an important and accessible primary form of treatment."</p><p>Cultural knowledge about the healing nature of foods that has been passed down through generations must be reclaimed, and Chen's hope is that readers will come to think about nutrition as an organic form of cultural knowledge, rather than solely a scientific undertaking.</p><p>"If one is aware of dietary therapy, it's possible to practice it on an everyday basis, and not wait until one gets ill," said Chen. "Our health care system is in crisis, chronic disease is at an all-time high, and obesity is a top health concern. When diet is a primary element of wellness, it's not all up to the experts. We should consider health as an issue of justice and equality."</p><p>In <i>Food, Medicine, and the Quest for Good Health</i>, Chen draws on medical texts and food therapy practices from around the world and throughout history to identify intersections between food and medicine. Some of those crossovers have had global consequences. For example, salt, sugar, and spices have been valued for their healing properties, and trade of these commodities transformed tastes, food practices, and the political economy of Europe, Asia, and the New World.</p><p>Diets vary across cultures, of course, as do notions of what to eat on a daily basis and what to consume during illness. But Chen says the idea of balance runs across many cultures. "Illness is defined across many cultures as a need to return to balance," she said.</p><p>Chen, who is Chinese American, says rice porridge and tea are staples of a traditional Chinese diet, and she notes that many cultures feature a simple, hearty mush-type meal of rice, wheat, or another grain. "It provides good sustenance at a basic level and alleviates richer foods," she said.</p><p>The industrialized food wave that swept across the United States is now moving globally, spreading highly processed foods around the world, observes Chen, whose book includes a chapter on centenarians. From the Hunza Valley of northern Pakistan to Ecuador, centenarians subsist on simple diets of local foods and share a high level of physical activity and hard work, said Chen.</p><p>"Although we in the West are constantly searching for the diet du jour, it hasn't solved the problem of nutritional illiteracy," said Chen. "We're seeing chronic disease that is avoidable on a scale that has never been matched before."</p><p>Chen salutes the impact of food scholars who have popularized ideas about "localism" and "food miles," and she notes the growing democratization of the food system.</p><p>"As an anthropologist, I tend to be very pragmatic," said Chen. " 'Locavores' are calling for the transformation of global patterns of food production and consumption. My hope is that we don't leave it up to institutions like the Food and Drug Administration or agribusiness, and that consumers have a voice in that transformation, which I believe is happening. Localism started to become popular about five years ago, and now more people are engaged with enacting these values. It's a good example of how change can happen."</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Nancy Chen can be reached via e-mail sent to nchen@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91597ce68072704601a012ff99deaac4"><name>2691</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>For second consecutive year, undergraduate applications to UC Santa Cruz exceed 30,000</title><summary>For the second year in a row, more than 30,000 prospective undergraduates have applied to the University of California, Santa Cruz for admission in the upcoming fall quarter.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831) 459-2495</author><description>For the second year in a row, more than 30,000 prospective undergraduates have applied to the University of California, Santa Cruz for admission in the upcoming fall quarter.</description><start-date>1232694000000</start-date><display-name>For second consecutive year,...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2691</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2691</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338815153</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338815153</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For the second year in a row, more than 30,000 prospective undergraduates have applied to the University of California, Santa Cruz for admission in the upcoming fall quarter. Numbers released today by UC's Office of the President showed that UC Santa Cruz attracted 32,847 applications from high school seniors and transfer students during the university's "priority filing" period of November 1-30.</p>

"The interest we received from prospective undergraduates for next fall is on par with the very high threshold we established a year ago," said Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management. "Having sustained that level of interest is very gratifying - and testimony to the high quality of UCSC's people and programs."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Two years ago, UCSC received 29,140 applications from prospective undergraduates (freshmen and transfer students). Last year, that number jumped 13.4 percent to 33,055. For fall '09, undergraduate applications totaled 32,847 - 208 (approximately 0.6 percent) fewer than undergraduate applications received a year ago.</p>
<p>Whittingham said UCSC officials are particularly pleased that applications from prospective transfer students continued to climb this year. UCSC received 5,616 such applications, 371 (7.1 percent) more than a year earlier. "Given the UC Regents' recent decision regarding the budget's impact on UC-wide enrollment, that is where undergraduate growth on our campus will occur this fall," she said.</p>
<p>One of the six UC campuses with reduced enrollment targets for freshmen, UCSC has a fall '09 enrollment target of no more than 3,620 freshmen; that is a reduction of 335 from this past fall. However, the Regents are encouraging growth in transfer-student enrollment, and UCSC's fall '09 enrollment target will be no more than 950 such students, 80 more than the campus enrolled this past fall.</p>
<p>Applications from prospective freshmen were similar to last year's numbers in all five of UCSC's academic divisions: Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences. Slight increases were experienced in the Baskin School of Engineering and in Physical and Biological Sciences. Approximately one-third of the prospective freshmen applied to UCSC with an undeclared major.</p>
<p>"Since our freshman enrollment target is lower than it was for this past fall, the fact that we received more than 27,000 applications from that group will make freshman admission for fall 2009 more competitive than ever," Whittingham said.</p>
<p>Among California freshman applications to UCSC, increases were realized in all of the underrepresented ethnic groups: African American, from 972 last year to 986 this year, a 1.4 percent increase; American Indian, from 180 last year to 207 this year, a 15.0 percent increase; and Chicano/Latino, from 5,105 last year to 5,366 this year, a 5.1 percent increase.</p>
<p>In transfer-student applications from California's Community Colleges, the increases from underrepresented groups were even larger: African American, from 127 last year to 166 this year, a 30.7 percent increase; American Indian, from 49 last year to 59 this year, a 20.4 percent increase; and Chicano/Latino, from 774 last year to 851 this year, a 9.9 percent increase.</p>
<p>"We are very excited about these increases, especially among transfer students coming from the state's community colleges," Whittingham said. "It's important that the ethnic diversity of UCSC's students more closely mirror the state we serve."</p>
<p>Undergraduate applicants to UCSC will be notified of admission decisions beginning on March 15. Admitted freshmen will have until May 1 to file a "statement of intent to register," indicating their intention to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. The deadline for transfer students is June 1.</p>

<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Barnes is best known to television audiences for her five-year run as Anne Marie on ABC's <em>Roseanne</em>.</p>
<p>She has also appeared on a variety of other TV programs, including <em>Cold Case, Gilmore Girls, Roswell, Family Law, Suddenly Susan</em>, and <em>Mad About You</em>.</p>
<p>Barnes's film credits include <em>Murder By Numbers</em> with Sandra Bullock and <em>Erin Brockovich</em> with Julia Roberts. She also played opposite Hillary Swank in the HBO film, <em>Iron Jawed Angels</em>.</p>
<p>In her one-woman play, <em>I Am That I Am: Woman, Black</em>, Barnes will take a historical journey through the lives of seven renowned women: Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Mary McLeod Bethune, Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Angela Davis, and Maya Angelou.</p>
<p>Her portrayal of these seven exceptional women takes the audience through time-from the days of slavery to the present. Barnes has toured the show across the United States, Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean for more than a decade.</p>

On January 20, he was among the throngs who witnessed the inauguration of President Barack Obama. The next day, he sent this letter to friends and colleagues.</i></p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>It was an icy cold and windy day. We had to stand in line for hours, increasingly squished together at what crowd control experts call "choke points." At first we all had a patch of ground, but by the time we reached the one open gate at least three strangers' bodies were pressing against each of ours at all times. Even though we were among the lucky ones who had tickets to stand in front of the Capitol steps, we still couldn't see anything. After standing for hours in bone-chilling weather, my toes felt so numb I worried about frostbite. How can I sum up my Inaugural experience? Indescribably fabulous. </p><p>I was only 15 and too young to know enough to go to the Civil Rights Movement's great March on Washington in 1963, but I've always been moved beyond words by the news footage of 250,000 people on the National Mall from every state--more than had ever marched there in the history of the United States. They heard Martin Luther King's luminous "I Have a Dream" speech. Yesterday, six times that many people gathered in that same space to witness his dream take another giant step toward coming true, and at the same time ending an eight-year national nightmare.   </p><p>We pushed through the mammoth crowd along the metal barriers past the long row of port-a-potties and gazed out from the Capitol steps over the Mall, back past Washington Monument a mile and a half to the Lincoln Memorial. A virtual sea of humanity seemed to stretch to the horizon, all cheering, their joy visible in the white puffs of frozen breath, which just took mine away.  </p><p>Especially the morning after Martin Luther King's birthday. Especially seeing Obama take the oath on Lincoln's Bible. Especially standing on the great stone stairs of a Capitol building built by slaves. The whole scene made me weep, like many others around me.</p><p>Later we went to the Western States Inaugural Ball, one of ten or more balls held across the city. Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez sang salsa songs. The Bidens came for a few minutes. The vice president quoted a line from a Seamus Heany poem about making history.  </p><p>Half an hour later, as we were starting to leave, away from the spotlights at one end of the huge hall, a Marine band quietly began to assemble. The crowd migrated toward it. The first bar of "Hail to the Chief" brought a roar.  After a few seconds, a beaming Barack and Michelle Obama walked out to an ovation. When the cheering finally subsided, the president thanked us and asked us to begin--tomorrow morning--the work of remaking America. The First Couple then slow-danced alone across the stage, rather romantically, much to the crowd's delight, before waving goodbye.</p><p>Later, on our way home, exhausted, our car was inexplicably blocked at an intersection in a poor, mostly black, neighborhood by a motorcycle cop and instructed not to move. A long two minutes went by. Then we saw a helicopter low overhead, its huge searchlight scanning rooftops. Suddenly a dozen motorcycle cops zoomed past, red and blue lights flashing, followed by several police cars, then two huge black Chevy SUV's with darkly tinted windows, followed by the limousines. The Obamas put in an appearance at all ten Inaugural Balls (none paid for by corporate money), but they ended after midnight at The Neighborhood Ball, the one for all the people who couldn't get in to any of the other balls.  </p><p>You all were way warmer and had a much better view on TV, but was I happy to be here? Mere words fail.</p><p>Craig </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915981118072704601a012ff94077e52"><name>2694</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; published a review of a new book by professor of history and literature Nathaniel Deutsch.</summary><description>The &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; published a review of a new book by professor of history and literature Nathaniel Deutsch.</description><start-date>1232694000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2694</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2694</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338816212</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338816212</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <em><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></em> published a review of a new book by professor of history and literature Nathaniel Deutsch titled <em>Inventing America's 'Worst' Family.</em></p>

"I went down with a couple of friends...the whole idea was to ride the train after I researched the shelters and the prisons." </p><p>"In hindsight, it probably wasn't the smartest decision," Fukunaga added. "Within three hours, in the middle of nowhere, there was a bandit attack and a guy got shot and thrown off the train. </p><p>"But I think it was on that train ride that I really decided that I could tell this story. before that, I felt like it wasn't my experience, so how can I tell this?" </p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915986e88072704601a012ff515dc0be"><name>2698</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reported Cases of Gastroenteritis ("stomach flu") Virus and Precautions</title><start-date>1232175600000</start-date><display-name>Reported Cases of Gastroenteritis...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2698</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2698</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338817679</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338817679</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write out of concern for your well being and to advise you that there have been several cases of gastroenteritis ("stomach flu") illness reported on campus during this past week.  I hope to enlist your assistance in following good hygiene strategies aimed at minimizing any possible spread of this illness. Per instructions from Environmental Health and Safety officials, I am also asking those who experience any symptoms to report this to the Campus Health Center, and to fill out the County Health Department Survey (see link below).</p><p>The cause is not completely known at this time.  Health Center Staff and campus Environmental Health and Safety officials are implementing the standard protocols and working with the County Health Department to identify any possible common cause.</p><p>The symptoms of illness usually include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping.  Sometimes people have a low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a general sense of tiredness.  The illness often begins suddenly, and the infected person may feel very sick. The illness is usually brief, with symptoms lasting only about 1 or 2 days.  Viruses can live outside of the body and can be passed by touching objects/surfaces/utensils that have been infected by someone who was ill. Such viruses are not life threatening, but can cause significant gastrointestinal issues (vomiting and diarrhea) and dehydration if the person is unable to drink enough liquids to replace liquids lost.</p><p>For the duration of the holiday weekend, students needing medical assistance should go to the urgent care facility at the corner of Mission and Laurel, or to the Emergency Room at Dominican Hospital. </p><p>Out of concern for our entire community, it is critical that all of us be persistent with washing hands with soap frequently throughout the day and especially after being in the bathroom.  It is also wise to refrain from sharing food and beverage containers with another person. In addition, when eating in the campus Dining Halls, be sure to wash your hands prior to entering the dining hall, use the tongs and scoops when getting food from the self-service areas, and do not touch food directly.</p><p>Other general tips on maintaining health and stopping the spread of germs, may be found at the following link to the Centers for Disease Control: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/germstopper/home_work_school.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/germstopper/home_work_school.htm</a></p><p>It is also important that the campus be informed of any students who may become ill. On-campus students are urged to report any illness of this type to a member of the residence life staff (RA or CRE).

M. Keck Foundation to establish the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics. A joint endeavor of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering and the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC, the center explores the integration of nanotechnology and optofluidic silicon chips and how this technology can be used to improve biomedical analysis in a wide range of fields, including toxicology, immunology, disease detection, and diagnostics.</p><p>"Being able to analyze single biomolecules is essential to improving our fundamental understanding of life and to developing a new generation of ultrasensitive instruments to detect diseases," said Holger Schmidt, associate professor of electrical engineering and director of the center. "We have developed an optofluidic platform that enables us to detect single molecules and particles on a chip without the need for bulky microscopes. The Keck Foundation grant provides the financial resource to establish the nanofabrication capabilities required to define nanoscale features on optofluidic chips and take this platform to a new level. We can now conduct benchmark studies in molecular biology to verify the potential of this approach."</p><p>The interdisciplinary team led by Schmidt is composed of faculty from five UCSC departments: Mark Akeson, professor of biomolecular engineering; David Deamer, professor emeritus of biomolecular engineering; William Dunbar, assistant professor of computer engineering; Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology; and Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. The center grew out of earlier collaborations between these investigators funded in part by a Keck Futures Nanotechnology Grant Schmidt received in 2005.</p><p>"The W. M. Keck Foundation's commitment to high-risk research, especially in these economic times, is remarkable," said Michael Isaacson, acting dean of Baskin Engineering and Narinder Singh Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics. "Dr. Schmidt and the team clearly have demonstrated the tremendous potential for developing instrumentation that is portable, inexpensive, and fast. We are grateful that the foundation recognizes this potential."</p><p>Based in Los Angeles, the <a href="http://www.wmkeck.org/">W. M. Keck Foundation</a> was established in 1954 by the late W. M. Keck, founder of the Superior Oil Company. The foundation's grant making is focused primarily on pioneering efforts in the areas of medical research, science, and engineering. The foundation also maintains a program to support undergraduate science and humanities education and a Southern California Grant Program that provides support in the areas of health care, civic and community services, education, and the arts, with a special emphasis on children and youth. </p><p>UCSC's <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/home">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a> prepares technologists--and sponsors technology--for our changing world. Founded in 1997, Baskin Engineering trains students in six future-focused areas of engineering: biotechnology/information technology/ nanotechnology; bioengineering; information and communication infrastructure; mathematical and statistical modeling; software and services engineering; and system design. Baskin Engineering faculty conduct industry-leading research that is improving the way the world does business, treats the environment, and nurtures humanity.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91598ad88072704601a012ffbcb6be78"><name>2700</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's housing practices lauded with cover story</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is featured on the cover of the January/February issue of &lt;i&gt;Talking Stick&lt;/i&gt;; the cover article is on housing assignment best practices.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><keywords>best housing practices, best college housing practices, UCSC housing, UC Santa Cruz housing, UC Santa Cruz housing honored, Talking Stick</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz is featured on the cover of the January/February issue of &lt;i&gt;Talking Stick&lt;/i&gt;; the cover article is on housing assignment best practices.</description><start-date>1233039600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC's housing practices lauded...</display-name><path>/2009/01/2700</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/01/2700</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338818723</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338818723</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/01/images/talking_stick.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/01/images/talking_stick.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>talking_stick.jpg</name><file-size>72805</file-size><width>300</width><height>360</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is featured on the cover of this month's issue of <i>Talking Stick,</i> the magazine of the Association of College and University Housing Officers-International (ACUHO-I).

The observations enabled astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to generate realistic images of the planet by feeding the data into computer simulations of the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>"We can't get a direct image of the planet, but we can deduce what it would look like if you were there. The ability to go beyond an artist's interpretation and do realistic simulations of what you would actually see is very exciting," said Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. Laughlin is lead author of a new report on the findings published this week in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope to obtain infrared measurements of the heat emanating from the planet as it whipped behind and close to its star. In just six hours, the planet's temperature rose from 800 to 1,500 Kelvin (980 to 2,240 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Known as HD 80606b, the planet circles a star 200 light years from Earth, is four times the mass of Jupiter, and has the most eccentric orbit of any known planet. It spends most of its 111.4-day orbit at distances that would place it between Venus and Earth in our own solar system, while the closest part of its orbit brings it within 0.03 astronomical units of its star (one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the Sun). The planet zips through this dramatic close encounter with its star in less than a day.</p>
<p>At the closest point, the sunlight beating down on the planet is 825 times stronger than the irradiation it receives at its farthest point from the star. "If you could float above the clouds of this planet, you'd see its sun growing larger and larger at faster and faster rates, increasing in brightness by almost a factor of 1,000," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Spitzer observed the planet for 30 hours before, during, and just after its closest approach to the star. The planet passed behind the star (an event called a secondary eclipse) just before the moment of its closest approach. This was a lucky break for Laughlin and his colleagues, who had not known that would happen when they planned the observation. The secondary eclipse allowed them to get accurate measurements from just the star and thereby determine exact temperatures for the planet.</p>
<p>The extreme temperature swing observed by Spitzer indicates that the intense irradiation from the star is absorbed in a layer of the planet's upper atmosphere that absorbs and loses heat rapidly, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Jonathan Langton, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC, fed the Spitzer data into a hydrodynamic model of the planet's atmosphere to predict its response to the intense heating. Langton's simulation shows the global storms and shockwaves unleashed in the planet's atmosphere every 111 days as it swings close to its star.</p>
<p>"The initial response could be described as an explosion on the side facing the star," Langton said. "As the atmosphere heats up and expands, it produces very high winds, on the order of 5 kilometers per second, flowing away from the day side toward the night side. The rotation of the planet causes these winds to curl up into large-scale storm systems that gradually die down as the planet cools over the course of its orbit."</p>
<p>Daniel Kasen, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at UCSC, was able to generate photorealistic images of the planet using a program he developed to calculate radiative transfer processes in astrophysics. "It calculates the color and intensity of light coming from the glowing planet, and also how starlight would reflect off the surface of the planet," Kasen said.</p>
<p>The resulting images show a thin blue crescent of reflected starlight framing the night side of the planet, which glows cherry red from its own heat, like coals in a fire. "These images are far more realistic than anything that's been done before for extrasolar planets," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>If the planet's orbit is aligned just right, it will pass in front of the star (an event known as a primary transit) on February 14. Both professional and amateur astronomers worldwide will be watching to see if this happens. The occurrence of primary transits would enable astronomers to learn more about this unusual planet by conducting spectroscopic observations.</p>
<p>HD 80606b was originally discovered in 2001 by a Swiss planet-hunting team led by Dominique Naef of the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland. Using a method known as the Doppler-velocity technique, they detected the tell-tale wobble in the light from the star caused by the gravitational tug of the planet.</p>
<p>Subsequent observations by Laughlin's colleagues on the <a href="http://exoplanets.org">California &amp; Carnegie Planet Search</a> team--Steve Vogt at UCSC and Paul Butler at the Carnegie Institute of Washington--provided precise information about the planet's orbit, which was essential for planning the Spitzer observations. Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center contributed his expertise to the analysis of the Spitzer data. Other coauthors of the <em>Nature</em> paper include UCSC postdoctoral researcher Eugenio Rivera and graduate student Stefano Meschiari.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), under contract to NASA. Support for this work was provided by NASA through an award issued by JPL/Caltech.</p>

Become a Facebook friend of Stelephant Colbert.</p>
<p>Stelephant and his prime-time rival, Jon Sealwart, are a couple of funny guys who are showing off for the ladies, trading barbs, and mugging for the camera.</p>
<p>But we're not talking fake news here. Stelephant and Jon are elephant seals who've hauled their blubbery masses onto the sand for the elephant seal love-in and birth-fest that happens every year at AÃ±o Nuevo State Natural Reserve, about 21 miles north of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>And we landlubbers can follow their antics, travels, adventures, and (oh my) love affairs by reading blogs written by researchers at UC Santa Cruz who are studying the animals and making progress in the quest to understand their behavior, migration, physiology, and more.</p>
<p>"As a patriotic Pinniped-American, it is my sworn duty to consume as much as possible whenever possible, and to horde women like real estate to broadcast my social status as brilliant and clear as the chrome on Kanye's rims," blusters Stelephant's <a href="http://topp.org/blog/stelephant_colbert_baaaaaaack">blog</a> in a dead-on impression of the human Colbert, replete with Jon Sealwart put-downs.</p>
<p>"Stelephant is getting 15 friends a day at least," said Nicole Teutschel, a graduate student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at UCSC who also coordinates education and outreach for social media for the seal component of Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP). As of Thursday, Stelephant had 262 friends.</p>
<p>Naming two seals after fake-news-show titans Stephen Colbert of the <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/home">Colbert Report</a> and Jon Stewart of the <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">Daily Show</a> was, Teutschel admits, a naked (and big, floppy-nosed) attempt to appeal to Colbert's obsession with being "name-afterable" and perhaps get mentioned on those shows, much the way Stephanie Colburtle the Turtle was in 2007.</p>
<p>Stephanie Colburtle is described on Colbert's Wikipedia spoof Wikiality as "Stephen's beautiful adopted sea turtle daughter." The student researchers at Drexel University in Philadelphia named Stephanie after Colbert as part of their research into tracking turtle migrations to the Galapagos Islands. She participated the Great Turtle Race, which Colbert featured on his show.</p>
<p>However, Stelephant and Jon aren't the only AÃ±o Nuevo seals who got names this year. There are also males Monty, Nat, and Sebastian, and females Josephine, Sunny, Bottleneck, Featherfoot, Sandie, Ellie, Poppy, Callie, Sidda, and Spot.</p>
<p>Many of those names came from students who are following the seals at Valencia Elementary School in Aptos and Hillbrook Elementary School in Los Gatos.</p>
<p>These seals are also befriendable--and make for great reading--on Facebook (or, for the Facebook-phobic, you can also find their blogs and track their progress on the <a href="http://www.topp.org">TOPP website</a>). Their blogs are, however, much tamer than those of the in-your-face Stelephant Colbert and Jon Sealwart. With a little fancy first-person writing and some help from Photoshop, the TOPP team has had a good time impersonating (im-seal-ating?) the real Colbert and Stewart.</p>
<p>The other seals' blogs are from the researchers' point of view and focus on such topics as tag removal and pup births. They're also packed with photos of big fat seals and adorable seal pups lounging on the beach.</p>
<p>However, even Stelephant's and Jon's blogs will soon introduce more scientific topics such as alpha males and reproduction, said Teutschel.</p>
<p>This is the second year TOPP has named seals. Naming the seals and tracking them through blogs is part of <a href="http://www.topp.org/elephant_seal_homecoming_days_2009">Elephant Seal Homecoming Days</a>, a program sponsored by TOPP and California State Parks. Several thousand elephant seals return each winter from the far reaches of the North Pacific Ocean to molt, mate, and give birth to their pups on the beaches of AÃ±o Nuevo. To celebrate the migration, TOPP wanted to invite the community to witness and learn about the seals' annual journey.</p>
<p>The tracking of these seals began when researchers from ecology and evolutionary biology professor Dan Costa's lab at Long Marine Lab attached high-tech satellite tags to 30 elephant seals last summer.</p>
<p>The tags allow researchers to learn about marine science, as well as elephant seal physiology, migration, behavior, and more. For eight months, the seals lived and foraged along the rich edges of the massive eddies that swirl across the North Pacific, swimming constantly and diving repeatedly to depths of 600-1,000 meters or more. Then they made a U-turn and traveled thousands of miles back to their harems.</p>
<p>Researchers assigned names to 15 of the seals and have followed them back to shore through blogs about their arrival, their pups' birth, tag removal, and other tidbits.</p>
<p>Naming the seals helps people connect to individual animals, said Costa.</p>
<p>"We don't relate well to populations and abstract concepts," Costa said. "People can relate to a pet with a name but don't have the same interaction with animals at large. So naming them makes it more personal and allows people to identify with them."</p>
<p>Costa sees Seal Homecoming Days and Facebook pages as "our opportunity to educate the public on what we do and why it's relevant and important," he said. "It's also important for researchers to be accountable to the public, so that the public appreciates what we do and why. Also, we are a university, and a major role of what we do is education, so this is an extension of that responsibility."</p>
<p>The seals are pretty impressive sitting on the beach--but that's just a small part of their story, said Costa.</p>
<p>"The bigger story is what they do when they're not on the beach, which is most of the year," he said. "They dive to incredible depths and go halfway across the Pacific and back."</p>
<p>This research is certainly fascinating and important. But what if Stephen Colbert were to find out about his namesake elephant seal and give Costa a call?</p>
<p>"I'm a big fan!" said Costa. "I would love to just have a discussion with him and tell him about these amazing animals. Ultimately, the more we appreciate them, the more we will want to protect them and their marine environment."</p>
