In particular, I am intrigued by the paradox of being engaged with students as a teaching assistant and with my professors as a graduate student. I get to practice and share what I have learned with fellow undergraduates. It's a great feeling when you get to share your knowledge and enthusiasm with someone.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>My office, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It is truly soothing and comforting as I grade away papers in my office space. A place of personal serenity, you might say.</p><p><b>How has your UCSC graduate education shaped you professionally? </b></p><p>With the support from the DANM program, I participated in several international art symposia and biennials such as ISEA (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts) '09 in Singapore and Gwangju Biennale in South Korea. I am now established as a practicing artist and curator from Malaysia, thanks to my professors.</p><p><b>What are your plans after graduation? </b></p><p>I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in visual culture, focusing on curatorial/knowledge at GoldSmith, University of London, this coming September. I think it's a great transition from UCSC.</p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>I received several grants from UCSC, such as Regent Fellowship Grant, Porter Fellow-- Graduate Arts Research Grant, and DANM Fund for Excellence. I won second place for the ASEAN New Media competition in Indonesia and curated several national and international exhibitions as a graduate student.</p><p>My dissertation examines the formal environment of an exhibition space. Precisely, it explores "subjectivity" in exhibition-making by exploring traditional ontology where division between subjective and objective is literally unthinkable. The research proceeds from the premise that subjectivity in an exhibition space is essentially hinged upon the legitimization process created by the museum and traditional art world originating from the cultural history of the West.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ae81f8072704601a012ff8620113d"><name>2915</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-makes-us-human"&gt;cover story&lt;/a&gt; of the May issue of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; focuses on research conducted in David Haussler's lab.</summary><description>The &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-makes-us-human"&gt;cover story&lt;/a&gt; of the May issue of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; focuses on research conducted in David Haussler's lab.</description><start-date>1241420400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2915</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2915</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338908110</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338908110</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/sci_am_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/sci_am_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sci_am_200.jpg</name><file-size>62029</file-size><width>200</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The cover story of the May issue of <strong><em>Scientific American</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-makes-us-human">"What Makes Us Human?,"</a> focuses on research conducted in biomolecular engineer David Haussler's lab.

</p><p><b>Age:</b> 23 </p><p><b>Major:</b> Theater arts </p><p><b>Hometown:</b>  Arcadia, CA </p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Kresge </p><p> </p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why? </b></p><p>Ted Warburton's <i>Dance Improvisation</i> was one of the first dance classes I decided to take at UCSC. It introduced dance concepts and technique in an extremely personal and active way, giving a specific responsibility to the creative choices made while providing for freedom of movement and expression. Ted Warburton is a phenomenal professor and facilitator of dance and theory, and this course has served as a cornerstone in my understanding of the creative process and improvisation. This is only one of many favorite classes and teachers that have been hugely inspirational. </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>Through Tandy Beal's <i>Dance Around the World</i> and art education class, I was given the opportunity to translate English to Spanish for the mayor of Santa Cruz as she spoke to the families of 200 third graders and all in attendance, declaring February 28 "Dance Around the World Day" in Santa Cruz.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>Nothing compares to flying over the second hump on the center bike path coming down the hill from the Music Center on a late spring day, taking in the sunset and 180-degree view of the water, then dropping in to patches of cool air as you pass the Farm to the right. </p><p> </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>UCSC has provided me with the opportunity to experiment, define, challenge, and understand how I interact with myself and with my surroundings. Certainly I have grown through helping lead backpacking trips through the Sierras with the Recreation Department's Wilderness Orientation and facilitating proper hygiene in the wilderness through instructional skits. Also performing since freshman year with Someone Always Dies and learning that fasting the day of a show out of nervousness was not the most effective approach to successful improv. UCSC also happened to provide me with a two-year abroad experience in Santiago de Chile, and I cannot quite describe with words the immensity of change and shaping this experience fostered in me.</p><p> </p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>Train in martial arts practices in Southwest India. Perform throughout Latin America while trying to get rid of my gringo accent. Find more opportunities for bilingual dance theater performance in Europe and the Middle East. Further incorporate education into my vision as a performance artist, pushing myself to be challenged equally as a teacher and performer. Get a call in to my mom at least every other week to let her know what's up.</p><p> </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>I initially chose College Ten for its commitment to social justice and community but decided to transfer affiliation to Kresge after the first quarter of freshman year, finding it a better fit with proximity to theater arts and K-town kids.

I remember coming to class prepared by doing all the reading because I was super interested in the subject. I always left the class a little depressed but anxious to go out and effect change in some way.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b>  </p><p>My most memorable experience at UCSC has to be during the Multicultural Celebration. I invited my mom and brother for the weekend and we just enjoyed the free music and dance performances and the food and jammed out with all my friends.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>I like the area by the media theater where you come over the ridge out of the forest and look out to the ocean. I love this spot because it makes me feel happy to be where I am and relaxed and calm, ready for class or my day.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>UCSC has really made me not just accept but embrace my identity and my role in this world. I have grown and developed a secure sense of myself. I am more aware of the struggles my community and other people of color face and am devoted to making an impactful change.</p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>I have studied environmental studies and economics at UCSC with the goal of working for the National Park Service so that I can help protect the place where I am from, Yosemite, while also helping my people, the Southern Sierra Miwuk tribe, gain federal recognition.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>I chose College Eight because it was the environmental college and it had a nice view, but they put me in Merrill instead, which really does fit me because it's the college that fits with my interests of global consciousness and identity. I've met many amazing, beautiful people on the top of that hill. Merrill also made me feel comfortable surrounded by other people of color. I wouldn't say my entire two years in the dorms was amazing but being both a freshman and later an R.A. made me focus and strive to be a friend and ally.</p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>I think most of what I have accomplished here has been in representing my Native American ancestry by being involved and active with SANAI (Student Alliance of North American Indians), TWANAS (Third World and Native American Students Press Collective), and with the resource centers. Attending and directing money toward different student organization events through the Cultural Events Planning Committee is another skill and accomplishment I'm proud of. I have also managed to graduate in four years, the first of my family, and study abroad in New Zealand for an entire year, which was a year of learning and travel.</p><p>There aren't many Native students at UCSC, and the recent state budget cuts are really affecting my community. Our Native American resource director, Dennis Tibbets, retired, and in his place no one is expected to be hired. I hope the greatest acheivement of mine will be in expressing why such a position is needed on this campus and attaining a commitment from the university to hire a director so that students like me are supported and feel comfortable enough to continue their education at UCSC.  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915af45a8072704601a012ff543c4da6"><name>2923</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Farzaneh Tondnevis </title><summary>B.S., biochemistry and molecular biology</summary><keywords>Farzaneh Tondnevis</keywords><description>B.S., biochemistry and molecular biology</description><start-date>1241506800000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2923</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2923</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338911271</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338911271</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/tondnevis.farzaneh.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/tondnevis.farzaneh.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tondnevis.farzaneh.300.jpg</name><file-size>42752</file-size><width>300</width><height>384</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Farzaneh Tondnevis (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Farzaneh Tondnevis       </p><p><b>Age:</b> 25</p><p><b>Majors:</b> Biochemistry and molecular biology</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Tehran, Iran (since living in the U.S., San Jose, CA)</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Eight</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why? </b></p><p><i>Biochemistry 100A</i> and <i>Psychology 1,</i> the former because it was a great introduction to the field taught by an incredible instructor (Professor Harry Noller) and the latter because it gave me more insight about the psyche and mentality of human beings.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>Getting the approval of my principal investigator to do undergraduate research in his phenomenal lab.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>The scenic view on Coolidge Drive, because it has an extraordinary view of the bay and the city and it calms me down and helps me relax.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>My experience at UCSC has helped me grow into a more mature woman, and I have gained a better understanding of the importance of science and the value of scientists' work. Through taking different classes at UCSC from all different fields (major-related and general education classes) I now have a better understanding of the world. Most of all, I have gained a higher level of self confidence, and I know now that I can achieve whatever I aim for through hard work and determination.</p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>Hopefully continue to do research in biochemistry and molecular biology, make fascinating discoveries in the field, and publish in well-known journals.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>I chose College Eight because my junior college professor, who got his Ph.D. from UCSC, advised me to do so, and I personally found the advisers and preceptors very helpful and friendly. I also loved the theme of the college, which is Environment and Society. I believe through talking to advisers at College Eight, I chose the right classes to graduate on time and I met new friends. The memories are going to stay with me forever.</p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p> I am graduating with a B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biology from one of the best universities in the nation. I came to the United States five years ago and started pursuing this degree two weeks after my arrival. I have been doing undergraduate research in the lab of Professor Harry Noller, who is known worldwide for his life-long research on ribosomes. I will submit my thesis on my research before the end of spring quarter.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915af6d28072704601a012ffc5f8df59"><name>2925</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Rigo Dicochea</title><summary>M.S., computer engineering</summary><keywords>Rigo Dicochea</keywords><description>M.S., computer engineering</description><start-date>1241506800000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2925</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2925</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338911879</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338911879</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/dicochea_rigo.320.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/dicochea_rigo.320.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dicochea_rigo.320.jpg</name><file-size>71446</file-size><width>320</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Rigo Dicochea (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Rigo G. Dicochea</p><p><b>Age:</b> 30</p><p><b>Degree:</b> M.S., computer engineering</p><p><b>Field of study:</b> Computer engineering with focus on computer architecture</p><p><b>Faculty adviser:</b> Professor Jose Renau</p><p><b>Undergraduate education:</b> UCSC--B.S., computer engineering 2006</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Watsonville, CA</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why?</b></p><p>My favorite class was <i>Computer Engineering 110,</i> a class taught by Professor Andrea Di Blas. This was the first real introduction I received about computer hardware. This was very valuable in that it contributed immensely to my decision of research in computer architecture. My favorite professor is Jose Renau. I am not just saying that because he is my adviser. He is truly an awesome adviser. He is very patient, answers all my questions, is always available, even at 1 a.m., and I honestly want to work hard on my research because I know he has done so much to get me this far.</p><p> </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b> </p><p>Academia has always been a challenge for me. I always felt I had to work harder than everyone or that I was less intelligent than my peers. I remember a meeting I had with Darrell Long, professor of computer science at UCSC, when we started talking about my personal life and how God had used my diagnosis of cancer to radically change my life. We must have talked for over an hour about how I had grown up less privileged than most of my peers and how growing up in Watsonville had shaped some of my aspirations, for the better or worse. I let him know that education, especially during middle school and high school years was not always my top priority and then he surprised me when he said that someone like me should go to graduate school. Graduate school never entered my mind until he offered to guide me on my journey. It was at that point inside Professor Long's office that I began to realize that a master's degree and now even a Ph.D. were, with hard work and dedication, possible. I will never forget that experience of realizing I could be the first in my family to go on to extreme higher education. </p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>My favorite spot at UCSC is probably the back of Engineering 2. It may sound strange since it is only a parking lot, but there is also a beautiful forest setting where my wife and I sit in our car and have lunch. It is serene and offers a nice break from the stress of graduate studies.</p><p><b>How has your UCSC graduate education shaped you professionally?</b></p><p>The education I have received at UCSC has been invaluable. I have been introduced to faculty and professional engineers who will increase my chances of finding not only a job, but more importantly, finding a job I want to do.  </p><p><b>What are your plans after graduation?</b></p><p>I was accepted to the Ph.D. program here at UCSC two months ago. So, I am eager to begin the next phase of my academic journey into the world of doctorate research.  I am excited and anxious about what is in store.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Rigo received the CLOW Scholarship, a National Science Foundation Scholarship, and an  Adobe Scholarship.

<p>That accomplishment feels "very good," said Jim Dunne, director of Physical Plant. Dunne was a co-manager, along with Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program intern Louise Huttinger, of the project that certified the Engineering 2 building.</p>
<p>"We actually changed the way the building operated, and the way the building occupants operated," Dunne said.</p>
<p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, developed and administered by the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council, provides a framework for measuring and implementing building sustainability.</p>
<p>The LEED rating system offers four certification levels for new construction--Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum--that correspond to the number of credits accrued in five green design categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. LEED standards cover new commercial construction and major renovation projects, interiors projects, and existing building operations.</p>
<p>The Engineering 2 building was awarded a Silver rating. Obtaining the certification was part of a UC-wide mandate by the Office of the President, according to Dunne.</p>
<p>Working with every unit in Physical Plant, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, Physical Planning &amp; Construction, the Grounds Department, and the Purchasing Department, Dunne and Huttinger completed an 18-month review and submitted a 530-page certification document for the Engineering 2 building, which was built in 2004.</p>
<p>The submittal detailed every aspect of construction and operation for the building. For example, with the Grounds Department, the team inspected how rainwater leaves the site in an effort to figure out how to reduce sediment in the natural campus streams.</p>
<p>The team measured everything imaginable in the building to make sure they had the most efficient possible systems: Irrigation, heating and cooling, waste, lighting.</p>
<p>For example, they did an audit and identified stuff in the waste stream that could be recycled. Using this data, with cooperation from building occupants, they reduced the waste stream and increased recycling by 37 percent.</p>
<p>For Huttinger, the experience taught her "an incredible amount about the environmental aspect of buildings, but also why retrofitting is important."</p>
<p>"I learned a lot of things that are really complicated that you don't learn in class," Huttinger said.</p>
<p>Huttinger, a senior majoring in environmental studies, passed the LEED Accredited Professional exam in December, becoming likely one of only a handful of students with this certification, said Dunne.</p>
<p>Physical Plant custodians now clean the building with certified sustainable cleaning products, and even the floor mats are made from recycled plastic bottles.</p>
<p>The efforts they made to gain LEED certification have translated into a savings of 276,000 kWh of electricity and 17,000 therms of natural gas, decreasing costs by $44,000 per year, according to Dunne.</p>
<p>The LEED project also received points for an onsite tree re-planting program developed by the campus arborist, Roger Edburg.</p>
<p>Dunne and Huttinger were invited to present their project experience at the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, in November. After the presentation, Dunne was invited to participate in a U.S. Green Building Council review team for the next LEED revision, a volume certification process for agencies with numerous buildings.</p>
<p>And now Physical Plant is taking what it's learned during the LEED process and applying it to other buildings on campus, said Dunne.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915af9a58072704601a012ffab31cac9"><name>2927</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Lizzie Buchen</title><summary>Graduate certificate, science communication</summary><keywords>Lizzie Buchen</keywords><description>Graduate certificate, science communication</description><start-date>1241593200000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2927</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2927</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338912625</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338912625</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/buchen.lizzie.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/buchen.lizzie.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>buchen.lizzie.300.jpg</name><file-size>71499</file-size><width>300</width><height>356</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lizzie Buchen (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Lizzie Buchen </p><p><b>Age:</b> 26</p><p><b>Degree:</b> Graduate Certificate</p><p><b>Field of study:</b> Science communication</p><p><b>Faculty adviser:</b> Robert Irion</p><p><b>Undergraduate education:</b> Tufts University</p><p><b>Graduate education:</b> UCSF, M.S. in neuroscience</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Irvine, CA</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>Too many experiences to pick just one, but they all involve my classmates.

To distinguish one as my favorite is difficult, but if I have to choose, I would say, <i>Multi-Media Ethnography</i> taught by Shelly Errington during winter 2007. This course allowed me the opportunity to enhance my documentary skills with an ethnographic/anthropological approach and provided me with a theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on documentary experience.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>Usually the most memorable experiences are the unplanned, spontaneous events. The informal "naked run" on the first rain of the school year is listed in my top 10 most memorable experiences here at UCSC. Where else, other than Santa Cruz, will you find half the student body, running/walking through redwoods, singing and laughing while unclothed in pouring rain? This moment, for me, encompasses the freedom and spirit of our student body.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>My favorite spot on campus is a bench that sits atop a hill in Cowell College overlooking the recreational fields, the City of Santa Cruz, and the Pacific Ocean. The bench allows me to meditate and appreciate the beauty of our campus and city.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>The professors, students, and staff members I have worked and studied with at UCSC have deepened my understanding about the complexities of the world and have enlightened and empowered my well-being. I am forever thankful for all those whom I have had the privilege to work with.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>Throughout this next year, I plan to continue working on current video and multimedia projects, travel, and apply to graduate school. I've decided I'll eternally be a student at heart and hopefully will have the opportunity to share the knowledge I have acquired with others by teaching in the later years of my life. Until  then, I have many languages I want to learn and many cultures I want understand and explore.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>As a transfer student from UC San Diego, I was assigned Merrill College. Since transferring, I have mostly lived off campus, which has limited my interaction with Merrill College. Although, when visiting the academic office, the college advisers have always been extremely kind and helpful. Last fall, Merrill College also awarded me a faculty mentorship grant.  </p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Ashley received the Merrill College Mentorship Grant to work on postproduction of "April in Santa Cruz 2007," a performance by faculty in the Department of Music. Recently she has been working on cinematography and postproduction for musical works by assistant professor Benjamin Carson. </p><p>Her latest project involves the Education for Sustainable Living Program, under the aegis of College Eight and the Student Environmental Center. Last fall she joined the ESLP program as an unpaid intern, became co-chair of the student organization, and, with another student, invented a course, <i>ESLP through a Lens,</i> which she is currently teaching (spring '09). Ashley and her co-teacher received a grant of $7,000 for equipment to teach this class of 16 students the theoretical, ethical, and technical aspects of documentation; and the class will be producing six short multimedia pieces about the work of the various student environmental sustainability projects on campus.</p><p>Ashley is the first in her family to go to college. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b04a08072704601a012ff4981d9a2"><name>2934</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists develop new technology for tracking algal toxins</title><summary>A new tool for tracking algal toxins is under development at UCSC.</summary><author>Christina S.

The grains in the bag, though, are actually tiny porous resin beads that selectively absorb domoic acid, a naturally occurring neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning in people and seizures in marine mammals.</p><p>Scientists envision hanging the resin-filled sachets off piers and wharfs in California to continuously track nearshore toxin levels, similar to what is being done through sentinel "mussel watch" programs. The project is led by Raphael Kudela, a professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, and funded by the California Sea Grant program.</p><p>"What we have done is produce a passive, quantitative man-made sentinel mussel," Kudela said. "But unlike a real mussel, our mussel is not sensitive to salinity extremes or vulnerable to red tides."</p><p>The artificial mussel is an adaptation of a technology developed five years ago in New Zealand, known as SPATT, short for Solid Phase Absorption Toxin Testing. While the original SPATT was designed to absorb lipophilic (lipid-loving) algal neurotoxins such as saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, the new SPATT comes with resin beads that absorb domoic acid, a hydrophilic molecule.</p><p>The gist of the Sea Grant project was finding and testing this resin and a solvent for stripping domoic acid from it.</p><p>"We hang both the original SPATT and the new SPATT from the Santa Cruz Wharf to track the full complement of lipophilic and hydrophilic algal toxins," said UCSC graduate student Jenny Lane.</p><p>"The whole point is to track the comings and goings of toxins that we miss with weekly water sampling," added Meiling Roddam, a UCSC undergraduate who is also involved in the project.</p><p>Domoic acid is a naturally occurring molecule produced by diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Mussels, oysters, and fishes (such as sardines and anchovies) that feed on algae can accumulate the toxin, causing poisoning in animals that eat them.</p><p>A current limitation of SPATT is that it does not measure toxin levels within algal cells. Instead, it measures that small fraction of a toxin that leaks from cells into water. To measure the true total domoic acid content of a volume of water, the scientists are exploring the idea of pumping seawater samples into glass jars containing cell-lysing compounds. The resin sachets would then be placed in these jars.</p><p>Kudela said he wants to measure domoic acid in cells because "organisms are not drinking domoic acid, they are ingesting cells that contain it." </p><p>Besides working on the pumping and lysing system, the scientists plan to use the current iteration of SPATT to trace the sources of freshwater algal toxins called microcystins (which are also hydrophilic molecules) that marine biologists believe have killed at least five federally protected sea otters in Monterey Bay.</p><p>"We know where the otters live and where they eat, but we have no idea where the toxins are coming from," Kudela said. "The idea is to put the resin out in rivers, creeks and freshwater overflows that discharge into Monterey Bay."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b06108072704601a012ffdc2a0282"><name>2935</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lab fire leads to building evacuation; 'minimal' damage and no injuries reported</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1241679600000</start-date><display-name>Lab fire leads to...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2935</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2935</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338915808</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338915808</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A fire that sparked in a chemistry lab on the third floor of UCSC's Physical Sciences Building this afternoon was quickly extinguished by campus fire crews.

Jurica.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>At the beginning of her first quarter at UC Santa Cruz, freshman biology student Kimberly Davis collected some soil from the forest floor near Thimann Labs. She then isolated a bacterial virus from the soil, took pictures of it with an electron microscope, extracted the virus's DNA, sent it off for sequencing by the national laboratories' Joint Genome Institute, and is now analyzing the DNA sequence and studying the virus's genes.</p>
<p>It's all part of the Phage Genomics Lab course, in which a select group of students get to dive straight into research, while also taking the usual introductory biology lectures. Davis and her 13 classmates are making real contributions to scientific understanding of the genetic diversity of bacterial viruses (also known as bacteriophages or phages). Ultimately, they plan to publish their findings in a scientific journal.</p>
<p>"It's a really innovative way to learn and a great introduction to science," Davis said. "This is real research, discovering things that people don't already know, and that's really cool."</p>
<p>Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They are so widespread that they are thought to kill off a significant fraction of the bacteria on the planet every day, said Grant Hartzog, associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental (MCD) biology. Because of their abundance and diversity, they represent one of the largest reservoirs of genetic diversity on the planet.</p>
<p>"When the students isolate their own virus, they are guaranteed to find something new," Hartzog said.</p>
<p>Students in the class isolated phages from locations all over campus, including the Alan Chadwick Garden, the Arboretum, and the Pogonip. The phage isolated by Davis infects a benign soil bacterium (related to the tuberculosis bacterium, although it does not cause disease). She named it "Little Red Riding Hood" in recognition of its forest origins. It has a large genome for a bacteriophage, consisting of about 150,000 base pairs of DNA that encode more than 200 genes.</p>
<p>"It's been a lot of work. I spent a lot of my free time in the lab, but it's really fun to see the results, and knowing that we'll write a paper about it is very gratifying," Davis said. "I think most of us in the class have decided we want to continue to do scientific research."</p>
<p>Hartzog said the course has clearly succeeded in getting students excited and engaged in their studies. It also prepares students for research in faculty labs and provides concrete examples of many of the principles that they learn in their lecture courses.</p>
<p>"We want to get them involved in research as early as possible in their college careers to enrich the quality of their experience here and give them the best chance for success after they leave," Hartzog said.</p>
<p>The course is funded for three years by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which is sponsoring similar lab courses at 12 institutions around the country as part of the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/12/1802.html">Science Education Alliance</a>. At UCSC, Hartzog teaches the lab together with Manuel Ares, professor of MCD biology.</p>
<p>"It's a problem-solving class. They have a task to do and they learn by doing," Ares said.</p>
<p>Ares and Hartzog selected the students for the class after inviting applications from incoming freshmen with strong backgrounds in high school biology.</p>
<p>"When you have a curriculum that's designed to serve a very heterogeneous mix of students, the more accomplished students can end up feeling neglected. We have to work harder to keep those students engaged," Ares said. "The way most practicing scientists know facts is by the experiments that prove them, and this course provides an experimental context that is absent from most lecture classes."</p>
<p>The HHMI funding paid for the sequencing of only one phage genome, so Davis was thrilled when hers was chosen. Hartzog subsequently obtained a grant from the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) that paid for the sequencing of all the other phages isolated by the class.</p>
<p>Ares has created a web-based Phage Genome Browser that the students use to analyze the viral DNA sequences. The browser, which provides a variety of tools for studying genome sequences, is based on the widely used UCSC Genome Browser created and maintained by researchers at the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot about sequencing and sequence analysis. It takes awhile to realize how much information there is in the browser," said student Jessica Ruby.</p>
<p>Ares and Hartzog plan to build on their experiences with this course to provide similar opportunities for a larger number of students and faculty.</p>
<p>"The lab may eventually evolve into a series of one-quarter courses that would involve more students," Hartzog said. "We can also create other courses, such as a bioinformatics course that would focus on analyzing the novel sequence data we are acquiring. The idea is to use this as a catalyst to create other fun and interesting teaching and learning opportunities on campus."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b0f458072704601a012ff560875e4"><name>2941</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rajan to study management of environmental risks in India</title><summary>With a new NSF grant, S.

Ravi Rajan, associate professor of environmental studies and provost of College Eight, has received a major grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate the intersection of science, democracy, and environmental risk in India.</p><p>Rajan's project will expand the field of science and technology studies to include the largest democracy in the world. </p><p>"We want to understand how science advocacy in the process of public policy regarding environmental risks is constrained by politics," said Rajan. "Science policy is much more political than scientists are typically willing to concede." Rajan received a grant of nearly $190,000 for the work.</p><p>During the three-year project, Rajan will lead a team of graduate students in environmental studies who will investigate how science, politics, and policy interact in three sectors in India: hazard and impact assessment, chronic risk mitigation, and emergent risks. Case studies in the three areas will focus on the decision to build a large dam in a seismically active area, the mandate to fuel vehicles in Delhi only with compressed natural gas, and the introduction of genetically modified cotton in agriculture. Rajan and his students will also investigate other case studies in each sector in India and elsewhere in the Third World.</p><p>"Most policy making is predicated upon what scientists say needs to get done, but environmental policymaking is peculiar, because different scientific groups make different claims about what the risks are and how they need to be managed," said Rajan. "We don't understand how those dynamics work in places like Brazil, India, and Mexico--democracies where people have the freedom to interact. The exact ways a specific policy initiative wins remain mysterious."</p><p>During the past decade, scholarship in this area has focused on the advanced industrial nations of North America and Western Europe, noted Rajan. </p><p>"We blindly apply risk-management strategies that have been developed in the United States and export them to developing countries, but we need to understand the economic, social, and political contexts in which risk decisions get made," he said. "This project will help fill a gap in the literature about the role of scientific expertise in environmental controversies that are playing out in the developing world."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b116c8072704601a012ffdc435920"><name>2942</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Michael Beirne</title><summary>B.A. music, mathematics</summary><description>B.A. music, mathematics</description><start-date>1242025200000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2942</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2942</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338918713</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338918713</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/bierne_michael.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/bierne_michael.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bierne_michael.300.jpg</name><file-size>73972</file-size><width>300</width><height>326</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Michael Beirne (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Michael Beirne</p><p><b>Age:</b> 22</p><p><b>Majors:</b> Music and mathematics</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Folsom, CA</p><p><b>UCSC College:</b> Eight</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why?</b></p><p>Thinking over four years at UCSC, the professor who stands out is Amy Beal. In the undergraduate Music Department, she teaches the two later music history courses and runs the Contemporary Music Ensemble (CME). The amazing amount of effort she throws into her courses with regards to interest in the material and organization in presentation is highly contagious. Under her direction, CME has been the best end to every week. The first rehearsal we ever had consisted of making rock music, literally with rocks. With frequent exploration into group improvisation, modern composition, and individual creativity all the troubles of the previous week seem to melt away. I feel very honored to have had her as a professor the past two years, and I look forward to the rest of the time I have under her direction.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>I took a class last year offered by Porter called the <i>Ways of Knowing.</i> Individual classes ranged from a movement day to an exploration of our sense of smell. There was a mandatory project for which I learned to juggle, and there were presentation days when students would show the class an art project or evaluation of the readings. Discussion topics ranged from recognition of "the other" to use of transitional objects. Classes sometimes bordered on group therapy, but all in all, it was definitely one of my most interesting experiences at UCSC and an intriguing look into differing ways of understanding the world around us.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>There is one couch in the Music Center facing the bay through a full-length window. Being away from the usual path of most music students, it avoids the constant sound emanating from most halls. In short, over the years, that couch has been the location of a lot of work, more procrastination, and even more napping.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>I'm most grateful for the way I've been able to grow academically at UCSC. I was lucky enough to end up in two of the smaller departments on campus, which led to relatively small class sizes and closer relationships with my professors. Through that experience, I was able to stay involved in classes and continue a great appreciation for the learning process in general. On a more subconscious level, UCSC has successfully implanted a negative visceral reaction at the sight of polystyrene products and the absence of recycle bins.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>I do not have any definite plans at the moment, but have recently gained some interest into the study of acoustics (the physics of sound). For my math exit seminar, I had the chance to look into the application of number theory onto tuning theory and found the process quite enlightening. Graduate school is definitely in the near future, though I am not sure where and for what yet.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>Honestly, I chose College Eight because I already knew some people who were going there, and it had a great view. The core course was an interesting overview on the relationship between humans and their environment. The college system in general creates a unique sort of pride tied to your college of origin. It's interesting to be able to relate similar experiences with other College Eight members, whether it be late night dining hall stories or the preponderance of Uggs.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Beyond graduating with a double degree in four years while working anywhere from two to four jobs a quarter, I've been able to apply myself most to the Music Department. I have been a member of several chamber groups and larger ensembles, including the Gamelan and Contemporary Music Ensemble. I am a four-year member of the UCSC Orchestra and have helped them to present several premieres. With the UCSC Chamber Singers I've also participated in the presentation of award-winning opera productions. For the last two years, I've worked as the orchestra manager, under conductor Nicole Paiement. I mostly work to help our humble 60-piece symphonic orchestra run smoother. Finally, after four years of working with violinist Roy Malan, I was awarded the opportunity to present a solo recital on the violin, with works by composers ranging from Bach to Smetana. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b13118072704601a012ffe5eb4fb3"><name>2943</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Predictable fun at Prediction Walk/Run</title><summary>The campus community got in the spirit for last week's OPERS Prediction Walk/Run, a relay in which each person on a team of four tried to predict his or her time to run or walk half a mile.</summary><keywords>Prediction Walk/Run</keywords><description>The campus community got in the spirit for last week's OPERS Prediction Walk/Run, a relay in which each person on a team of four tried to predict his or her time to run or walk half a mile.</description><start-date>1242025200000</start-date><display-name>Predictable fun at Prediction...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2943</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2943</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338919110</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338919110</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/prediction.walk.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/prediction.walk.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>prediction.walk.300.jpg</name><file-size>49394</file-size><width>300</width><height>385</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The campus community got in the spirit for last week's OPERS Prediction Walk/Run, a relay in which each person on a team of four tried to predict his or her time to run or walk half a mile.</p><p>Hitting the track here are staff members Janet Mastropietro of McHenry Library;

Faber</p><p><b>Undergraduate education:</b> Harvard</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Albany, CA</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>The most memorable aspect of my time at UCSC is not a single event, but a continuum of experiences: the meetings with my thesis adviser.  I would sometimes come into those meetings feeling discouraged or distracted, but conversations with Sandy always energized me and reinvigorated my drive to understand the universe.  The intensity of those discussions and the open mulling of scientific ideas was the most exciting part of my graduate study.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>The trail that leads from the ARCenter to the base of campus. It is a quiet, open walk with gorgeous views across the Monterey Bay. I meet more animals on the trail (deer, birds, gophers, snakes, even a bobcat!) than people. Walking there clears my head and makes me feel connected to the natural world when I need it most.</p><p><b>How has your UCSC graduate education shaped you professionally?</b></p><p>The UCSC Astronomy Department has been both a supportive and a challenging academic home in which to become an astronomer. The continuous engagement, particularly the informal discussions with faculty, postdocs, and other grads over coffee and in the halls has been wonderful. It has helped me develop a broader perspective on the field, as well as honing my abilities to explain my work, rethink my work, and engage with the work of other astronomers.  </p><p><b>What are your plans after graduation?</b></p><p>I will be a Fellow at the Miller Institute for Basic Research at UC Berkeley. This fellowship gives me three years of support and research funding to pursue my own research program, with no other formal duties. The Miller Institute gathers together its members--fellows, faculty, and visiting faculty from all fields of science--for a weekly lunch in order to foster discussion and interaction between scientists in a variety of disciplines. I am very excited to be a part of this intellectual community of scientists.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>My thesis research has focused on the formation and evolution of a particular class of galaxies, which include the biggest galaxies in the Universe. Our own Milky Way is continuously forming new stars, and with them new planetary systems and possibly new worlds such as our own. In contrast, the galaxies I study are "dead" systems that have stopped forming stars. A major unsolved problem in astronomy is when and how star formation ended in these galaxies. These galaxies had active lives in the early universe, forming most of their stars within a few billion years after the Big Bang at a time that is difficult to observe with even the most powerful telescopes. My research could therefore be described as "galactic forensics": I look at what is left of the galaxy and try to determine "who killed NGC 4881?"  </p><p>I have received a number of awards and fellowships while a graduate student. These include the UCSC Astronomy Department Whitford Prize for excellence in research and course work through the second year, a Regent's Fellowship, an ARCS Foundation Fellowship, and a Chancellor's Dissertation Year Fellowship. I have also written a successful Hubble Space Telescope proposal to look at the ultraviolet light from galaxies that have recently stopped forming stars in order to identify the last sites of star formation in these objects, which included $160,000 in research grant money.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b197e8072704601a012ff987d7660"><name>2947</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Randy Nguyen</title><summary>B.A., sociology</summary><keywords>Randy Nguyen</keywords><description>B.A., sociology</description><start-date>1242111600000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2947</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2947</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338920754</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338920754</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/nguyen.randy.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/nguyen.randy.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nguyen.randy.300.jpg</name><file-size>51659</file-size><width>300</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Randy Nguyen (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Randy Nguyen</p><p><b>Age:</b> 21</p><p><b>Major:</b> Sociology</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> San Jose, CA</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Stevenson </p><p> </p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why? </b></p><p><i>Popular Culture,</i> taught by Professor Julie Bettie. The level and amount of dialogue that sprung up from this class on topics such as class, race, and gender issues were many and varied. This class was rewarding in that it gave me the opportunity to explore and understand the social world that I live in through research and in-depth discussions. The highlight of the class came about when we had a female bodybuilder come to give us a talk about her career path, and to our surprise, a demonstration that included volunteers being lifted and carried. Little did they know what she had in store for them.</p><p> </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC? </b></p><p>It was a sad day when I came to realize that my days here at UCSC were numbered. I've had countless memorable experiences. One of them occurred recently during a hiking expedition with my friends behind Crown and Merrill colleges. We got lost, and it took us forever to find our way back to a hiking trail. The memorable part of this story was when we began to give each other nature names. My friends gave me the title "Tick Boy" because I was always seen scratching myself throughout the expedition. We finally made our way out of the forest but only after an hour of getting lost. Experiences like these may be simple, but they are the ones that stick out to me, and they'll always remind me of my college days spent in Santa Cruz.</p><p> </p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why? </b></p><p>My favorite spot on campus may seem a bit awkward. It is not a scenic location, nor is it a fancy place. It is a conference room on the third floor of the Bay Tree Bookstore. Back in the day, it used to be called Conference Room D. But nowadays, in honor of the Natives who inhabited the land before we came along, the room has been renamed the Cervantes and Velasquez Conference Room. Part of the reason this conference room is my favorite spot on campus is because it is where I have met up with my friends every Monday of the quarter since freshman year to plan events for the Chinese Student Association. This room is my favorite spot because it is where I have made so many memories. I heart CSA.</p><p> </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you? </b></p><p>UCSC has shaped me in many ways and on so many different levels. Through my courses, I have become a better-informed member of society. Through taking part in student-initiated organizations, I have been able to see myself as one who can make a difference. And last, by interning at the Asian American Pacific Islander Resource Center, I have been able to develop leadership skills as well as professional skills to prepare myself for the world. Before, I was told that the sky was the limit, but now I believe that there is no limit to the possibilities of things that I can accomplish.</p><p> </p><p><b>What are your future plans? </b></p><p>Isn't this the question that we all find ourselves asking as we near the end of our undergraduate journey here at UCSC? I personally have many things that I want to do after I graduate. Life is an adventure, and I plan on keeping it that way. I have plans to join the Peace Corps and go abroad to work with less fortunate communities. I also want to take on career paths such as a firefighter, an ambulance technician, and perhaps even an educator. If I were to choose the last career path then perhaps I might even consider going to graduate school to complete my M.A. and, if possible, earn a Ph.D.</p><p> </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education? </b></p><p>How I came to decide which college to be a part of is a pretty long story. In the end, though, I stuck with Stevenson College because of its theme, "Self and Society." I find it ironic that I came to UCSC as an undeclared in health sciences and will be graduating this June with a B.A. in sociology. I guess my passion really lies within the social sciences.</p><p> </p><p><b>Accomplishments: </b></p><p>Since arriving in Santa Cruz, I have been able to accomplish many goals. A personal goal that I take much pride in is that I am the second person in my family to complete four years of college and to earn a degree. Apart from graduating from UCSC, my biggest accomplishment has been being able to make a difference through being involved with the Asian American/Pacific Islander community here on campus. Through volunteering with student-initiated organizations, namely the Chinese Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Association, and interning at the Asian American Pacific Islander Resource Center, I have been able strengthen the diverse UCSC campus by organizing events that create a space for coalition-building and student representation and voices. Also, through these organizations I have been able to develop leadership and professional skills in group settings, which will greatly help me with future endeavors. Last but not least, through all of my experiences, I have been able to make many wonderful friends and have unforgettable experiences.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b1b3c8072704601a012ff66466b2a"><name>2948</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff members socialize under the sun at Staff Appreciation Picnic</title><summary>Entertainment including live music and informational tables greeted staff members as they streamed onto the East Field for the annual Staff Appreciation Picnic, put on by the Staff Advisory Board. </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Staff Appreciation Picnic</keywords><description>Entertainment including live music and informational tables greeted staff members as they streamed onto the East Field for the annual Staff Appreciation Picnic, put on by the Staff Advisory Board. </description><start-date>1242111600000</start-date><display-name>Staff members socialize under...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2948</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2948</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338921185</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338921185</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/hollinger.jacob.smoothie.bike.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/hollinger.jacob.smoothie.bike.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hollinger.jacob.smoothie.bike.300.jpg</name><file-size>52922</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jacob Hollinger pedals his way to a smoothie as Carolyn Jett of People Power makes sure the healthy treat stays in the blender. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/blumenthal.george.staff.picnic.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/blumenthal.george.staff.picnic.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blumenthal.george.staff.picnic.300.jpg</name><file-size>51433</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor Blumenthal gets on the serving line. </image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/nelson.guy.staff.picnic.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/nelson.guy.staff.picnic.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nelson.guy.staff.picnic.300.jpg</name><file-size>36734</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Guy Nelson relaxes with coworkers. </image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/calderon.santiago.staff.picnic.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/calderon.santiago.staff.picnic.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>calderon.santiago.staff.picnic.300.jpg</name><file-size>32067</file-size><width>300</width><height>239</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Santiago Calderon of Admissions and Rhonda Rhodes of Staff HR soak up warm sunshine and hot blues.

Performance appraisals are required annually for all career staff employees and are an essential component of a successful performance management program. I ask for your full participation in making this another record year in the performance completion rate for each division. We had a 96% completion rate for the 2007-08 review period, which was an improvement over the previous year. This is an impressive record and I hope we will improve even more this year.</p><p>Overall, the process this year is essentially the same as last year. The main difference is in the forms themselves. This year, the appraisal forms include a section on health and safety to be used by all supervisors and managers to provide feedback to all employees for the current review period, July 2008 through June 2009. All appraisal forms are provided on line at: <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/forms.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/forms.htm</a></p><p>As in past years, I strongly encourage principal officers to establish divisional guidelines that outline expectations for the performance review process and establish requirements for use of the standardized forms. Your division may choose to designate the use of one or more specific forms, depending on the job responsibilities of employees being reviewed.</p><p>Completed and signed performance appraisals should be submitted to the appropriate service team in Staff Human Resources (SHR) by close of business on Friday, August 14, 2009. Managers and supervisors who leave for the summer months or supervise staff on summer furloughs are encouraged to complete the required forms in May or June in order to meet the August 14 deadline.</p><p>The completion of the performance appraisal is an important final step in the 2008-09 performance management process. This announcement is being sent to all managers, supervisors, staff and faculty who supervise staff. SHR also provides classroom training and in-house briefings for learning performance management skills. If you have not already done so, I recommend that you enroll in the existing Performance Management Series. A new web based training program is available on line at:</p><p><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/pm_training.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/pm_training.htm</a>.</p><p>For further information regarding the performance management process, please contact your service team or the Manager of the SHR Management Services Team, Cecile Morris (x9-3935 or <a href="mailto:cecile@ucsc.edu">cecile@ucsc.edu</a>).</p><p>cc:  UCSC Academic Employees</p><p>     UCSC Staff Employees</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Willeen McQuitta, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b20e98072704601a012ff4cbeb067"><name>2952</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Retirees group awards student scholarships</title><summary>The UCSC Silver Slugs presented six students with scholarships at their May event at the Arboretum.</summary><description>The UCSC Silver Slugs presented six students with scholarships at their May event at the Arboretum.</description><start-date>1243321200000</start-date><display-name>Retirees group awards student...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2952</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2952</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338922679</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338922679</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Silver Slugs presented six students with $500 scholarships at their May Dessert Event at the Arboretum.</p>

(Photos by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ron Davis was on his second mini-breakfast of the morning.</p>
<p>The Physical Plant project manager was hanging out at the Women's Center early Thursday enjoying free coffee and snacks, his right for pedaling up to campus as part of <a href="http://www.bike2work.com/s_cruz/index.html">Bike to Work/School Day</a>.</p>
<p>"It's great to see all the other bike commuters and say hi," said Davis, who was checking out a table full of bike literature while holding a half-eaten slice of cinnamon-raisin-walnut bread slathered with peanut butter.</p>
<p>The Women's Center, along with two other places on campus, was one of Bike to Work/School Day's free breakfast sites. Earlier, Davis and his son, a student at Georgiana Bruce Kirby Preparatory School, stopped at Jamba Juice in downtown Santa Cruz, another free breakfast spot.</p>
<p>"Downtown was packed," said Davis, a Live Oak resident who bikes to work a couple of days a week.</p>
<p>Bike to Work, a project of nonprofit environmental consultancy Ecology Action, is a 20-year-old program that provides incentives for commuters to travel by bicycle. According to the Bike to Work web site, there's been a 50 percent increase in Bike to Work/School Day participation over the past four years.</p>
<p>Breakfast at the Women's Center was "going well," said Colin Brown, a senior majoring in environmental studies and a member of UCSC's bike team. Brown and a few other bike team members were running things at the Women's Center breakfast station.</p>
<p>Despite having to get up early to man the station, Brown enjoyed seeing people pedaling up the hill and stopping for a bite. By about 8:30 a.m. or so, they'd gotten 25-30 cyclist breakfast-takers.</p>
<p>"It's certainly nice to see people riding to work or campus," Brown said. "You get to meet a lot of cool people."</p>
<p>Tunes drifted out of a Mac laptop set up on a table spread with donated breakfast goodies: bread from Beckmann's Old World Bakery, strawberries, Odwalla orange juice, Clif bars, coffee, peanut butter, cream cheese, and bagels.</p>
<p>For people like Brown, a self-described " lifestyle cyclist" who doesn't own a car, biking around town is a normal day-to-day thing. So he likes seeing other realize they can do that, too.</p>
<p>"I think of a lot of people think biking to work is harder than it is," he said. "So giving them a reason to do it once gets them in the habit of it."</p>
<p>Tara Neier, a Santa Cruz community member who stopped at the Women's Center with her family, agreed. Neier and her husband, Gary, bike up to campus with their 2-year-old son, Terry, a couple of days a week for swimming classes.</p>
<p>"I think it needs to be more than one day," said Neier. "But it's good to give general people that one day to focus on, and then they realize if they can do it one day, they can maybe do it one other day."</p>
<p>Toddler Terry was not convinced.</p>
<p>"I wanna go home," the little boy said.</p>
<p>But dad persuaded him to go check out the snacks.</p>

It is rather uncommon for a doctoral student to get both. It is great to get such recognition in both teaching and research! </p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>The Re-entry Student Center at the ARC, right above the music center. It is a splendid location with a gorgeous view of the ocean, and it houses the wonderful STARS staff--they are fabulously supportive and have provided a great place for me to feel at home on campus whenever I needed it.</p><p><b>How has your UCSC graduate education shaped you professionally?</b></p><p>I was born and raised in Southern Italy and come from a nontraditional background. UCSC offers a rather casual, small-town environment, with an appreciation for the value of what is original, different, creative, and nontraditional. This can be helpful in getting to know faculty quite well, working inter-departmentally and inter-disciplinarily, and forging good collegial connections. It was really great for me to be able to be involved at campus level in university service, spending much time on academic committees. I learned how academia really functions as a system, and how power and politics play a part in the life of the institution.  That, together with a lot of teaching and research, gave me a reality-based, fairly clear professional vision of who I want to be as a scholar. </p><p><b>What are your plans after graduation?</b></p><p>Looking for a publisher for my book (I believe my thesis can be published as a book for a fairly wide audience), co-authoring a couple of projects, writing and chilling out for some time, waiting to see what happens with the economy and what opportunities open up. </p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b> </p><p>My entire journey in this country has been a huge accomplishment. In the United States population, less than 1 percent of women complete doctoral degrees; doing that in a second language, as a single parent, and an immigrant, pushes even further in outlier territory. </p><p>I have deeply enjoyed working on my thesis project, titled Love in America. It is an ethnographic study of emotions, and particularly love, in cross-cultural perspective. My research explores cultural differences in the perception and construction of attraction, affect, love, and sexuality. Unique courtship repertoires (defined as "dating") separate American culture from most other societies; I seek to provide some light on matters of the human heart, and the powerful yet subtle way in which culture produces specific scripts and expectations on how romantic passages occur within a given society. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b25d88072704601a012ff112beafb"><name>2955</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Janelle Yong</title><summary>B.S., electrical engineering</summary><keywords>Janelle Yong</keywords><description>B.S., electrical engineering</description><start-date>1242370800000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2955</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2955</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338923916</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338923916</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/yong_janelle2.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/yong_janelle2.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yong_janelle2.300.jpg</name><file-size>63727</file-size><width>300</width><height>336</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Janelle Yong (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Janelle Yong</p><p><b>Age:</b> 23</p><p><b>Major:</b> Electrical engineering </p><p><b>Hometown:</b> Atwater, CA	</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Porter</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why?</b></p><p>My favorite classes have been <i>Microprocessor System Design</i> and <i>Analog Circuits,</i> both taught by Professor Stephen Petersen. He best prepared me for practical engineering by teaching me how to keep a proper engineering notebook, how to design with proper methods, and, most importantly, how to think like an engineer.  He showed us that what we learn in class will eventually be applied once we get to industry and beyond. Even though I didn't receive the best grades in these classes, I feel like I walked away learning so much more than in a class I received an "A" in.  </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>Some of the most memorable experiences were being invited to the Annual Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame Banquets. I got to sit at a table over dinner and network with very influential people who shaped what Silicon Valley has become today. Two inductees to the Hall of Fame have even included the former dean of the School of Engineering, Steve Kang, and Jack Baskin himself. Being able to attend and talk with them about how they struggled through school and found jobs after college reassured me that I had a future in engineering. </p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>My favorite spot on campus is the bench at the base of the stairs in between the Baskin and Engineering 2 buildings. I love taking my coffee breaks sitting there on nice days in the sun and looking out into the trees in between the buildings, even if for only five minutes.  </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>UCSC has provided me with the means and resources to pursue what I've always dreamed of doing. With the supportive staff and faculty and a strong network of peers, it made my experience in the School of Engineering more inviting and less stressful. I would still consider myself as driven and as studious as I was before, but I am much more confident in being the successful woman in engineering that I have become.  </p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>I have been accepted into the Ph.D. program for electrical engineering to continue here at UC Santa Cruz under the Cota-Robles Fellowship starting in the fall. I will be continuing my research with the Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Research Laboratory under the direction of Professor Joel Kubby. I would also like to continue the work I have done for the School of Engineering toward outreach and retention for underrepresented students in engineering.  </p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>Since I was practically born on the stage dancing and acting, I wanted to choose a college that would provide an environment and an outlet for performing arts. I knew that I would be immersed in studying and working in the labs for engineering, so I wanted that perfect balance. However, it still amuses me when people are surprised that I'm an engineer from Porter. </p><p>  </p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Among the many accomplishments earned during my college career, only a select few are most important to me. Academically, I have been awarded the Dean's Award and the Porter Undergraduate Research Fellowship for my thesis on the Design and Characterization of a MEMS Deformable Mirror. Deformable mirrors allow scientists to explore the field of adaptive optics, in which normally disruptive fluctuations can be corrected, allowing for unprecedented clarity in images. </p><p>Being the first to receive a bachelor's degree in my family, it makes me extremely honored to have been accepted to pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. </p><p>Additionally, I have held many positions for the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, including student ambassador, peer mentor, program coordinator and mentor for the Success in Engineering and Research Pathways Summer Bridge Program, and center assistant for the Multicultural Engineering Program. I helped in the development of programs, events, and workshops that provide primarily underrepresented students  with the tools necessary to succeed in engineering. I am proud to have maintained successful mentorships with most of my students, who are all continuing to do well in their studies.  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b273d8072704601a012ff306a23c3"><name>2956</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Third grader's question about soccer fields leads to UCSC science lab</title><summary>Third-grader Claire Dworsky is investigating her own questions about water quality in Adina Paytan's laboratory at UCSC.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><description>Third-grader Claire Dworsky is investigating her own questions about water quality in Adina Paytan's laboratory at UCSC.</description><start-date>1242370800000</start-date><display-name>Third grader's question about...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2956</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2956</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338924282</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338924282</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/claire_3_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/claire_3_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>claire_3_300.jpg</name><file-size>74526</file-size><width>300</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Third-grader Claire Dworsky brought her water samples to Adina Paytan's lab at UCSC for analysis.

Photo by Deanna Hodgin.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Marine scientist Adina Paytan has a new collaborator: third-grader Claire Dworsky of San Francisco, whose winning entry in the Kids' Science Challenge competition earned her the chance to investigate her own questions about water quality in Paytan's laboratory at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>An avid soccer player, Dworsky was curious about the differences between grass fields and artificial turf with respect to pollutants in the water that runs off the fields. Paytan said it was easy to pick her entry as a winner. "Her idea stemmed from genuine curiosity and observation," said Paytan, an associate research scientist in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.kidsciencechallenge.com">Kids' Science Challenge</a> is a nationwide competition for kids in grades 3 to 6 who were invited to submit experiments and problems for a select group of scientists and engineers to solve. This is the first year of the competition, which is funded by the National Science Foundation and created by Jim Metzner, producer of the <i>Pulse of the Planet</i> radio program.</p><p>In an interview with Metzner, Dworsky explained how she got interested in the runoff from soccer fields. "I look down and I see that the turf water compared with the grass water looks different, so that's why I'm trying to figure out what's going on...if turf fields pollute more than grass fields," she said.</p><p>Paytan has been involved in the Kids' Science Challenge since last year as an expert on water quality, one of four categories in the competition. She worked with local high school students to produce a promotional video for the program's web site, and she has spent many hours answering questions from children around the country in live online sessions.</p><p>"It has been a delight to work with Dr. Paytan, who continues to inspire Claire and the thousands of other kids who have visited kidsciencechallenge.com," Metzner said.</p><p>Paytan's own research addresses a wide range of questions involving the global systems that affect ocean productivity, seawater chemistry, nutrient cycles, and water pollution. She also devotes a lot of time to science education and outreach efforts, such as the Kids' Science Challenge.</p><p>"Part of our job as scientists is to communicate what we know to the general public. If we just talk to other scientists, the impacts are not as significant," she said.</p><p>After Dworsky's entry was chosen as a winner in March, Paytan discussed the project with her and sent her a package with supplies and instructions for collecting water samples. Dworsky collected 110 samples from 10 soccer fields in San Francisco, half with grass and half with artificial turf. She has made several trips to Paytan's lab at UCSC, where the samples will be analyzed, and will spend more time there over the summer. Paytan said the results of the study should be available by August.</p><p>After meeting Dworsky and starting to work on the project with her, Paytan said she continues to be impressed by her 8-year-old collaborator. "Obviously, her science background is not like a college student's, but she observes and asks good questions," Paytan said. "She's a smart kid, and she wants to take it to the next step. Beyond the science question, she's also interested in the decision-making process when communities decide to replace grass fields with artificial turf."</p><p>The issue has been controversial in some communities. According to Paytan, there are advantages and disadvantages to both types of fields. Dworsky's investigation of runoff from grass and artificial turf won't resolve all the controversies, but it will address an issue that has not been well studied. Paytan said a search of the scientific literature did not turn up any prior studies like the one they are doing now.</p><p>"I couldn't find anything in the peer-reviewed journals that's comparable. No one has done an extensive comparison study of fields in the same city to look at what's coming off in the runoff," she said. "It just shows that a little girl can do something that's useful for everybody."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b28918072704601a012ff1070af27"><name>2957</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Astronomer Greg Laughlin is quoted in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discover&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; magazine's May cover story about the search for planets that might support life.</summary><description>Astronomer Greg Laughlin is quoted in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discover&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; magazine's May cover story about the search for planets that might support life.</description><start-date>1242370800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2957</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2957</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338924631</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338924631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Astronomer Greg Laughlin is quoted in <strong><em>Discover</em></strong> magazine's May cover story about the search for planets that might support life.</p>

I was pushed to the edge and challenged academically like no other class had done for me, but overall I learned more in those 10 weeks than in any other class.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b> </p><p>My most memorable experience was the day that, to my surprise, I found out about and met all the other Colombians at UCSC and ended up having <i>ajiaco</i>--a Colombian potato soup and a specialty of Bogota--with them at the Women's Center.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b> </p><p>I love walking through the Kresge Bridge, love the view of the redwood trees above me and below me.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b> </p><p>Through my growth at UCSC I learned the importance of working for your community and the power of organizing. I have met many individuals who challenged my experiences and shared their experiences with me and through which many times a completely different perspective and world opened to me.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>For now my plan is to go back to Colombia for a couple of years and work on a mental health project for children who have been displaced by the war.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b> </p><p>Kresge gave me my first opportunity to get involved with the UCSC community through Kresge Parliament and by being a Kresge representative at the Student Union Assembly (SUA). Through both of these a much larger UCSC community opened up to me.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>Through my years at UCSC I have been involved in a number of organizations from SUA, Kresge Parliament, CHE (Chicanos/Latina/os in Health Education), and the Colombian Research Cluster. I was also a Special Olympics coach and director for four years at UCSC.</p><p>Along with my on-campus participation, my experiences abroad in Costa Rica doing a conservation project, in Southern India doing a veterinary internship, and studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa, all have inspired me but mostly made me realize how globally privileged I am (we are!). Collectively these experiences have given me the perspective of different health issues and needs outside of the U.S. and allowed me to develop a strong public health commitment.</p><p>Summer and fall 2008 I was involved with the Health Services Agency of Santa Cruz County working on the Promoting Health Equities Committee, focusing on addressing the health and socioeconomic disparities in the county and encouraging organizations, government, and community members to start a dialogue and build community action around these issues in the county.</p><p>My overall goal is to end up working around health policy for displaced populations and refugees. I am considering a combined M.D. and M.P.H., but I need to take some time to make sure that is the route I want to embark on.</p><p>As a first-generation immigrant, who came to the U.S. from Colombia when I was 13 years old, I include my graduation from the university as a big accomplishment.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b2e218072704601a012ffede633e6"><name>2961</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Porter College class features alumni professionals working in TV and film</title><summary>For 13 years, alum Loren Steck has taught "Working in TV and Film."</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>porter, steck, television, film, industry, class, alumni, graduates, cantin</keywords><description>For 13 years, alum Loren Steck has taught "Working in TV and Film."</description><start-date>1242889200000</start-date><display-name>Porter College class features...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2961</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2961</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338926030</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338926030</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/cantin.270.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/cantin.270.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cantin.270.jpg</name><file-size>61202</file-size><width>270</width><height>317</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Alumna Marie Cantin gave students a "real world" view of life in film and television.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/cantin_fiji.270.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/cantin_fiji.270.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cantin_fiji.270.jpg</name><file-size>63967</file-size><width>270</width><height>412</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Producers have to be ready to do anything, including pick up the trash, said Cantin, on the set of a project in Fiji.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For 13 years, UCSC alum Loren Steck has partnered with fellow alumni and Porter College to offer a class called "Working in TV and Film," which features working Hollywood professionals who captivate students with accounts of life in the entertainment industry.</p><p>And for 13 years, students preparing to build their own careers in the industry have responded to this glimpse of the "real world" with course evaluations like these:</p><p>. "Finally, a course that gives you heavy details and prepares you." </p><p>. "This course was extremely valuable!  Every lecturer was knowledgeable."  </p><p>. "I learned a lot of relevant information that I'm sure will really help me down the line.  Where most classes give me a lot of theoretical knowledge, I really liked the practical focus of this one." </p><p>The class is a labor of love for Steck (B.A., independent major, Porter College, 1973), a Carmel-based consultant for television, who wants to introduce students to the concept of career networking, which is "the normal way people in the industry get work."</p><p>Offered each winter quarter, the two-unit course typically meets for two hours on Friday afternoon to accommodate the schedules of guest speakers who fly in from Southern California and elsewhere. The class attracts aspiring writers, directors, producers, cinematographers, editors, and makeup artists.</p><p>Among the eight guest lecturers this year were Screen Gems executive vice president Jim Fredrick (B.A., theater arts, Porter College, 1982), PBS producer Eric Cain (B.A., anthropology, Merrill College, 1972), and producer Marie Cantin (B.A., sociology, Stevenson College, 1973).</p><p>During a fast-paced class in late February, Cantin gave students an overview of her career, industry trends, and a glimpse of the future. Of all the industry's job titles, producer is perhaps the most amorphous, explained Cantin, who works on studio and independent films, as well as the occasional television project.</p><p>"There are as many different roles for producer as there are people who do the job," said Cantin. "I get to do a lot of different things. I get to learn, make mistakes, and lead the charge. I like to do that."</p><p>Cantin, whose portfolio includes the films <i>The Waterdance</i>, <i>Book of Stars</i>, <i>Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead</i>, <i>Masked and Anonymous</i>, <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, <i>Collateral</i>, and <i>Dante's Peak</i>, said producers may be responsible for finding and developing material, raising money, funding projects, hiring directors, writers, cast members, and technicians, overseeing day-to-day operations on the set, and even marketing and distribution. </p><p>Cantin said she enjoys helping craft movies "from beginning to end" and that most of her knowledge has been gained on the job. But it hasn't always been easy, she cautioned. </p><p>After college, Cantin grappled with her interest in film, which wasn't an obvious fit. "I didn't grow up seeing a lot of movies. We didn't have a TV," she recalled. "I read. I read a lot." </p><p>In the end, said Cantin, the creative process comes down to what the artist wants to say. "What's your story? That to me is still the job and challenge of any artist," she reiterated after the class. "And that's where my excitement comes from. What are these people going to say, and how are they going to say it?"</p><p>Cantin said she considered law school ("I didn't want to go," she admitted), and when she finally told her father she wanted to work in movies, he said, "Move to LA." Cantin was working toward an M.F.A. in film and television production at UCLA when she landed her first job as a production assistant, so she left school and has patched together projects ever since.</p><p>Cantin didn't gloss over the financial uncertainty she has lived with as she pursues the work she enjoys, and she said this is a "very, very interesting and bizarre time in the industry. This is the slowest two years I've ever had."</p><p>Although traditional jobs are drying up, Cantin said new media is creating a "perfect storm" of opportunity. "The means to produce and distribute films is cheap, and you can figure it out yourself," she said, marveling at how much the landscape has changed during her 30-year career.</p><p>As the pendulum swings back from specialization to generalists who can write, shoot, direct, edit, and add sound effects to their own work, the challenge becomes building an audience, said Cantin, who also teaches in the graduate program of the American Film Institute. "Who sees the work? That's the conundrum, because there are so many platforms now," she said. "It's a total free for all. That's the beauty and horror of it all."</p><p>Cantin shared her guiding principles, or what she calls "my rules of engagement for my life," which include thinking outside the box, keeping a low overhead, allowing yourself 10 years to establish your career, and remembering that "today's assistant could be your boss tomorrow."</p><p>"Have faith in something other than your success, because it's not about that," she said. "It's about how you play the game. And vacations are mandatory."</p><p>As students applauded Cantin's presentation, Steck beamed, satisfied that his class had helped another group of students gear up to make the leap from college to career.  </p><p>"Hollywood is very different from the inside than it appears from the outside," said Steck. "Students who want to work in the industry should know what the reality is, to decide if they really want it and to better prepare for it if they do." </p><p>After class, Cantin said she loves talking to students and being a mentor. "Helping creative people figure out what their voice is--how to listen to that voice, how to make a living and survive, and how not to lose their way--that's my legacy," she said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b31428072704601a012fff18496a5"><name>2962</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>30 Grads in 30 Days: Nina McCurdy</title><summary>B.S., physics</summary><description>B.S., physics</description><start-date>1242630000000</start-date><display-name>30 Grads in 30...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2962</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2962</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338926859</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338926859</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/mccurdy_nina.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/mccurdy_nina.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mccurdy_nina.300.jpg</name><file-size>72335</file-size><width>300</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Nina McCurdy (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Name:</b> Nina McCurdy</p><p><b>Age:</b> 23</p><p><b>Major:</b> Applied physics</p><p><b>Hometown:</b> San Francisco</p><p><b>UCSC college:</b> Cowell</p><p><b>Favorite class or professor and why?</b></p><p>I would have to say that my favorite class was <i>Introduction to Modern Physics</i> (101B) with professor Bruce Schumm. This was really my first taste of quantum physics. The equations were beautiful, elegant, and powerful, and Professor Schumm took us from one to the next with such ease and grace. Schumm's lectures opened our eyes to an entirely new way of thinking about the world. </p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b> </p><p>It must have been the end of my freshman year. I was taking this multivariable calculus (123a) class taught by the brilliant and beloved Richard Mitchell. Not only is Mitchell a wonderful speaker, he is a master of the art of illustrating his lessons on the chalkboard. One day, we were all furiously taking notes on Gaussian surfaces and doing our very best to translate his beautiful depictions into our notebooks when mid-stroke, his piece of purple chalk reached the edge of the chalkboard. After only an instant of contemplating the situation, Mitchell lifted his chalk up and over the edge of the board and completed his illustration on the wall above. The class nearly lost it. What was, in actuality, a minor act of compensation was, at that moment, the most brilliant thing we had ever seen!</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>My favorite spot is probably at the top of the first incline on the bike path down from the Music Center. At the end of a long day on Science Hill, I hop on my bike and begin my journey home; around Kerr Hall, past the Media Theater, toward the Music Center, to the start of the bike path, up to the top of that first incline and before an utterly breathtaking view of the Monterey Bay. </p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>My time at UCSC has taught me not to believe in anything, whether it be a scientific theory, a social movement, or a way of life, to the extent where I can no longer reflect critically on it.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b> </p><p>The focus of my senior thesis was presenting concepts in physics to the general public through visual representation. I hope to pursue a career in this field. I am currently working for Professor Joel Primack, who is  committed to science outreach and to bringing his very high-resolution cosmological simulations to the general public. I am very grateful for this opportunity, and I am excited to see where this work takes me and what kind of opportunities arise from it.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>I'm pretty sure I chose Cowell because I thought that my mom had gone there back in the '70s. As it turns out, she was actually associated with Kresge. Whatever led me to Cowell, I am very happy that I ended up there. I really appreciated the fact that Cowell attracts people from all academic persuasions. And, as is the case for many people, the wonderful, smart, and talented friends I made my freshman year in those Cowell dorms are ones that I am determined to keep for a very long time. </p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b> </p><p>When I declared as a physics major, I didn't really believe that I would make it through the entire program. I figured that I would go as far as I could and then change paths when I couldn't take it anymore. So I guess I would have to say that receiving a B.S. in a subject that didn't necessarily come naturally to me in the beginning is my greatest accomplishment at UCSC. </p><p>Over the five years that I have been at UCSC, I've had the opportunity to work with some really wonderful professors. Last summer I helped Professor George Brown illustrate the lower division physics lab manuals. More recently, I created an animation aimed at presenting properties of quantum mechanics to the general public (with Professor Zack Schlesinger), as well as an interactive aimed at teaching the general public about gamma rays (with Professor David Williams) for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. I have also had the honor of being awarded the Ron Ruby Scholarship in 2008. </p><p>Lastly, I believe that anyone who manages to bike up to school, even on a semi-regular basis, should note it as an accomplishment.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b328d8072704601a012ffe67f7c88"><name>2963</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kuumbwa Jazz Center launches new half price series for students</title><summary>Beginning on June 11, the internationally recognized Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz will begin a new monthly half-price series for students. &#13;

I like the way that Lori teaches her class. She understands where students are coming from but also makes her classes challenging by having very high standards. She always begins her class the same way. During the first few minutes, she elicits news items from students and then comments on them. It is very interesting how she connects current events to economics, and ties the news to what we are reading about in class. She is one of those teachers who connects the course material to real life and uses her vast research knowledge to illustrate her point. If I were to take a class again at UCSC, I would make sure Lori was the professor.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>My most memorable experience happened recently when I was on a team for the first-ever Relay for Life at UCSC. Relay for Life is a 24-hour walk-a-thon that benefits cancer research. The event was completely student-run, and it was exciting to see the fruit of all the hard work of the students who put it together. I also enjoyed spending time with friends during the event.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>East Field. The view is amazing and there is always so much going on there. I usually go there to run or sometimes play a pickup game of soccer. It is never a bad idea to just go there and relax, especially at nighttime on a clear night.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>UCSC has given me the opportunity to get involved in so many aspects of students' experiences. Everyone at UCSC is very accessible, and students get the opportunity to make a difference. UCSC helped me branch out and discover new interests. I have come to realize that a small group of people can make a big difference, and I learned how to be dedicated to an idea and see it through to the end. Faculty, professors, administrators, and my friends at UCSC have shaped me in ways that will positively influence my actions for the rest of my life.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>My future plans are to get involved in high-tech marketing or sales. I also plan on staying connected to UCSC and the city because people here are really trying to make a difference, and I enjoy being part of that.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>I chose my college based on its location because it is within easy walking distance to most places on campus. College Ten is a community where people have a wide range of views, but a common passion to make a difference. Our core writing class definitely opened my eyes to new things, but it was the people at College Ten who truly affected my education.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>My greatest ongoing accomplishment was being president of the University Economics Association. At the completely student-run organization, I had the opportunity to put on many events that helped students make more of their education. Not only did I bring in some top companies like Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, Cisco, and Seagate, but also I got to help build an organizational structure that will continue to improve the education of students at UCSC.</p><p>I also founded the first-ever business plan competition at UC Santa Cruz, bringing together top executives from Silicon Valley and officials from the university and raising over $25,000 in funds and prize money. I've seen so much excitement about the competition from students and from the community, and I'm so excited to see all the businesses that are coming from it. Every year I know the competition will improve, and UCSC will one day be the face of technological, socially responsible, green entrepreneurship, and I'm grateful that I got to be part of that progression.</p><p><b>Ed. note:</b> Read more about the Business Plan Competition: <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3004">First-ever UC Santa Cruz Business Plan Competition generates winning ideas</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b352c8072704601a012ffd8a3062c"><name>2965</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC music grad student named winner in 57th Annual BMI Student Composer Awards</title><summary>UCSC graduate student in music Noah Gideon Meites is one of nine young classical composers who have been named winners in the 57th Annual BMI Student Composer Awards. </summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>music, BMI, graduate students, classical music, composers, creativity, scholarships, Music Department</keywords><description>UCSC graduate student in music Noah Gideon Meites is one of nine young classical composers who have been named winners in the 57th Annual BMI Student Composer Awards. </description><start-date>1242716400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC music grad student...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2965</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2965</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338927844</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338927844</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/noah_profile_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/noah_profile_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>noah_profile_250.jpg</name><file-size>40283</file-size><width>250</width><height>277</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>"Before I came to UC Santa Cruz, I thought that studying composition would just be an interesting thing to do," said Noah Meites (above).

"The award is validation for what I'm doing--that it's of value to people. It's inspiring."</p><p>Meites received his award for a composition titled <i>Bioskop</i>, for clarinet, violin, cello, piano and percussion. </p><p>His BMI award-winning work was recently premiered by the New Music Works ensemble under the direction of Phillip Collins at UCSC's 2009 "April in Santa Cruz Contemporary Music Festival."</p><p>Meites said the title of his composition comes from the name of one of the first film projectors invented in 1895 by German filmmaker Max Skladanowsky. "The piece was inspired by several of his short silent films," he noted.</p><p>In addition to working as a composer, Meites has also been active as a trumpet player and improviser. While studying in France, he founded an electro-jazz ensemble that performed in Poitiers and Paris. </p><p>In collaboration with Elvis Perkins, Meites has also performed on such stages as the <i>David Letterman Show</i>, Chicago's Lollapolooza Festival, and several venues in New York City. </p><p>But Meites said he is now completely focused on the art of composition.</p><p>"Before I came to UC Santa Cruz, I thought that studying composition would just be an interesting thing to do," said Meites.

I have taken four courses with Professor Guerra, and in every course I learned something new. The first course I took with her was <i>Introduction to Sociology;</i> it was in her course that I learned the value of people in a society and how every action can shape different things in life. Professor Guerra is a very motivational person. Since my freshman year, she has talked me through tough situations and taught me so many things that have opened my eyes to larger horizons. I know that in my future endeavors I will apply some lesson she has taught me.</p><p><b>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</b></p><p>My most memorable experience at UCSC is the night that President Barack Obama won candidacy. I remember being in my apartment with close friends waiting in anticipation for the final results. When it was finally official, I began to scream at the top of my lungs and then followed the tears. I went outside and there was a huge march taking place on campus. We walked and shared testimonies for hours--it was truly a memorable experience. It was definitely a landmark in my life because it was one of the first times I felt so proud to be an African American woman in the United States.</p><p><b>Favorite spot on campus and why?</b></p><p>The Oakes path. It is my favorite spot because I remember my sophomore year I was under a lot of stress, and not knowing where to turn. I went into the EOP office and had a conversation with the advisers, and on the way home, as I was walking down the Oakes path I heard a voice tell me that everything was going to be OK and that I would make it no matter what. At that moment I felt the sun shine on me. It was then I came to love the Oakes path. Whenever I feel down and out I go to the path to pour out my heart and wait for the sun to shine on me.</p><p><b>How has UCSC shaped you?</b></p><p>UCSC has helped me grow tremendously. I have learned to understand so many different backgrounds. I have learned to be a very independent and outspoken person. I have learned to fight for what I feel is right and hold on to my beliefs. The most important thing that UCSC has taught me is to always make it through. Coming to college without parents taught me discipline. I learned to always prioritize and be reliable.</p><p><b>What are your future plans?</b></p><p>I am currently applying for the master of arts in education teacher credential program at UCSC. I plan to become a history teacher back at home. I want to go back to my community and share knowledge that I got from college. I want to teach for a few years and later open up my own nonprofit geared toward former foster youth. As a former foster youth I had a very hard transition once I turned 18, and I want to be able to help youth in their own transition.</p><p><b>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</b></p><p>I chose Oakes College because of a student-initiated outreach program called Destination Higher Education. During this program I was able to learn and see the environment of the college. Oakes helped me to feel secure in college. I truly learned what community meant. I was reached out to as a freshman by many upperclassmen who shaped me to do the many things that I do today. As a senior at Oakes, I give back to the community still, hoping that I can help out underclassmen as I was helped out.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><p>At UCSC I have had the opportunity to work with many entities. I am a fourth-year member of the African/Black Student Alliance, where I have had the opportunity to be the student adviser and the publicity chair.

<p>There are "a lot of numbers flying around" about UC's budget cuts, said Chancellor George Blumenthal, addressing the last Academic Senate meeting of the year on Wednesday (May 21).</p>
<p>With the governor's May budget revision, Blumenthal said, a previous $115 million cut to the UC system has grown to $322 million. When combined with the state's underfunding of student enrollments and inflationary cost increases, UC's total budget gap would amount to $531 million.</p>
<p>The Legislature has yet to weigh in, and we "don't know the result, but let's be frank," said Blumenthal. "It's going to get harder, at least for the near future, and it's going to be a real challenge for everyone. Whether you are a student, faculty, or staff, you will feel it."</p>
<p>The total UCSC operating budget for 2008-09 is $540 million. The campus sustained two cuts this year - a $4.5 million permanent cut when the 2008-09 budget was allocated, then $6 million more as a one-time midyear cut. In recent weeks, campus officials have been making decisions about how to trim a collective $13 million in additional cuts for the 2009-10 year.</p>
<p>UCSC "won't be doing some of the things we used to, and now we're being cut even more," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>The campus is already beginning to see the impacts, said David Kliger, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. "The cost to students is rising dramatically, services are being reduced, jobs have been lost," he said.</p>
<p>The campus will accept fewer freshmen compared with last fall, but that's good news, said Blumenthal, because it will mitigate some of the impact of the cuts.</p>
<p>In assigning the cuts, "we attempted to evaluate what the impact of proposed cuts would be and assign the reductions in a way that imposed the least harm to our instruction and research mission," said Kliger.</p>
<p>He acknowledged he had received criticism for the way the cuts were conceived and implemented, and Kliger said he is consulting with the Senate's Committee on Planning &amp; Budget on future budget-cutting processes.</p>
<p>Of the $17.5 million in permanent reductions assigned for 2008 through 2010, academic support divisions have absorbed approximately two-thirds of the total ($11.4 million), and the academic divisions one-third ($5.5 million). The balance was taken from centrally held funds.</p>
<p>Kliger said the smaller differential cuts made in the most recent reductions to the Jack Baskin School of Engineering and the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences division were based on his belief that enrollments have historically shifted toward science and engineering during difficult economic times, so the campus might anticipate increased enrollments in these areas in the near future.</p>
<p>Also, he said, the federal government has made it clear that high priorities for investment in the coming years will be in the areas of health and energy independence.</p>
<p>"Engineering and PB Sci have strong programs in these areas and are in good positions to compete effectively for the increased federal funding that will be available to support their work in these areas with some investments," Kliger said.</p>
<p>He described the criteria he laid out for making various cuts, but said, "It is difficult for me to believe any decisions can truly be 'right' in this situation."</p>
<p>Principal officers have been asked to report on how they will implement the 2009-10 assigned reductions and identify the fund sources to be cut by May 22.</p>
<p>A student from Community Studies, one of many programs to lose staff and/or positions as part of the 2009-10 budget cut, asked whether high-level administrator salaries would be cut to help fill the budget gap.</p>
<p>Kliger said he'd proposed that to the UC Office of the President before and had been told it was "not the right time."</p>
<p>He noted that his office has taken the highest percentage of cuts compared with its overall budget.</p>
<p>"It's important you should know we are leading from the top and not just assuming all cuts have to be made at the bottom," he said.</p>
<p>Also at the meeting, the Committee on Faculty Welfare presented a report on the UC Retirement Program (UCRP), saying that liabilities now exceed assets by so much that even the planned 2010 restart of employee and employer contributions will not return the system to a healthy funding ratio. Health benefits for retirees are also in jeopardy, according to the report.</p>
<p>The senate passed a resolution urging UC President Yudof to issue and post on the Office of the President's web site statements assuring UC's commitment to honor UCRP employee benefits and post-retirement health benefits and provide financial reports and information.</p>

The latest triumph occurred this afternoon when the Slugs defeated Amherst College 5-0. The 2009 NCAA Division III championships were played at Claremont College in Southern California.</p>
<p>UCSC led 3-0 after the three doubles matches were completed, and they played their way to a 5-0 sweep with victories in the No. 1 and 5 singles matches. With a national championship clinched, the remaining four singles matches still in progress were suspended, though UCSC led in every one of them.</p>

They wanted their daughter, Charlie, to make her own decision.</p><p>They made a trip to the East Coast to visit schools like Sarah Lawrence, New York University, Boston College, and Hampshire. They toured Mills College, which had offered Charlie a generous scholarship. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Nelsons were "absolutely thrilled" when Charlie picked UCSC, said Dency. </p><p>"It looked like it was going to be Mills," he recalled. But something clicked during a spur-of-the-moment return visit to UCSC last April. </p><p>"We got to campus and there were kids everywhere, and there was just this energy," he said. "Charlie turned to me and said, 'This feels like the right place for me.' From that point on, it was UCSC."</p><p>The Nelsons, of Hermosa Beach, are two of about 240 alumni parents of current students, according to Frankie Melvin, associate director of colleges and parents programs at UCSC. Dency (B.A., theater arts, Porter College, 1974) is a stage manager for television, while Moira (B.A., literature, Cowell College, 1974) is a freelance textbook developer. </p><p>"We were really trying to be careful not to tip it, but UCSC is a good place for Charlie," said Dency. "It fits her social sensibility. She really is a 21st-century version of us in the '60s."</p><p>For her part, Charlie appreciates that her parents didn't pressure her during the decision-making process. "I think I picked UCSC almost in spite of them, in a way," she said.</p><p>"I love living here," said Charlie, who is wrapping up her freshman year. "The school is incredible. I think it's incredibly underestimated academically." </p><p>Charlie, a dancer, chose Stevenson College because she was drawn to the core course, <i>Self and Society;</i> the two-quarter class was a highlight of her year. "The core course is the essence of a liberal arts education, and it's a really special part of Santa Cruz," she said.</p><p>Another highlight was co-directing "Random With a Purpose," an annual showcase of student choreography and dance. "You can't necessarily do that as a freshman at NYU," said Moira. "I think people underestimate what UCSC can offer in terms of opportunity and support, not to mention the excellence of the institution and faculty."</p><p>For the Nelsons, having their daughter attend UCSC has deepened their connection to the campus. As members of the recently formed Parents Council, the Nelsons are enthusiastic supporters of UCSC. </p><p>"The values that drew us to UCSC were nurtured and reinforced at UCSC," said Dency. "We wanted to make sure the place we loved was still there, and we realized it's up to us to help keep it alive. We want Charlie to have the experience we did. UCSC is a place to think, to broaden your horizons. To pursue your passions." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b47338072704601a012ffc2eaa248"><name>2973</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC grad student to present digital arts project on forced marriage at Santa Cruz museum</title><summary>Nada Miljkovic knows a lot about forced marriages.

<p>"In the Balkans," says Nada Miljkovic, a 43-year-old graduate student in the UCSC Digital Arts and New Media program (DANM), "sevdah is a tradition sung by those forced into marriage in an extremely patriarchal society, a culture that objectifies women as a commodity."</p>
<p>Miljkovic knows a lot about forced marriages. In fact, she's a child of one.</p>
<p>That experience has led to a thesis project titled "Balkan Song," a multi-channel video installation, performance piece, and social networking site that will be featured at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, beginning on May 29 and running through June 24.</p>
<p>Her project is one of several student works that will be presented during the second phase of the UCSC DANM program's "InterACTIVATE" exhibition.</p>
<p>Miljkovic's installation includes a remarkable short film, <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/~nada/Podcasts/evaonmarriage.mp4"><em>Eva on Marriage,</em></a> in which her 10-year-old daughter muses about the idea of marriage. The film recently screened at the 2009 Santa Cruz Film Festival.</p>
<p>Her exhibit also includes videos depicting forced marriage from the point of view of her father ("It was my choice, I don't look back"), her mother ("I was in love with another man, but forced to marry"), and herself ("I grew up thinking subconsciously that marriage is when a man buys a woman.")</p>
<p>Miljkovic made her first film in 2007, a feature length work called <em>Two Villages One Heart,</em> about how the town of Ben Lomond--where she now lives in the Santa Cruz mountains--is similar to her ancestral village in Serbia. The film was inspired by her reaction to the media's portrayal of life in Yugoslavia during the recent Balkan conflict.</p>
<p>"After the bombing in Yugoslavia where my family was living, I wanted to do something to counter the media demonizing part of my identity," says Miljkovic. "I made the film as a way of showing my friends here what my relatives were like in Yugoslavia, and showing my relatives what my family was like here. They have a great deal in common."</p>
<p>Born in Belgrade, Miljkovic moved to the Chicago area to attend Purdue University, where she a earned a B.S. in construction management and a B.A. in philosophy. After graduation, she moved to California and worked as highway inspector for Caltrans and also for the Bay Area's BART Extension program.</p>
<p>In 1995, Miljkovic moved to Ben Lomond and began working locally as a civil engineer. She applied to UCSC's new graduate program in digital arts and new media after an inspiring conversation with DANM program manager Felicia Rice.</p>
<p>"Computer science, film and digital media, art, philosophy.when I met with Felicia and she explained what the program was all about, I thought it was so like me!" recalls Miljkovic.</p>
<p>"DANM is a very ambitious program; it's been a very intense two years," she adds. "They are pushing us to articulate the very newest contemporary art theory, and showing us how to describe our work and write about it. They're teaching us how to do what it takes to be an artist in today's art world-how to put on an exhibition, to curate, and to do public relations."</p>
<p>Miljkovic says she loves to experiment using different forms of digital media, and she is particularly interested in seeing the effect of art on web sites.</p>
<p>"The whole idea that art can be a dialogue was something I felt intuitively, but didn't have a handle on until now," Miljkovic notes. "It's about having the opportunity to change someone's mind--and affect them emotionally--in hopefully a better way."</p>

The celebration was held at Stevenson Event Center and attended by nearly 130 veteran and non-veteran students, military officials, community leaders, campus representatives, and others.</p><p>UCSC has the largest per capita population of veterans of any UC campus, said Wilson, who is president of the UCSC chapter of Student Veterans of America. The campus expects approximately 100 veterans to be among its 16,000 students this fall.</p><p>In April, the American Council on Education and the Wal-Mart Foundation <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2883">awarded UCSC a $100,000 grant</a> to support its veterans' programs.</p><p>"The veterans here love UCSC, and don't like the fact that the campus in some regards has the reputation of not being a veteran-friendly university," said Wilson, who transferred from San Jose City College and is now a junior majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology. "We felt it would be a good idea to take advantage of the opportunity right now with the political climate changes and the student body maybe being more supportive of veterans than they had in past, and move forward with the idea that we could build something out of this." </p><p>Their goals were to raise awareness of UCSC as a veteran-friendly campus, demonstrate the diversity of the campus's veteran group, and provide information about the resources available to veterans.</p><p>Mary Hayes, 33, a National Guard member who transferred to UCSC from Hartnell College, said she's gotten a good reception on campus. </p><p>"I was a little nervous about letting people know that I'm in the service, but I've gotten positive responses from both students and faculty," said Hayes, a psychology major and mother to three children ages 13, 9, and 2.  </p><p>Wednesday's ceremony included a color guard, the Presidio of Monterey Air Force choir, a speech by Colonel Bucky Peterson of <a href="http://www.troopstocollege.ca.gov/ ">Troops to College</a>, and a keynote address by retired U.S. Navy Captain Gordon R. Nakagawa, a Vietnam veteran and POW.</p><p>"What you're doing on this campus is a tremendous tribute to fallen heroes," Peterson said in his remarks to the audience. In holding such a ceremony, he said, "this university is rising as a model, not just for California, but for the nation." </p><p>UCSC is "probably one of the most epic schools to host this event because of the perception of it being anti-war," said veteran and Cabrillo College student Tom Marrs, who helped organize the UCSC event and plans to start a Student Veterans of America chapter at Cabrillo. </p><p>Just being at such an event was a moving experience, said Marrs, 27, who served eight years in the Army and was sent on three deployments to the Middle East. </p><p>"Everyone who's worn the uniform has so much in common, so it's a great feeling to sit down with other vets," Marrs said. "It's a brotherhood you can't explain." </p><p>For Lawrence Reeves, who is affiliated with the Naval Postgraduate School Foundation, the celebration felt historic. </p><p>"We've never had this number of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and the other conflicts going on, and they're using the GI Bill to go to college," he said, pointing out that veterans from past wars did the same thing and formed the basis of the country's middle class. </p><p>In fact, he said, some of UCSC's founding pioneers were veterans, including <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/07-22/history.html">Hal Hyde</a>, vice chancellor of business and finance from 1964-1975. </p><p>Hyde, who was out of the country and could not attend the Memorial Day ceremony at UCSC, served in infantry combat with the Army in Europe during World War II and retired from the reserves as a Major General.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b4c5b8072704601a012ff071208fe"><name>2975</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>xxx</title><summary>xxx</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>rabkin, writing, environmental studies, class, undergraduate, education, instruction, communication</keywords><description>xxx</description><start-date>1243753200000</start-date><display-name>xxx...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2975</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2975</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338933783</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338933783</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/rabkin.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/rabkin.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rabkin.300.jpg</name><file-size>64240</file-size><width>300</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sarah Rabkin, front, teaches a popular writing class offered by Environmental Studies.

These expected cuts come in the wake of $17.5 million in permanent cuts to UCSC since 2008.</p><p>We now confront a series of even more difficult choices, just as we prepare to absorb $13 million in funding cuts and mandatory cost increases taking effect this July 1.</p><p>Additional cuts of the magnitude being proposed at the state level would further impact access to classes and class sizes, and other vital student services.</p><p>We are now consulting with campus and Academic Senate leaders, and others, to develop a process for absorbing further cuts. While no one can anticipate how (or how quickly) the budget process in Sacramento will play out, we promise to share what we know when we know it.</p><p>In coming days and weeks, a wide range of budget-cutting proposals -- some real and some speculative -- will circulate in the news media and elsewhere. Already, we have seen a proposal to eliminate Cal Grant funding, which would profoundly impact over 4,000 UCSC students and their families. This would be especially troubling for a campus uncommonly committed to undergraduate education and serving an unusually high proportion of first-generation college students and students from low-income families.</p><p>We are tracking all scenarios being discussed at the state level, and will work to communicate to the Office of the President and state lawmakers the impact that additional budget reductions would have on our campus.</p><p>This is the time of year when we honor the achievements of graduating students and the faculty and staff who have so ably served them. We do look forward to seeing you at one or more of the many upcoming ceremonies and events celebrating those achievements.

In conjunction with other transportation information, the results of the Commuter Survey will help campus planners monitor the effectiveness of existing programs and services.</p><p> </p><p>Your responses also help gauge the factors that encourage or inhibit use of sustainable transportation alternatives, while a "Comments" area provides an opportunity to share your ideas, suggestions and feedback. By comparing these results with similar surveys conducted over the past ten years, certain trends-such as growing support for "green" travel choices-can be analyzed and documented. Ultimately, these findings will help TAPS provide new, improved, and expanded programs and services to the campus community. To that end, both the Campus Welfare Committee and Transportation Advisory Committee invite your participation.</p><p> </p><p>Those who complete the survey no later than Friday, May 29th, may enter their name and contact information to win one of five $50 gift certificates to the Bay Tree Bookstore.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you in advance for your participation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>TAPS Director Larry Pageler, Transportation Advisory Committee Chair; Assistant Chancellor Ashish Sahni, Campus Welfare Committee Chair</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b56858072704601a012fff6fba1ea"><name>2982</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Iconic' cooperage being reinforced to preserve history</title><summary>The cooperage, one of the historic buildings in the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, is undergoing temporary reinforcement to keep it standing as time takes its toll on the structure.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>cooperage, Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District</keywords><description>The cooperage, one of the historic buildings in the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, is undergoing temporary reinforcement to keep it standing as time takes its toll on the structure.</description><start-date>1243580400000</start-date><display-name>'Iconic' cooperage being reinforced...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2982</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2982</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338936392</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338936392</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/cooperage.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/cooperage.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cooperage.300.jpg</name><file-size>54886</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The cooperage is being shored up to keep it standing.

<p>The historic building near the base of campus--on the left as you pass the Cook House just past the main entrance--is undergoing temporary reinforcement to keep it standing as time takes its toll on the structure, according to Damon Adlao, project manager with Physical Planning and Construction.</p>
<p>The project, which will cost about $60,000, is being supported in part with private donations raised by the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2545">Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a>, including a $25,000 President's Emergency Grant from the S.H. Cowell Foundation, whose funds originally came in part from the lime works operated by Henry Cowell at the campus site. Friends volunteers also are working to restore a historic workers' cabin and other structures on the the site with assistance from the local and state Cabrillo Civic Clubs of California and donations from Big Creek Lumber Company.</p>
<p>"The problem with the cooperage is the existing foundations were made from old quarry rock from here on site, and the entire building is up on eight-foot-tall pillars," said Adlao, a UCSC alumnus (Porter, '94). "Those are starting to fail--they're close to 150 years old, and the entire building is starting to shift. It's something that's been getting worse and worse every year, and from everyone's calculations, it wasn't going to last very long. So we're doing an emergency triage, so to speak, to hold the building up."</p>
<p>The Cowell Lime Works District--an area of 30 acres near the base of campus that is on the National Register of Historic Places--includes four lime kilns, the cooperage (where barrels were made), the hay barn, cook house, lime worker cabins, Cardiff house, and many other historic structures.</p>
<p>In the 1850s and '60s, the area was the center of the largest lime manufacturing area in California. As a vital building material, lime played a key role in the development of California cities after the Gold Rush.</p>
<p>In addition to holding the building up, the temporary shoring of the cooperage will also make it safe for volunteers and campus staff to go inside it to assess its structural integrity as well as its contents.</p>
<p>"Once we make that assessment, we'll have an understanding of what's next," Adlao said.</p>
<p>The Friends group and Physical Planning and Construction hope to get funding to rehabilitate the entire cooperage site, said Adlao.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're just getting it safe and shoring it up so we don't lose it," Adlao said. "It's an iconic resource."</p>
<p>As an alumnus, working on the cooperage project has extra layer of meaning for Adlao.</p>
<p>"And people I've talked to, other alumni, agree it lends a certain character to UCSC--without it, there would be something lost," Adlao said. "It has almost as much power as the main sign as far as an entry sequence on the campus."</p>
<p>In other news, the Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District recently received a certificate of appreciation from the Santa Cruz Historic Preservation Commission for contributing to the city's history through its grassroots organization dedicated to the study and rehabilitation of the Cowell Lime Works.</p>

"I always loved math and science," she said. "Every time I had to write a paper, I had a breakdown. Now it's become easier."</p><p>Under the unfailingly supportive tutelage of Rabkin, whose teaching formula combines access, extensive feedback, and firm deadlines, Pearl and her 25 classmates overcame doubts and surprised themselves with what they produced.</p><p>From short radio pieces to lengthy literary essays, course assignments challenged students on many levels. For many, the class was the first time they'd been asked to think deeply and write from their own perspective.</p><p>"More than anything, this class has given me an opportunity to explore my own opinions," said Audrey Fry, who is majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology and environmental studies. "It's helping me figure out what I believe in. I've been doing some serious soul searching."</p><p>The class gave Pearl an opportunity to grapple with her discontent with traditional economic theory, which she explored in a literary essay about her family history. For Fry, the class brought together two compelling interests: She decided during high school that she wanted to study biology but felt torn when a favorite English teacher encouraged her to write. "As a freshman, I saw this class, which looked like the perfect synthesis of both my interests. I've been looking forward to it for several years," she said.</p><p>The rigorous class is structured to help students break bad habits, like dashing off superficial writing. Rabkin requires students to revise each draft multiple times, and each is returned covered with comments, questions, and requests--for more precise language, more compelling imagery, more heartfelt reflection. The result is a deeper level of engagement with the material than many have ever experienced.</p><p>"Literary analysis is like walking with crutches, because you're walking along on the shoulders of what others have said," explained Heather Griffith, who is pursuing a combined major in environmental studies and biology with a minor in literature. "I'm used to the formula, and I can whip it out. In this class, you have to do more thinking." </p><p>Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and chair of the department, is a big fan of the class, which he co-taught with Rabkin for several years. "I learned an incredible amount," he recalled, adding that he would offer 10 sections of the class and require it of all majors, if there were funds to do so. "We have a very writing-intensive major anyway," he noted.</p><p>UCSC faculty recently endorsed an enhancement of writing instruction on campus. A <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2749">new graduation requirement</a> will ensure that all students receive high-level instruction tailored to their field of study. Rabkin, who has taught writing at UCSC since 1985, believes writing is an essential life skill that prepares students "as citizens, members of a democracy, change agents, and human beings."</p><p>"Learning to write is learning to think," she said, adding that her class builds on the foundation students get through lower-division classes offered by the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/writingprogram/">Writing Program</a>. "By the time students get to my class, though, they are by no means finished learning to understand and develop arguments, how to communicate a position, how to support a position, and how to articulate what they think about an issue. Writing develops intellectual fluency."</p><p>Rabkin's students described her as "approachable," "down to earth," "encouraging," "helpful," and "easy to talk to." "She insists that you work at something until it's right. She demands that time and dedication," said one.</p><p>For her part, Rabkin described teaching assistant Sarah Carvill (B.A. environmental studies, College Ten, 2007) as one of the best writing instructors she's ever encountered. Carvill earned her master's degree in environmental studies from the University of Montana this spring and will begin the UCSC doctoral program in environmental studies this fall. She was an affable role model for aspiring writers in the class, because she discovered her own passion for writing when she took the class as an undergraduate.</p><p>The course's emphasis on environmental action through writing is particularly apt for students in environmental studies, many of whom struggle with feelings of hopelessness about the state of the planet. Writing can be a tool for social change, they learn, and Rabkin's assignments encourage students to engage in public debate. After writing 90-second opinion pieces for radio, many recorded their spots for broadcast on KUSP Radio's <a href=" http://www.kusp.org/firstperson/index.html">"First Person Singular"</a> program.</p><p>And Fry had an <a href=" http://www.petaluma360.com/article/20090513/COMMUNITY/905139887">opinion piece</a> published in her hometown paper. It takes work to formulate one's own opinions and courage to share them in a public forum, said Fry, who wrote against a proposal to build an asphalt plant near a unique wetland--and wasn't dissuaded by the attacks that inevitably followed the publication of her piece.</p><p>"If you're willing to put yourself out there, people will listen to what you have to say," she said. "It's good to have that push, that encouragement. Now that I've done it, it's not so hard. I will continue to do it."</p><p>Mike Vais, a junior majoring in environmental studies, scored a major success with a persuasive-writing assignment that morphed into a full-fledged campaign to encourage students to walk instead of ride campus shuttles or city buses. Vais had planned to make flyers to publicize his "Slugs with Feet" campaign but opted instead to create a Facebook group, which took off like the proverbial wildfire.</p><p>"The amount of support is just amazing," said Vais. "I didn't see it coming." The response has been encouraging for Vais, who said he has felt a lot of internal conflict "because we're all complicit in this environmental crisis because of our way of life."</p><p>Rabkin's class has been transformative, said Vais. "Writing has helped me connect my own thoughts to the rest of the world," he said. "I was feeling really bummed out, but working hard at a piece of writing alongside other motivated students was very empowering. My parents are thrilled to see me becoming a self-motivated, passionate individual. They've been waiting for me to spread my wings."</p><p>Inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh, author of <i>The World We Have</i>, Vais sums up his experience in Rabkin's class by saying, "The thing about this class is it's not so much what's provided by the teacher as what you encounter on your own."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915b5cfa8072704601a012ff294573ab"><name>2986</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergrad chosen for prestigious research internship in Japan</title><summary>UCSC undergraduate Dominic Papia has been selected for a prestigious summer internship at one of Japan's premier research centers.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>James Gill</keywords><description>UCSC undergraduate Dominic Papia has been selected for a prestigious summer internship at one of Japan's premier research centers.</description><start-date>1243580400000</start-date><display-name>Undergrad chosen for prestigious...</display-name><path>/2009/05/2986</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/05/2986</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338938055</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338938055</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/05/images/papia_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/05/images/papia_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>papia_200.jpg</name><file-size>51854</file-size><width>200</width><height>230</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Dominic Papia.

According to James Gill, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, the ISEI laboratories are among the best in the world in these fields. </p><p>Papia, a junior with a combined major in environmental studies and Earth and planetary sciences, is currently enrolled in Gill's course on magmas and volcanoes. Gill told his students about the internship at the beginning of the quarter, and Papia decided to apply.</p><p>"I've always wanted to go to Japan," he said. "I'm looking forward to the cultural experience as well as the research experience."</p><p>Papia will spend six weeks in Misasa, a hot springs resort town, conducting research at ISEI in the area of geochemistry and geochronology. When he returns to UCSC for his senior year, Papia hopes to work with Gill on a senior thesis project that builds on his internship experience. Beyond that, he is considering going to graduate school to study igneous petrology (rocks of volcanic origin).</p><p>Papia credits Gill's course with sparking his interest in Earth sciences research.

<p>UC Santa Cruz has a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2991">2008-09 operating budget</a> of approximately $540 million. Of that $190 million comes from the State of California. These State funds, when combined with the educational fee and nonresident tuition and a portion of the campus's overhead receipts, comprise the general (or core) funds that are used to support instruction, research, library, admissions, registrar, financial aid offices, maintenance of State-funded facilities, and an array of administrative and health and safety services.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz's permanent cut in 2008-09 was $4.5 million. The campus also received a one-time, mid-year cut of $6 million, the majority of which was absorbed from campus central reserves.</p>
<p>The 2009-10 State budget-signed by the Governor on February 20, 2009-reduces UC's State funding by $115 million. The University expects that these budget cuts will be permanent.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's share of this $115 million permanent reduction is about $7 million. In addition, the budget contains no funding for mandatory cost increases for employee compensation, benefits, utilities and building maintenance. These unfunded cost increases total at least $6 million, bringing UCSC's total budget shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year to $13 million.</p>

<p>The Campus Provost provided one-time funds to address the 2008-09 mid-year cuts. He asked principal officers to implement all reasonable cost-saving measures and to engage their staffs in identifying creative ways to invest limited resources as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>For 2009-10, the <a href="Docs/2009-10FinalBudgetReduction.pdf">$13 million reduction</a> is being allocated to:</p>

<p>Each principal officer has been assigned a target (effective July 1, 2009) and was delegated authority to implement the cuts within a number of broad parameters.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz has restructured information technology services, centralized most business and human resource functions, and invested in technology to automate labor- and paper-intensive activities. The campus has implemented energy and water conservation projects that are expected to help control future utility costs.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude of the cuts, the Campus Provost has recently established workgroups to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of existing instructional and academic advising activities.</p>

<p><a id="Will_enrollments_be_impacted" name="Will_enrollments_be_impacted" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#285991">Will enrollments be impacted?</font></a></p>
<p>Despite increasing student demand, both UC and the Santa Cruz campus has restricted the number of new California resident freshmen enrollments in 2009-10.  For UC Santa Cruz, the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/regmeet/jan09/j1.pdf">recent Regental action</a> translates into a 335 decrease (over 2008-09) in the size of our freshman class. This decision to curtail enrollments is a difficult one for UC and for the Santa Cruz campus given our commitment to providing access to UC-eligible California resident applicants under California's Master Plan for Higher Education.</p>

<p>State funding for construction comes from either General Obligation Bonds or from Lease Revenue Bonds services, neither of which can be used for any purpose other than the projects for which they were approved.  In particular, such funds cannot be used to mitigate the cuts, avoid layoffs, or address other programmatic issues related to the operating budget.</p>
<p>The 18-month budget signed by the Governor in February did not include funding for the University's 2009-10 capital program and, because of the State's fiscal condition, funding for many of our existing State-funded capital projects has been suspended.</p>

Will there be layoffs? Furloughs? Pay cuts? Will there be an incentive program for early retirement?</font></a></p>
<p>All principal officers have been encouraged to fill only essential positions. Further, the campus initiated a number of cash-conserving actions (e.g., leaving unfilled positions open, curtailing non-essential travel, deferring equipment purchases, etc.) and has implemented the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/start/program.htm">START program</a>, which allows voluntary reductions in time.</p>
<p>It is likely that there will be layoffs. The campus will provide outplacement services to employees who receive a layoff notice. For information about the transition support, please see the Staff Human Resources <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/layoff-res_mgr-sup/ch-16.htm">website</a>.</p>
<p>UC President Yudof has commissioned a contingency plan for the possibility of employee furloughs and/or salary reductions. The President's goal is to produce for consideration by The Regents a broad framework for both systemwide and campus-by-campus furloughs and salary reductions, if they become necessary.</p>
<p>At this point there are no plans for an early retirement program.</p>

<p>As of this writing, we anticipate that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faculty will continue to receive merit increases as per UC policy, but there will be no general increase;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Non-represented staff will not receive general or merit increases; and<br/>
<br/>

<li>Union-represented employees subject to collective bargaining will receive their negotiated salary increases.</li>

<p>The UC Regents approved an overall plan to resume both employer and employee contributions to the UC Retirement System (UCRS) in 2009-10.</p>
<p>The State contribution for this resumption of employer contributions to UCRS was not in the budget adopted in February 2009. UC continues to work with the Department of Finance and the Legislature about resuming such State contributions-as it does for other State employees. Thus, both the timing and the amount of those contributions have not yet been determined by the Regents.</p>

<p><a id="Will_student_fees_increase" name="Will_student_fees_increase" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#285991">Will student fees increase?</font></a></p>
<p>The November 2008 Regents budget proposed a 9.4% increase in mandatory systemwide student fees. Regents are expected to take action on student fees at their May 2009 meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to its already robust student financial aid, the Regents adopted a new Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan that ensures all students with financial need and annual household incomes under $60,000 will have 100% of their fees covered.</p>

<p>Registration fees will continue to be used to support student services, although the campus is no longer in a position to subsidize student programs with core funds. The revenues from campus-based mandatory fees will be used consistent with the terms of the referendum.</p>
<p>If the mandatory costs exceed available revenues, student fee-funded programs will experience programmatic reductions.</p>

<p>Private giving does not substitute directly for on-going core funds like State general funds or student fees. Donors tend to be interested in specific targets for excellences and their gifts are typically one-time investments.</p>
<p>The use of research funds are specified in the contracts under which they are awarded. While they can't be used to replace cuts in State support for academic programs they play an absolutely critical role in UCSC's mission, for example, they support our graduate students and provide summer salary for our faculty who contribute to the research specified in these contracts.</p>

<p>Chancellor Blumenthal and campus government relations staff are meeting regularly with local legislators about these issues and their impact on the campus.

<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of ten University of California campuses and has a 2008-09 operating budget of approximately $540 million.  These funds come from many sources.</p>
<p>Of this, approximately $290 million are considered general (or core) funds.  These funds are derived primarily from the State, the educational fee and nonresident tuition paid by students, and a portion of the campus's overhead receipts. They are used to support instruction, research, the library, admission, registration, and financial aid offices, maintenance of state-funded facilities, and an array of administrative and protective services. These are funds that are expected to continue from year to year to support the ongoing activities of the campus. They are permanently budgeted funds and they are the primary source of funding for our faculty positions, staff salaries, and our core operations.</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">Major UCSC divisions/departments-their responsibilities and base budgets</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UCSC has five academic divisions (Arts, Humanities, Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and a School of Engineering), business and administrative services, student support activities, academic and residential colleges, and an assortment of other academic and institutional support activities such as the university library, university relations, and information technology services.</p>
<p>Some areas are funded primarily with general core funds (State general funds, educational fee revenue, and a portion of overhead receipts).  Other areas are supported with student fees (registration fees, campus based fees, miscellaneous fees) and some areas are largely self-supporting or supported by recharge income. The following illustrates the different funding patterns for some of our major units.</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">Resources coming to the Santa Cruz campus</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Resources come to UCSC from many sources - referred to as revenue streams. The five main revenue streams that support the UCSC operating budget are derived from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2995">State of California</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2996">Student fees</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2997">Federal government</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2998">Private sources</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/article.asp?pid=2999">Auxiliary enterprises and other fund sources</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3><font color="#285991">Trends in State resources coming to the University of California system</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The funds the University receives from the State represent the largest single fund source providing the vital core support for the University's core mission programs of teaching, research, and public service.  These funds do not flow directly from the State to UCSC, but are allocated by UCOP using either a programmatic or formulaic approach that is intended to direct funds consistent with the plan approved by The Regents and discussed with the State.</p>
<p>The amount of State support that UC receives has been declining steady. Since 1990-91, the State's share of average inflation-adjusted expenditures for educating UC students has declined by 40%. Over this period, student fees have helped to make up for the declines in State support, and as a result, the student share (net of financial aid) has more than doubled. Student fees now pay for about 31% of the costs of attending UC, up from 13%.</p>

<p>While University funding from the State in real dollars has tripled since 1980-81, the University's share of the total State General Fund budget has declined markedly over the long term. In the late 1980s, more than 5% of the State General Fund was dedicated to UC; by 2008-09, the UC share had declined to 3.2%.</p>

Like all divisions on campus, the University Library has been informed of an impending cut for the fiscal 2009-2010 year. Taken in combination with the 3.2% permanent cut received this year (FY08-09) that impacted library operations and staffing, the upcoming 9.99% cut to the library's overall budget means the Collection Budget can no longer be exempted and will be affected by the new reduced, permanent budget of the Library. Your attention will be needed at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2009 as we implement reductions in our collections, and this memo provides information about the process we are undertaking and the timeline that will be followed.</p>
<p>For the last five years, the Library's collection budget has remained fairly flat. The few small increases received to augment the collections budget have not been sufficient to keep up with the rising costs of electronic resources, industry inflation rates, and the increasing demand for digital resources, and we have had to make changes in our subscriptions on an annual basis. While we continue to purchase books, it is important to understand that over the last ten years, an increasing portion of the University Library's budget has been dedicated to acquiring access to digital resources including electronic journals, e-books, databases, and reference &amp; instructional materials to meet the "anywhere, anytime" access that faculty and students desire. Providing access to these licensed resources -- approximately 23,000 titles -- now comprises a majority of our collections budget.</p>
<p>In acquiring these digital resources, we have worked with our UC peers and have leveraged the licensing power of the California Digital Library (CDL) to invest in a far greater number of resources than we would have been able to license on our own. For example, our cost share of the recent UC-Elsevier deal provides UCSC faculty and students with access to 1411 journal titles. If purchased separately by UCSC, we would have been able to afford fewer than 120 of those titles for the same amount of money invested. We will continue to work with CDL and our UC peers to obtain consortial discounts on licensed resources, but it is important to realize that while CDL provides assistance with the various journal and database packages licensed, it is the UCSC Library's collection budget that pays the annual cost for the resources, not CDL. When the Library's collection budget faces large cuts, subscriptions to electronic resources -- especially those that are not part of large CDL packages -- will inevitably be affected.</p>
<p>During previous budget cuts, the Library followed the prudent course of eliminating duplicative print subscriptions as well as eliminating print versions of journals we receive electronically, where possible. With the exception of a few titles recently moved into subscription packages, we have exhausted this option as a budget reduction mechanism. We have also worked quickly to realize savings from locally licensed titles and have carefully considered all new licensing commitments to stay as flexible as possible during tight budgetary times. Nevertheless, the 9.99% cut to the library's overall budget will mean a $780,000 permanent cut to the collection budget; even these cost saving measures are incapable of covering a cut of this magnitude.</p>
<p>To meet the annual budget approved by the Executive Vice Chancellor, the Library has moved forward to address the collections budget shortfall. We have begun a serials review project to gather and analyze information about the serials resources to which we subscribe. Data such as overall cost, cost per use, inflation rates, publishing metrics (Impact Factor, Eigen Factor, etc.), subject areas, coverage provided by other journals to which we already subscribe, and UCSC faculty publishing patterns are being gathered to help the Library evaluate the resources we acquire and/or license. The goal of this serials review process is to identify a set of titles that will be cancelled to meet the reduced collections budget. Please note: we plan to continue interlibrary loan services and will be able to acquire individual articles on an as-needed basis from cancelled titles.</p>
<p>As a part of this project, over the summer the Library will establish a website to communicate with faculty members about the project status as well as all other information developed to support this serials review. We will make available lists of locally subscribed titles identified for cancellation, as well a list of all journal titles we receive (not available for cancellation) so that faculty members can see the context of all titles received in a certain subject area. The ideal time to finish this project and get information to our vendors in order to make subscription changes effective on January 1, 2010 is during the summer. However, since we know that many faculty members will be away during this crucial time, we have worked with our vendors to obtain additional time and will instead make the information available to you during the month of September. That will allow a few weeks for faculty to comment and ask questions about titles identified for cancellation.</p>
<p>Your subject specialist has more detailed information about this process; a list of subject specialist names is at <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/infonotes/Coll.html">http://library.ucsc.edu/infonotes/Coll.html</a>. Your input in September will be important in further informing the Library about titles of value to faculty members while allowing the library to meet our mandatory reductions in subscription costs.</p>
<p>All of us who work in the library are aware of the serious impacts these cancellations will have on faculty and others in the campus community. We will continue to do everything we can within the constraints of our budget to provide faculty, students, and staff with the resources and services needed for instruction and research. I regret that the economic climate necessitates these reductions.

<p><em><strong>State General Funds</strong></em>. A significant portion (35%) of the UCSC's budget comes from the state general budget.  Funds are allocated (or reduced) on an incremental basis.  Permanent funds are budgeted and are included in the base budget. Incremental funds are allocated by the campus through the budget process.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<p align="center"><img border="0" height="146" src="Images/StateAsPctofUCSC.jpg" width="441"/></p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>In the current year, the campus reduced its budget by $10.5 million. This includes $4.5 million in permanent reductions and an additional $6 million in additional one-time mid-year cuts that resulted from the 18-month budget signed by the Governor on February 20, 2009.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>The following describes other key funding categories from the state and their uses.  It should be noted, however, that the State does not provide the university with funding increases in each of these categories every year.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em><strong>State contracts and grants</strong></em>. These funds, awarded to faculty, must be used according to the terms and conditions of the individual award. These funds are not budgeted and are not part of the campus's allocation process.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong><em>Special State Funds</em></strong>. Usually voter-approved and earmarked funds, i.e. Cigarette Tax, Breast Cancer Research Fund, State Lottery Funds, State Transportation funds.  The use of these funds is restricted, and do not come directly to the campus.</p>

<p><em><strong>Educational Fee (Ed Fee)</strong></em> - This is a system wide mandatory fee.  These funds do not come directly to UCSC; they are allocated by UCOP based on actual enrollment levels.  The amount allocated to UCSC is adjusted (reduced) to pay for financial aid (up to one-third of the Educational and Registration Fee revenue is directed to need-based financial aid.  Although this is calculated on the income generated by both fees, it is taken only from the Educational Fee.  The amount returned to aid for undergraduate students is 33 percent and 50 percent for graduate students).  The fee level, set by The Regents, varies between resident undergraduate, graduate students, and nonresident students.  Undergraduate residents pay $6,252 and Graduate residents pay $7,122.  After deducting funds for financial aid, the campus receives incremental Ed Fees at the rate of about $3,700 for each additional budgeted FTE student.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em><strong>Registration Fees (Reg Fee)</strong></em> - This is a system wide mandatory fee, and the fee level is set by The Regents.  The Reg Fee is retained entirely by the campus and is used to support a variety of student service activities such as counseling and mental health services, academic advising, tutorial assistance, and cultural and recreation programs.  The Student Fee Advisory Committee (comprised of students, faculty, and staff) provide advice to the VC Student Affairs and the Chancellor on the allocation of these funds.  These funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including capital projects.  When the state targeted a cut to the student service programs supported by the Reg Fee in 2003-04, UCSC students placed a referendum on the ballot to institute a new mandatory fee - known as Measure 7 - to preserve the variety and quality of student programs that were threatened by a state imposed cut. Measure 7 passed overwhelmingly and is now a campus based mandatory fee at UCSC.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em><strong>Campus-based Mandatory Fees</strong></em> - These are fees initiated and approved by students via a student referendum, and later approved by The Regents.  They are mandatory, as a condition of enrollment.  The list of campus-based mandatory fees differs between campuses.  At UCSC, there are 27 distinct mandatory fees, including the college student government fee, the transit fee, the child care fee, various student facility fees,Measure 7, and the seismic-life-safety fee.  The type of fees and fee levels vary between UG and Graduate students, based on the terms of the student referendum. The revenues must be used consistent with the terms of the referendum.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em><strong>Miscellaneous and Course Material Fees</strong></em> - These are user fees and service charges.  They are not mandatory as a condition of enrollment and are only charged to students and others when they actually use the service (i.e. application fees, duplicate diplomas fee, course material fees, lab use fees, etc.).  The revenue from these fees is used to support the service provided.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em><strong>Nonresident tuition</strong></em> - A mandatory fee charged to undergraduate and graduate students who are not residents of California with the fee level set by The Regents.  Historically, all nonresident tuition is considered as UC General Funds and is used to help support the general fund operating budget. In some years, the Regents have chosen to pledge the incremental increase in nonresident tuition to help fund deferred maintenance funded through long-term debt. In 2007-08 the Office of the President began providing campuses with enrollment targets for nonresident students.  Going forward, this change required campuses to be responsible for nonresident enrollment and nonresident tuition revenues.</p>

<p>Federal funds are received for student financial aid (mostly work-study and loans) and the research activities of the faculty.  Federal grants provide support for graduate students, post doctoral researchers, professional staff, as well as technical and administrative elements of the research infrastructure.  Federal grants also generate indirect cost receipts.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Contracts and grants are awarded to principal investigators to support direct costs of research (consistent with OMB Circular A21).  These funds, which go to individual faculty rather than to the campus, are not budgeted and are not part of the campus's annual budget process.  These are restricted according to the terms and conditions of the grant.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Overhead reimbursements (indirect cost recovery) are tied to the expenditure of direct costs.  The amount is based on the indirect cost rate, which includes the cost of facilities (such as equipment, research space, maintenance and utilities, and the library) as well as departmental administration and support.  Effective 7/1/06 the on-campus rate was 51% and on 7/1/08 increased to 51.5%.  This is within the range relative to the other UC campuses - UCR is 50%, UCSB is 51.5%, UCD is 52%, UCB is 53%, UCLA is 54% and UCSD is 54.5%.  The "effective" rate (the amount actually generated as a % of expenditures) is closer to 27% because not all federal contracts and grants generate the full overhead rate, i.e. equipment grants, grants for off-campus research use the "off-campus rate" and sometimes the overhead is waived or is reduced.  Waivers of overhead require approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research.  In general, waivers and reductions are not encouraged and are no longer common.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>All federal overhead goes to OP and is then allocated to the campuses based on how the funds were generated.  The overhead is split into three categories.  OP retains 6% of the revenue generated in each category of indirect costs and returns 94% to the campus, as shown on the following chart.</p>
<br/>

<p align="center"><a href="Images/ICRdistribution.jpg"><img border="0" height="137" src="Images/ICRdistribution-sm.jpg" width="464"/></a><br/>
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Off the Top Funds</strong> - About 20% of federal indirect cost receipts flow into the "Off-The-Top Fund" (OTT).  OTT is used for administrative costs related to the accounting and administration of grant-related activities such as the Sponsored Projects Office and Extramural Accounting.  OTT cannot be used for capital projects.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Opportunity Funds</strong> - 36% of federal indirect costs become known as Opportunity Funds.  OP's portion of Opportunity Funds are used for such things as the Keck Telescope.  The campus opportunity funds are flexible dollars.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>General Fund</strong> - The remaining 44% is used, along with state funds and education fee revenue, to support the University's general fund budget.</p>

<p>Gifts and private grants are received from alumni and other friends of the University, campus-related organizations, corporations, foundations, and other nonprofit entities.  Private grants are received from for-profit and other organizations.  This funding is generally for a specific purpose - such as a scholarship or an endowed chair - and is a restricted, nonrecurring funding source.  Although restricted, private funds provide enhancements to the academic program beyond what would otherwise be possible.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Depending on the policies of the granting agency, some private grants include overhead.  The amount may range from 1% to 9% of the grant.  All overhead from private sources is returned to the Office of the President.  UCOP retains a portion, and returns the balance to the campus as Educational Funds (not to be confused with the Ed Fee that is paid by students).</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">2008-09 budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's permanent cut in 2008-09 was $4.5 million. The campus also received a one-time, mid-year cut of $6 million, the majority of which was covered from campus central reserves.</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">2009-10 budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is planning for permanent cuts in 2009-10 of $13 million. This includes base budget cuts from the State, as well as mandatory cost increases for employee benefits, utilities, and faculty merits.</p>

<h3><font color="#285991">Summary of two-year budget reductions</font></h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The cumulative impact over two years is that UC Santa Cruz has incurred reduction in the State-funded portion of our budget of over 9 percent. The cutback in state funding, combined with the mandatory cost increases expected next year, are of such a magnitude that no area of campus can be spared from permanent budget reductions.</p>

<p>The viability of the State 2009-10 budget plan depends not only upon the passage of propositions on the May 19 ballot but also on assumptions about how quickly the California economy will recover. In March, the Legislative Analyst projected that revenues will fall short of the assumptions in the budget package by $8 billion. In May, the California Department of Finance will revise their revenue estimates at which time the Governor will propose further measures to balance the State budget.</p>

Cribbs</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>
<p><strong>Major:</strong> Literature with an emphasis in fiction and poetry</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Arroyo Grande, CA</p>
<p><strong>UCSC college:</strong> Kresge</p>
<h3>Favorite class or professor and why?</h3>
<p>The best class I've ever taken was called <em>Native American Indian Music and Thought.</em> We read an abundance of Native American Indian creation myths, followed a line of American history not to be found in most textbooks, distinguished specific regional instruments and vocals by ear, were exposed to both ongoing political and ethical dilemmas surrounding Native American life-ways, and also delved deep into North American ethnomusicology.</p>
<h3>Most memorable experience at UCSC?</h3>
<p>Freshman year. There's absolutely nothing like being on your own for the first time. Nothing.</p>
<h3>Favorite spot on campus and why?</h3>
<p>The track at the East Field House and the memorial bench at the edge of the East Field. It's my favorite spot on campus because the greater Monterey Bay wraps around the vista. It's a great place to just sit and watch the sailboats pixelating the big blue screen of the Pacific Ocean. It's also a great place to just sit back and relax.</p>
<h3>How has UCSC shaped you?</h3>
<p>I have so many friends who seem to have spent their college experiences at other universities cultivating a sense of extreme competition in whatever field they've chosen to pursue. Here at UCSC, I've learned that I don't always need to be flying at jet-speed or competing with peers. I feel very lucky to have been shaped into a type of student who is well-rounded, willing to work cooperatively, and who can approach multiple disciplines with sensitivity and respect.</p>
<h3>What are your future plans?</h3>
<p>This summer I'm set to be an acting intern for <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org">Shakespeare Santa Cruz,</a> our resident professional theater community. Next year, I'll be working on a graduate-level certification program with the UCSC Theater Arts Department. I'll have a dual focus on both acting and playwriting. After finishing both programs, I'll apply to graduate school. My hope is to gain an M.F.A. in acting and/or a Ph.D. in social anthropology. The idea is to end up teaching and/or advancing certain aspects of performative (or performance) anthropology.</p>
<h3>How did you choose your college, and how has your college affected your education?</h3>
<p>I chose Kresge because I was ready to manage my own living space; ready to have my own apartment freshman year. The faculty and staff there have propelled me and supported me in numerous ways, going above and beyond their job descriptions to help me succeed. What I'll take away most from Kresge is the idea that community and cooperation are vital aspects of not only student life, but life in general. I'm so glad I was placed there.</p>
