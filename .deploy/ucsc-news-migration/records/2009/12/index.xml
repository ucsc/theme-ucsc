The campus attracted $30.5 million in private gifts from 14,132 individual and institutional donors. That is nearly an 18 percent increase in gifts compared to 2007-08.</p><p>We achieved numerous philanthropic milestones, and we hope to achieve many more. UCSC has joined a four-year systemwide effort, called <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/youcan/">Project You Can</a>, to raise $1 billion for student financial support programs. </p><p>Thanks to hundreds of private gifts, we matched a challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation, funding an expansion of McHenry Library to enhance its capacity to serve students, faculty, and others. An $875,000 grant from the Packard Foundation enabled one of our most promising young astronomers to expand his research. That researcher, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, dedicates part of a National Science Foundation grant to helping area underprivileged youth prepare academically and socially for college.

Certainly, private gifts will help offset continued declines in public funding. But, the most profound reasons to support UC Santa Cruz are found in its people, their uncommon excellence and unbridled promise.</p><p>Our people are working to protect the world's coastlines. Advance global economic policy. Unearth undiscovered languages. Better understand the origins of the universe and all its creatures. Your continued support will help make all this, and more, possible.</p><p>Cordially,<p style="margin-bottom:0px;"><img alt="George Blumenthal" src="http://www.ucsc.edu/includes/template/email/images/official/signature.gif" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;border:none;"/></p>George Blumenthal</p><p>Chancellor</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915e8aa58072704601a012ff39bade8d"><name>3411</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Priorities in Sacramento leave students drowning in debt</title><summary>Matthew Palm, commissioner of academic affairs for the UCSC Student Union Assembly, contributed this op-ed in response to the Regents' vote to hike student fees. </summary><description>Matthew Palm, commissioner of academic affairs for the UCSC Student Union Assembly, contributed this op-ed in response to the Regents' vote to hike student fees. </description><start-date>1259650800000</start-date><display-name>Priorities in Sacramento leave...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3411</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3411</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339146355</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339146355</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/12/images/palm_matt.180.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/12/images/palm_matt.180.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>palm_matt.180.jpg</name><file-size>36875</file-size><width>180</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Matthew Palm, commissioner of academic affairs for the UCSC Student Union Assembly</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>By Matthew Palm</p>
<p>From the vantage point of a television viewer or newspaper reader, the events surrounding the UC Regents' vote to raise fees for undergraduates 32 percent must appear to be vivid allusions to the student protests of the 1960s. In fact, they are just the opposite.</p>
<p>The UC students of today struggle not against "the machine" as Mario Savio termed it; rather, we lobby and demonstrate so that we can stay at the university, so that our younger siblings will have some affordable college prospects left by the end of this recession.</p>
<p>How did we get to this point, where students feel compelled to hold sit-ins outside of class so that they can afford to still sit in class?</p>
<p>Missing from much of the commentary surrounding the recent fee hike vote is acknowledgment of the fact that every Regent save the Student Regent voted for the fee hikes. Even Eddie Island, often praised for his concern for students, voted for the first time as Regent in favor of a fee hike.</p>
<p>Why would Regents sympathetic to students and parents vote for one of the largest fee hikes in UC history? The answer is actually very simple: Funding from the State of California has declined from $15,860 per student in 1990 to just $9,560 per student in 2008 (dollars adjusted for inflation). As a direct result of this, undergraduate student fees more than doubled from 2001 to 2009, forcing my generation of Californians to pay more for school than any class before us. Each new entering class seems to face new challenges as each year we are burdened with higher costs.</p>
<p>How do we deal with educational costs deemed inconceivable a generation ago? Many students, like me, work more than 20 hours a week while studying as full time students. In 2005 and 2006 (when fees were considerably lower than they are now), 12 percent of undergraduate students reported working more than 20 hours a week. According the university, 51 percent of students graduated in debt during the 2006-07 school year, with the average debt burden being just under $15,000.</p>
<p>When California had a booming economy, graduates could more easily handle this burden. Today we are graduating into a state with a 12.5 percent unemployment rate and a much larger underemployment rate. This is why so many of my peers burst into tears in front of television news cameras at the Regents meeting in November at UCLA, begging the board not to strain us or our families with any more debt.</p>
<p>As a senior looking back on my four years here, I am genuinely questioning how someone could carry so much stress, work so much, and still successfully manage to delve as deeply into our wonderful curriculum as our professors would like.</p>
<p>We want to be here, we want to learn, and we want to get an education and make a meaningful impact in the world. But constant financial strain coupled with bleak job prospects make our desires that much harder to attain. As my mother tells me on almost a weekly basis now, "Matt--don't forget, there are only 24 hours in a day."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, decades of disinvestment from higher education by the state leave my peers and I fending for ourselves while at the same time the state continues to funnel tax dollars into expanding prisons. If the saying that public budgets reflect public values holds water, then right now I must question if California's government is expecting my little brother to end up in prison instead of college. This may sound inflammatory, but right now prison funding is a greater portion of our state budget than funding for all three segments of public higher education combined. Again, these misbalanced priorities in Sacramento leave California students drowning in debt.</p>
<p>Every dollar invested in the UC is said to yield three dollars for the state. We are an economic machine and a long-term source of prosperity for California. Can we say the same about prisons?</p>
<p>Please take a minute to contact your state representatives and strongly encourage them to make public higher education a real priority again.</p>

In our new roles, we are co-chairs of a newly established campus Diversity Advisory Committee that includes broad campus representation.</p>
<p>In June 2009, our campus submitted a report to the Office of the President for inclusion in a regental diversity accountability report and framework. As part of that effort, our campus is required to establish and report on annual diversity goals. This Diversity Accountability Framework will drive all that we will do on campus.</p>
<p>Despite the budget situation, we have exciting initiatives and programs planned for the academic year, using available resources and a small investment directed toward critical program areas. For example, we will develop a Diversity Certificate Series that will be available for faculty and staff.</p>
<p>In addition, numerous programs already exist that demonstrate our commitment to diversity, such as the Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity, the Leadership Academy, and the newly released Fair Hiring Online Training. We will continue to keep you apprised of these and other efforts as they unfold.</p>
<p>In order to best serve the campus, we want to outline the areas of responsibility of staff working under Assistant Chancellor Sahni's and Vice Provost Galloway's supervision in their diversity, inclusion, and EEO/AA compliance-related efforts.

<p>Two public forums have been called by the commission to solicit the widest possible array of ideas for consideration as UC seeks ways of sustaining its quality and accessibility amid the unrelenting state budget pressures. Faculty, staff, students, parents, alumni, leaders of community and business groups, and members of the general public who care about the future of higher education are all invited to participate.</p>
<p>The first forum will be held Dec. 8 in San Francisco. It follows town hall meetings being held on all 10 UC campuses in November and December. Those town halls were called to provide information about the commission to members of the UC community and to solicit feedback on the early directions of its work.</p>
<p>"These public forums are another effort to engage Californians in a conversation about the future of their public research university," said UC President Mark Yudof, who joined Board of Regents Chairman Russell Gould in launching the commission earlier this year. "As the commission's working groups take shape, it is essential that we hear from all quarters about the things Californians most need and value from the University of California--and that we also hear a broad spectrum of ideas about potential solutions to the fiscal challenge we face."</p>
<p>The commission's five working groups--which will focus on the <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/sizeofuc.html">size and shape of UC</a>, <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/education.html">education and curriculum</a>, <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/access.html"></a>access and affordability, <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/funding.html">funding strategies</a>, and <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/research.html">research strategies</a>--are composed of a wide spectrum of members drawn from the Regents, faculty, students, alumni, administration, staff, and other experts not affiliated with UC. Close consultation with the Academic Senate will be essential for commission recommendations pertaining to curriculum and other core faculty responsibilities.</p>
<p>The commission will be grappling with how to continue the university's legacy of promoting the public good--through its education, research, health care, and public service--when state resources that historically have funded a large share of the university's core activities continue to erode. The commission's <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/">web site</a> contains summaries of many of the issues under preliminary consideration by the working groups.</p>
<p>The public forums will be meetings of the full Commission on the Future. The Dec. 8 public forum will be held from 1:30 -4:30 p.m. at the UCSF Mission Bay Community Center, 1675 Owens St., San Francisco. A second forum is expected to be held in Southern California in January; the specific date and location will be available in January on the commission's web site.</p>
<p>Interested members of the public are invited to learn more about the commission and review background reading material at <a href="http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu</a>.</p>

These are the markers I used to guide me in selecting this splendid season."</p><p>Among the intimate redwoods in the outdoor Sinsheimer-Stanley Glen, SSC will present two contrasting plays by William Shakespeare--the bittersweet, romantic comedy Love's <i>Labour's Lost</i> and the masterpiece of revenge <i>Othello</i>. </p><p>The indoor Theatre Arts Mainstage will be the venue for a drama of personality and political intrigue: <i>The Lion in Winter</i> by James Goldman. </p><p>All three plays will be performed in repertory from July 20 through August 29, 2010. </p><p><b>Love's Labour's Lost</b> is Shakespeare's most profoundly Elizabethan comedy, replete with witty debates, dazzling wordplay, and strongly drawn comic characters. This bittersweet--at times hysterically funny--play was written around the time of the playwright's most prolific period (1595), the same year he penned Richard II. </p><p>The play is set in Navarre, a kingdom devoted to the quest for self-improvement through bookish study. The king's youthfully naive self-imposed command not to allow the distraction of women into the court is all but shattered with the arrival of the Princess of France and her feminine entourage.  </p><p>The men, who had vowed to avoid all women in favor of intellectual pursuits, immediately fall head over heels and begin finding ways to allow the power of love to take its natural prominence over learning and the affairs of state.  But the realities of life finally intrude on the revelries.</p><p>Shakespeare created two masterstrokes with <b>Othello</b>-one of his most hateful villains, and one of his most poignant tragic heroes. The work is a tour de force of revenge that examines the inner workings of a sick mind with astounding detail and explores how the power of suggestion can transform a perfect love into murderous jealousy.  </p><p>Shakespeare sets Iago's pathological fiendishness against Othello's honesty, love, and integrity. The playwright subverts the racial stereotypes accepted by the audiences of his day to embrace the deception of appearances and the grave danger of assumptions.</p><p>The plot of <b>The Lion in Winter</b> sounds as if the play should be set in 21st century America, rather than 12th century Europe, with its insecure siblings fighting for their parents' attention; bickering spouses who can't stand to be together or apart; adultery and sexual experimentation; and the struggle to balance work and family. </p><p>Henry II and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, are battling each other to put the son they each prefer on the throne of England. The problem is that they don't agree on which of their three scheming sons it should be. </p><p><i>The Lion in Winter</i> is the quintessential drama of family strife and competing ambitions, delivered with historical and psychological insight, breathtaking language, and delicious, biting cleverness.</p><p>Subscriptions for the 2010 season of Shakespeare Santa Cruz go on sale in March; single tickets will be available in April. </p><p>For more season and ticket information, please visit the <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org">SSC web site</a> or call the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.</p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ea8e28072704601a012ffbe6a9149"><name>3425</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Psychology professor Craig Haney played an instrumental role in a &lt;b&gt;Washington Post&lt;/b&gt; editorial calling for the abolition of long-term solitary confinement.</summary><description>Psychology professor Craig Haney played an instrumental role in a &lt;b&gt;Washington Post&lt;/b&gt; editorial calling for the abolition of long-term solitary confinement.</description><start-date>1259910000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3425</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3425</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339154091</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339154091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Psychology professor Craig Haney played an instrumental role in a <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/27/AR2009112702912.html">editorial</a> calling for the abolition of long-term solitary confinement.

The University of California's open access digital publishing platform now has a fresh look and a new array of publishing services for the University of California scholarly community and a dynamic research platform for scholars worldwide.</p>
<p>Previously known as UC's eScholarship Repository, the new eScholarship offers a robust scholarly publishing platform that enables departments, research units, publishing programs, and individual scholars associated with the University of California to have direct control over the creation and dissemination of the full range of their scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>eScholarship publication types</strong></p>
<p>UC-affiliated scholars, editors, and research unit administrators can publish the following original works in eScholarship:</p>

<ul>
<li>Journals<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Books <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Working papers<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Conference proceedings<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Seminar/paper series</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>eScholarship also continues to provide deposit and dissemination services for previously published articles or "postprints."</p>
<p><strong>New services, enhanced functionality</strong></p>
<p>The relaunch of eScholarship brings new opportunities for digital publishing to the University of California and offers substantially improved services for previously supported publication types.</p>
<p>Books published in eScholarship are now eligible for a combined digital/print publication service, courtesy of UC Publishing Services (UCPubS), a joint program of UC Press and the California Digital Library. In addition, eScholarship now offers conference lifecycle support, including mechanisms for proposal submission, program display, and the ultimate publication of proceedings.</p>
<p>Much of the site redesign has been focused on improving the quality of access to eScholarship publications. The site is optimized for Google searches; PDFs can be viewed and searched in their entirety without download; and research can be shared easily through third-party social networking sites and RSS feeds.</p>
<p>These new services and tools all add up to a vastly enhanced experience for authors, editors, and publishing program directors--and for the researchers who seek out their work.</p>
<p>What can UC authors expect from publishing with eScholarship?</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital publication of original scholarship <br/>

Most of the time, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> lurks in estuaries and other semisalty aquatic habitats. </p><p>Understanding the pathogen's behavior between epidemics and its transitions between different environments could help public health officials prevent outbreaks, according to microbiologist Fitnat Yildiz.</p><p>"If you know the mechanisms by which an organism can survive in the environment, you can better devise systems to prevent its transmission," said Yildiz, an associate professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>The optimal salt concentration for growth and survival of V. cholerae is similar to that found in brackish water and estuaries. But the bacteria experience fluctuations in salinity both in their aquatic habitat and during human infections.</p><p>A recent analysis by Yildiz and graduate student Nick Shikuma revealed that changes in salinity affect the activity of a wide range of the pathogen's genes. Among these is a gene the researchers called OscR, which appears to play an important role in managing the pathogen's response to fluctuating salt levels in the environment. (More precisely, it responds to changes in osmolarity, a measure of the concentration of dissolved substances.) Yildiz and Shikuma described their findings in a recent paper in the <i>Journal of Bacteriology</i>. </p><p>Cholera outbreaks occur when environmental conditions allow the bacteria to contaminate sources of drinking water. "Cholera is a disease of disaster," Yildiz said. "Whenever there's a breakdown in public health, like during the Iraq War or in refugee camps, when people don't have access to clean drinking water, cases of cholera increase." </p><p>In areas of Africa and South Asia where cholera is endemic, outbreaks occur seasonally. Two peaks coincide with the dry season and the monsoon rains, according to Paul Dunlap of the University of Michigan, who wrote a commentary accompanying the paper in the <i>Journal of Bacteriology</i>. During the dry season, freshwater sources become more salty, opening them to colonization by <i>V. cholerae</i>. Flood conditions during monsoons can also lead to contamination of drinking water sources.</p><p>Yildiz and Shikuma found more than 300 cholera genes that respond to changes in salinity, many of which Yildiz and others had previously linked to the pathogen's deadliness. In medium salt environments similar to the human body, for instance, genes controlling virulence rev up.  </p><p>The researchers found that OscR is a regulatory gene that switches on under low salt conditions and controls the activity of other genes. OscR increases bacterial motility and decreases the formation of sticky cell groupings called biofilm, Yildiz said. </p><p>Biofilm colonies form when individual cells secrete matrices of sugar chains and proteins that help them glom on to neighbors and to surfaces. Many kinds of bacteria form biofilms, which act as bacterial shields, making cells harder to kill and more tolerant of environmental fluctuations. Within biofilms, <i>V. cholerae</i> is more resistant to antimicrobial and chlorine-based disinfectant treatments, Yildiz said.</p><p>"What we learn with respect to the mechanisms of biofilm formation in <i>V. cholerae</i> could be applicable to other organisms because biofilm formation is so prevalent and it is so important for clinical, environmental, and industrial processes," she said.</p><p><i>V. cholerae</i> forms biofilms both in infected hosts and in the environment. During cholera infection, biofilms cling to intestinal walls, releasing a steady stream of debilitating toxins. Scientists have even found biofilms riding through the water on tiny crustaceans called copepods, as well as in stool samples from cholera patients.</p><p>Yildiz has been investigating the network of genetic interactions that regulates biofilm formation. This network, in which environmental cues regulate genes that control other genes, works like a complex domino chain in which one piece knocks down several others.</p><p>OscR blocks the toppling dominos that lead to biofilm formation. Why the pathogen prefers being a mobile single cell in freshwater remains a mystery but is the topic of future study, Yildiz said. Knowing how the pathogen passes through freshwater versus salty water may help to expose the dynamics of cholera infections, she said.  </p><p>But shifts in environmental dynamics rarely occur in isolation. Changes in salinity go hand-in-hand with changing temperatures and nutrient levels. A holistic model of <i>V. cholerae</i> behavior, Yildiz said, will include how these factors work in tandem.  </p><p>"We are analyzing environmental fluctuations singly, but the goal is to eventually combine them," she said. "When you combine multiple stresses, you get a different response."  </p><p>Yildiz collaborates with scientists in Bangladesh who help her re-create South Asian estuary or freshwater conditions in the lab. Eventually, however, she wants to study <i>V. cholerae</i> in the field.  </p><p>Cholera is readily treated, but without treatment it causes rapid and often fatal dehydration from severe diarrhea. The World Health Organization estimates that 120,000 people die from cholera every year.

"We are proud and delighted that the team so effectively developed their ethical reasoning and debating skills, learned so much, and had such a good time by participating in the Ethics Bowl competition."</p><p>					</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915eb6528072704601a012ff3de50d20"><name>3431</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>H1N1 Flu and Seasonal Flu Shots Thursday 12/10/09 at Student Union</title><start-date>1260169200000</start-date><display-name>H1N1 Flu and Seasonal...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3431</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3431</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339157521</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339157521</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are pleased to announce that we just received an additional 300 additional doses of H1N1 influenza vaccine, which we will administer ONLY to registered students under the age of 25 with a reservation.

The eight meters currently in the PA lot will be removed, and 17 spaces will be designated for paystation parking.</p><p>The cost for all meter and paystation parking is $1.50 per hour. Meters accept nickels, dimes and quarters only; paystations accept nickels, dimes, quarters, $1 coins, $1 and $2 bills, Visa, and Mastercard. Paystations cannot provide change or refunds, but can accept early payments beginning at 5:30 am. After 4:30 pm weekdays, and all day on weekends, paystations allow a $3 flat rate for parking until 8:30 pm (in addition to smaller increments of time); the flat rate allows parking in the entire lot, not just in designated paystation spaces. Paystations can be found at the Core West Parking Structure, Hahn Student Services, East Field House, and the Performing Arts lot; all have a two-hour limit except for Hahn, which has a one-hour limit.</p><p>Because paystations offer multiple payment options, if any single payment method becomes inoperable, another method can be selected. In the event of malfunction, please call 459-4543 to report the problem. Parking is not allowed in pay stalls without payment, so if a paystation is malfunctioning please find another location to park; otherwise Parking Enforcement (Campus Police) may cite your vehicle. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Campus Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915eb8e18072704601a012ff164e3a60"><name>3433</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New 'green guide' provides direction on what to do with stuff</title><summary>Environmental Health and Safety has produced a "green guide" to help you manage unwanted items.</summary><author>Communications and Marketing Office (831-459-2495)</author><keywords>Environmental Health and Safety, UCSC Recycling and Disposal Guide, green guide</keywords><description>Environmental Health and Safety has produced a "green guide" to help you manage unwanted items.</description><start-date>1260342000000</start-date><display-name>New 'green guide' provides...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3433</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3433</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339158184</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339158184</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="http://ehs.ucsc.edu/">Environmental Health and Safety</a> has produced a "green guide" to help you manage unwanted stuff.</p>

Three of the four campus parking lots with paystations do not require permits on weekends.

My previous email to the campus erroneously implied that permits are required on weekends in all lots with paystations.</p><p>The intentions of the announced changes are to 1) make the hours of enforcement consistent between paystations and parking meters, and 2) provide additional hourly parking options in the Performing Arts lot during weekdays.

Langton, Principia College.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An international team of planet hunters has discovered as many as six low-mass planets around two nearby Sun-like stars, including two "super-Earths" with masses 5 and 7.5 times the mass of Earth. The researchers, led by Steven Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said the two "super-Earths" are the first ones found around Sun-like stars.</p>
<p>"These detections indicate that low-mass planets are quite common around nearby stars. The discovery of potentially habitable nearby worlds may be just a few years away," said Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>The team found the new planet systems by combining data gathered at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) in New South Wales, Australia. Two papers describing the new planets have been accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>
<p>Three of the new planets orbit the bright star 61 Virginis, which can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies in the Spring constellation Virgo. Astronomers and astrobiologists have long been fascinated with this particular star, which is only 28 light-years away. Among hundreds of our nearest stellar neighbors, 61 Vir stands out as being the most nearly similar to the Sun in terms of age, mass, and other essential properties. Vogt and his collaborators have found that 61 Vir hosts at least three planets, with masses ranging from about 5 to 25 times the mass of Earth.</p>
<p>Recently, a separate team of astronomers used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope to discover that 61 Vir also contains a thick ring of dust at a distance roughly twice as far from 61 Vir as Pluto is from our Sun. The dust is apparently created by collisions of comet-like bodies in the cold outer reaches of the system.</p>
<p>"Spitzer's detection of cold dust orbiting 61 Vir indicates that there's a real kinship between the Sun and 61 Vir," said Eugenio Rivera, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC. Rivera computed an extensive set of numerical simulations to find that a habitable Earth-like world could easily exist in the as-yet unexplored region between the newly discovered planets and the outer dust disk.</p>
<p>According to Vogt, the planetary system around 61 Vir is an excellent candidate for study by the new Automated Planet Finder (APF) Telescope recently constructed at Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton near San Jose. "Needless to say, we're very excited to continue monitoring this system using APF," said Vogt, who is the principal investigator for the APF and is building a spectrometer for the new telescope that is optimized for finding planets.</p>
<p>The second new system found by the team features a 7.5-Earth-mass planet orbiting HD 1461, another near-perfect twin of the Sun located 76 light-years away. At least one and possibly two additional planets also orbit the star. Lying in the constellation Cetus, HD 1461 can be seen with the naked eye in the early evening under good dark-sky conditions.</p>
<p>The 7.5-Earth-mass planet, assigned the name HD 1461b, has a mass nearly midway between the masses of Earth and Uranus. The researchers said they cannot tell yet if HD 1461b is a scaled-up version of Earth, composed largely of rock and iron, or whether, like Uranus and Neptune, it is composed mostly of water.</p>
<p>According to Butler, the new detections required state-of-the-art instruments and detection techniques. "The inner planet of the 61 Vir system is among the two or three lowest-amplitude planetary signals that have been identified with confidence," he said. "We've found there is a tremendous advantage to be gained from combining data from the AAT and Keck telescopes, two world-class observatories, and it's clear that we'll have an excellent shot at identifying potentially habitable planets around the very nearest stars within just a few years."</p>
<p>The 61 Vir and HD 1461 detections add to a slew of recent discoveries that have upended conventional thinking regarding planet detection. In the past year, it has become evident that planets orbiting the Sun's nearest neighbors are extremely common. According to Butler, current indications are that fully one-half of nearby stars have a detectable planet with mass equal to or less than Neptune's.</p>
<p>The Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey Team led by Vogt and Butler uses radial velocity measurements from ground-based telescopes to detect the "wobble" induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The radial-velocity observations were complemented with precise brightness measurements acquired with robotic telescopes in Arizona by Gregory Henry of Tennessee State University.</p>
<p>"We don't see any brightness variability in either star," said Henry. "This assures us that the wobbles really are due to planets and not changing patterns of dark spots on the stars."</p>
<p>Due to improvements in equipment and observing techniques, these ground-based methods are now capable of finding Earth-mass objects around nearby stars, according to team member Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>"It's come down to a neck-and-neck race as to whether the first potentially habitable planets will be detected from the ground or from space," Laughlin said. "A few years ago, I'd have put my money on space-based detection methods, but now it really appears to be a toss-up. What is truly exciting about the current ground-based radial velocity detection method is that it is capable of locating the very closest potentially habitable planets."</p>
<p>The Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey Team has developed a publicly available tool, the Systemic Console, which enables members of the public to search for the signals of extrasolar planets by exploring real data sets in a straightforward and intuitive way. This tool is available online at <a href="http://oklo.org">www.oklo.org</a>.</p>
<p>This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA. In addition to Vogt, Butler, Rivera, Laughlin, and Henry, the coauthors of the 61 Vir paper include Rob Wittenmyer, C. G. Tinney, and Jeremy Bailey of the University of New South Wales; Simon O'Toole and Hugh Jones of the University of Hertfordshire; Stefano Meschiari of UCSC; Brad Carter of the University of Southern Queensland; and Konstantin Batygin of Caltech. The authors of the HD 1461 paper are Rivera, Butler, Vogt, Laughlin, Henry, and Meschiari.</p>

She joins artists working in a broad array of disciplines, including architecture, design, crafts, dance, literature, music, theater arts, and visual arts.</p><p>"This fellowship enables me to jumpstart the production of my new documentary about the sterilization of Mexican American women during the 1960s and '70s," said Tajima-Peña. "As soon as I was notified of the award, I scheduled a shoot. I couldn't wait to start work. This fellowship is a lifesaver." </p><p>Tajima-Peña's films include the Oscar-nominated <i>Who Killed Vincent Chin?</i> and the highly acclaimed feature-length documentary <i>Calavera Highway</i>. Tajima-Peña teaches documentary film making and video production at UCSC. Her work focuses on Asian American and immigrant communities, media, and social change.</p><p>USA Fellowships are awarded to emerging, mid-career, and established artists who demonstrate artistic excellence, unique artistic vision, and have made significant contributions to their fields. Recipients are selected by panels of experts in the arts. This year, 348 nominees from 45 states were invited to apply. Other recipients this year include poet and novelist Sapphire, whose novel <i>Push</i> was made into the new film <i>Precious</i>, and actor and playwright Anna Deavere Smith. </p><p>"Artists fuel the nation's cultural vitality and illuminate the issues and complexities of our time," said Susan V.

But according to planetary scientist Francis Nimmo, evidence from recent NASA missions suggests that conditions necessary for life may exist on the icy satellites of Saturn and Jupiter. </p><p>"If these moons are habitable, it changes the whole idea of the habitable zone," said Nimmo, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "It changes our thinking about how and where we might find life outside of the solar system."</p><p>Nimmo discussed the impact of ice dynamics on the habitability of the moons of Saturn and Jupiter on Tuesday, December 15, at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.</p><p>Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, in particular, have attracted attention because of evidence that oceans of liquid water may lie beneath their icy surfaces. This evidence, plus discoveries of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities on Earth, suggests to some that these frozen moons just might harbor life. </p><p>"Liquid water is the one requirement for life that everyone can agree on," Nimmo said.</p><p>The icy surfaces may insulate deep oceans, shift and fracture like tectonic plates, and mediate the flow of material and energy between the moons and space. </p><p>Several lines of evidence support the presence of subsurface oceans on Europa and Enceladus, Nimmo said. In 2000, for example, NASA's Galileo spacecraft measured an unusual magnetic field around Europa that was attributed to the presence of an ocean beneath the moon's surface. On Enceladus, the Cassini spacecraft discovered geysers shooting ice crystals a hundred miles above the surface, which also suggests at least pockets of subsurface water, Nimmo said (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1293">earlier story</a>).</p><p>Liquid water isn't easy to find in the cold expanses beyond Earth's orbit. But according to Nimmo, tidal forces could keep subsurface oceans from freezing up. Europa and Enceladus both have eccentric orbits that bring them alternately close to and then far away from their respective planets. These elongated orbits create ebbs and flows of gravitational energy between the planets and their satellites.</p><p>"A moon like Enceladus is getting squeezed and stretched and squeezed and stretched," Nimmo said.</p><p>The extent to which this squeezing and stretching transforms into heat remains unclear, he said. Tidal forces likely shift plates in the lunar cores, creating friction and geothermal energy. This energy may also rub surface ice against itself at the sites of deep ice fissures, creating heat and melting, according to Nimmo. Enceladus's geysers appear to originate from these shifting faults, and the thin lines running along Europa's surface suggest geologically active plates, he said.</p><p>A frozen outer layer may be crucial to maintaining oceans that could harbor life on these moons. The icy surfaces may shield the oceans from the frigidity of space and from radiation harmful to living organisms.</p><p>"If you want to have life, you want the ocean to last a long time," Nimmo said. "The ice above acts like an insulating blanket."</p><p>Enceladus is so small and its ice so thin that scientists expect its oceans to freeze periodically, making habitability less likely, Nimmo said. Europa, however, is the perfect size to heat its oceans efficiently. It is larger than Enceladus but smaller than moons such as Ganymede, which has thick ice surrounding its core and blocking communication with the exterior. If liquid water exists on Ganymede, it may be trapped between layers of ice that separate it from both the core and the surface.</p><p>The core and the surface of these moons are both potential sources of the chemical building blocks needed for life. Solar radiation and comet impacts leave a chemical film on the surfaces. To sustain living organisms, these chemicals would have to migrate to the subsurface oceans, and this can occur periodically around ice fissures on moons with relatively thin ice shells like Europa and Enceladus. Organic molecules and minerals may also stream out of their cores, Nimmo said. These nutrients could support communities like those seen around hydrothermal vents on Earth.</p><p>Nimmo cautioned that being habitable is no guarantee that a planetary body is actually inhabited. It is unlikely that we will find life elsewhere in our solar system, despite all the time and resources devoted to the search, he said. But such a discovery would certainly be worth the effort.</p><p>"I think pretty much everyone can agree that finding life anywhere else in the solar system would be the scientific discovery of the millennium," Nimmo said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ed1ee8072704601a012ff8effeafb"><name>3444</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pre-eruption earthquakes offer clues to volcano forecasters</title><summary>Pre-eruption earthquakes give scientists an opportunity to study the tumult beneath a volcano and may help them improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts.</summary><author>Daniel Strain (831) 459-2495; dstrain@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Emily Brodsky, volcanoes, pre-eruption earthquakes</keywords><description>Pre-eruption earthquakes give scientists an opportunity to study the tumult beneath a volcano and may help them improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts.</description><start-date>1260946800000</start-date><display-name>Pre-eruption earthquakes offer clues...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3444</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3444</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339164565</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339164565</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Daniel Strain</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>dstrain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/12/images/augustine_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/12/images/augustine_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>augustine_300.jpg</name><file-size>43614</file-size><width>300</width><height>249</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The Alaska Volcano Observatory monitors earthquake activity at Augustine volcano (above), which erupted most recently in 2006.

This activity gives scientists an opportunity to study the tumult beneath a volcano and may help them improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts, according to Emily Brodsky, an associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  </p><p>Brodsky presented recent findings on pre-eruption earthquakes on Wednesday, December 16, at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.</p><p>Each volcano has its own personality. Some rumble consistently, while others stop and start. Some rumble and erupt the same day, while others take months, and some never do erupt. Brodsky is trying to find the rules behind these personalities.</p><p>"Volcanoes almost always make some noise before they erupt, but they don't erupt every time they make noise," she said. "One of the big challenges of a volcano observatory is how to handle all the false alarms."</p><p>Brodsky and Luigi Passarelli, a visiting graduate student from the University of Bologna, compiled data on the length of pre-eruption earthquakes, time between eruptions, and the silica content of lava from 54 volcanic eruptions over a 60-year span. They found that the length of a volcano's "run-up"--the time between the onset of earthquakes and an eruption--increases the longer a volcano has been dormant or "in repose." Furthermore, the underlying magma is more viscous or gummy in volcanoes with long run-up and repose times.</p><p>Scientists can use these relationships to estimate how soon a rumbling volcano might erupt. A volcano with frequent eruptions over time, for instance, provides little warning before it blows. The findings can also help scientists decide how long they should stay on alert after a volcano starts rumbling. </p><p>"You can say, 'My volcano is acting up today, so I'd better issue an alert and keep that alert open for 100 days or 10 days, based on what I think the chemistry of the system is,' " Brodsky said. </p><p>Volcano observers are well-versed in the peculiarities of their systems and often issue alerts to match, according to Brodsky. But this study is the first to take those observations and stretch them across all volcanoes, she said.</p><p>"The innovation of this study is trying to stitch together those empirical rules with the underlying physics and find some sort of generality," Brodsky said. </p><p>The underlying physics all lead back to magma, she said. When the pressure in a chamber builds high enough, the magma pushes its way to the volcano's mouth and erupts. The speed of this ascent depends on how viscous the magma is, which depends in turn on the amount of silica in the magma. The less silica, the runnier the magma. The runnier the magma, the quicker the volcanic chamber fills and the quicker it will spew, according to Brodsky.</p><p>The path from chamber to surface isn't easy for magma as it forces its way up through the crust. The jostling of subsurface rock causes pre-eruption tremors, which oscillate in length and severity based on how freely the magma can move.  </p><p>"If the magma's very sticky, then it takes a long time both to recharge the chamber and to push its way to the surface," Brodsky said. "It extends the length of precursory activity."</p><p>Thick magma is the culprit behind the world's most explosive eruptions, because it traps gas and builds pressure like a keg, she said. Mount St. Helens is an example of a volcano fed by viscous magma.</p><p>Brodsky and Passarelli diagrammed the dynamics of magma flow using a simple analytical model of fluids moving through channels. The next step, Brodsky said, is to test the accuracy of their predictions on future eruptions. </p><p>Volcanoes are messy systems, however, with wildly varying structures and mineral ingredients. Observatories will likely have to tweak their predictions based on the unique characteristics of each system, she said.</p><p>In addition to Brodsky and Passarelli, Stephanie Prejean of the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Volcano Observatory contributed to the study that Brodsky will present at the AGU meeting.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ed3e68072704601a012ff5936c01d"><name>3445</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Soap opera in the marsh: Coots foil nest invaders, reject impostors</title><summary>Coots have evolved a remarkable set of cognitive abilities to thwart other coots that lay eggs in their neighbors' nests.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Bruce Lyon, coots, brood parasitism, chick recognition</keywords><description>Coots have evolved a remarkable set of cognitive abilities to thwart other coots that lay eggs in their neighbors' nests.</description><start-date>1260946800000</start-date><display-name>Soap opera in the...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3445</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3445</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339165082</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339165082</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2009/12/images/coot_nest_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2009/12/images/coot_nest_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coot_nest_300.jpg</name><file-size>97843</file-size><width>300</width><height>344</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Coots lay large numbers of eggs, and sometimes lay eggs in their neighbors' nests.

Photo by B. Lyon.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The American coot is a drab, seemingly unremarkable marsh bird common throughout North America. But its reproductive life is full of deception and violence. </p><p>According to biologists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, coots have evolved a remarkable set of cognitive abilities to thwart other coots that lay eggs in their neighbors' nests. In 2003, the researchers showed that <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/04-07/coots.html">coots can count</a> their own eggs and reject ones laid in their nests by other coots. Their latest findings, published this week in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature08655.html"><i>Nature</i></a>, show that coot parents can tell the difference between their own chicks and any impostors that manage to hatch in their nest, and they will violently reject most impostor chicks.</p><p>The findings are particularly striking because so many birds seem to be unable to recognize the chicks of species such as cowbirds and cuckoos, which always lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. This behavior is called brood parasitism, and its success has posed a longstanding challenge to evolutionary theorists. </p><p>"When you see a little songbird struggling to feed an enormous cowbird chick, you have to wonder why it can't recognize the parasitic chick when it is so obvious to us," said Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and coauthor of the paper. "The coot study shows that chick recognition can evolve, even when the chicks are the same species and all look the same to us." </p><p>The researchers found that coots learn to recognize their own chicks each year by using the first-hatched chicks as a template to which other chicks are compared. This learning mechanism may explain why it is so hard for chick recognition to evolve among the hosts of cowbirds and cuckoos, said Dai Shizuka, a UCSC graduate student and first author of the paper.</p><p>"Cuckoo and cowbird chicks tend to hatch before the host chicks, so their hosts can't use hatching order as a cue for chick recognition," Shizuka said. "As long as recognition has to be learned, you run the risk of learning incorrectly, and that could be the bottleneck."</p><p>These findings provide indirect support for a theory proposed by Arnon Lotem of Tel Aviv University, who attributed the absence of chick recognition in most cuckoo hosts to the high cost of mistaken imprinting. By experimentally causing mistaken imprinting in coots, Shizuka and Lyon confirmed that learned chick recognition does have potential costs. </p><p>Lotem assumed a classic imprinting mechanism that would occur only once, during the adult bird's first breeding season. Coots, however, seem to "imprint" on their first-hatched chicks each year. Coots reliably imprint on their own chicks because the first-laid eggs are the first to hatch, and parasitic eggs are deposited only in nests that already have eggs in them.</p><p>"It's not that coots are exceptionally smart. They just have reliable information that allows them to do what we expect all hosts 'should' be doing to defend themselves against parasitism," Shizuka said.</p><p>The common cuckoo and brown-headed cowbird are specialists in brood parasitism, shifting the burden of parental care onto other species rather than building their own nests. In coots, brood parasitism seems to be an optional component of a reproductive strategy based on laying large numbers of eggs. Depositing a few eggs in a neighbor's nest is just another way to increase the number of potential offspring. </p><p>The chances of survival in a neighbor's nest may be slim, but coots habitually lay more eggs than are likely to survive, Lyon said. Only in the best of years is there enough food for all of the chicks; in a typical year, about half of the chicks in each brood starve to death, he said. If a parasitic chick survives, another chick in the brood must die, which explains why coots have evolved such strong defenses against parasitism. </p><p>"We actually set out to study how coots bring their brood size into alignment with the availability of food, and what role hatching order plays in the culling process. But we kept seeing anecdotal evidence in the field that something else was going on," Lyon said. "With the parasitic chicks, they don't just let them starve, they attack them with a viciousness we hadn't seen before."</p><p>The researchers got a one-year extension to their grant, funded by the National Science Foundation, to study chick recognition at their study site in British Columbia. The experiment required removing eggs from the nests at the pipping stage (when the chick starts trying to break the shell) and hatching them in incubators. This allowed the researchers to tag the chicks and record which eggs they came from before returning them to the nests in a controlled sequence. </p><p>In one set of nests, the parents got their own chicks back on the first day. After that, chicks were returned to the nests in pairs consisting of an unrelated chick and a chick that belonged to the parents. The unrelated chicks were all siblings. In a second set of nests, the first chicks returned were not related to the parents, after which chicks were returned in pairs as in the first set of nests. </p><p>In all cases, a chick's chances of survival were highest if it was returned to the nest on the first day or was a sibling of the first chicks. If the first chicks were unrelated to the parents, the parents would favor them and their siblings and drive off their own chicks. "The parents learn the first chicks they start taking care of as their own, and base their decisions about later chicks on that," Shizuka said. </p><p>Using first-hatched chicks as the basis for recognition will be adaptive only if there is a low probability of parasitic chicks hatching first, he said. In a search of the scientific literature, Shizuka found two recent examples of birds, both in Australia, that appear to be able to recognize and reject cuckoo chicks. He said he hopes to learn more about those species and find out how they compare to coots. </p><p>The researchers also want to find out what cues coot parents use to recognize their chicks. The possibilities include smell, vocal calls, and visual cues such as plumage.

They are David Draper, professor of applied mathematics and statistics in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering; Thorne Lay, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences; and Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. </p><p>Draper was recognized "for distinguished contributions to Bayesian statistics, including the development of fundamental methodology, applications to health-care, and service to the profession." Draper employs Bayesian methods to address problems such as how to use electronic medical records to improve health care, how to assess the quality of hospitals and schools, and how to evaluate the risks of nuclear waste disposal. A fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Royal Statistical Society, he was the founding chair of the Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department and served as president of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis. He received a UCSC Excellence in Teaching Award in 2007.</p><p>Lay was honored "for sustained research using earthquakes to probe the deep structure of the Earth and for service to the global seismology community." Lay is known for his contributions to the understanding of earthquake rupture processes, the use of seismic waves to probe rock layering and properties of the deep Earth, and the development of seismological methods for monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. His extensive service on national and international committees includes terms as chair of the board of directors of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and chair of the National Research Council's Committee on Seismology. At UCSC, Lay has served as founding director of the UCSC branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), director of the Institute of Tectonics, and chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He currently directs the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth, part of the IGPP.</p><p>Millhauser was recognized "for distinguished contributions to the field of biophysical chemistry, polymer folding, prion protein function and melanocortin signaling." He studies diseases caused by abnormal proteins, using sophisticated techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the structures and functions of protein molecules. Much of his recent research has focused on the prion protein, which causes mad cow disease and the related human affliction, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. (Millhauser and Draper collaborated on a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2861">recent investigation</a> of a rare inherited form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.) Millhauser has also made important contributions to the understanding of a molecular signaling system known as the melanocortin pathway, which appears to be involved in diseases related to energy balance, including diabetes, obesity, and anorexia. </p><p>Election as a fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. This year, 531 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. New fellows will be honored at the AAAS Fellows Forum on Saturday, February 20, during the 2010 AAAS Annual Meeting in San Diego.</p><p>The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. AAAS is the world's largest general scientific society and publisher of the journal Science. AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes some 262 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving 10 million individuals. Science has the largest paid circulation of any peer-reviewed general science journal in the world, with an estimated total readership of 1 million. The non-profit AAAS is open to all and fulfills its mission to "advance science and serve society" through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, and more. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915edbfc8072704601a012ff76c8c9af"><name>3449</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>H1N1 Flu Shots Friday 1/8/10 at Student Union </title><start-date>1260946800000</start-date><display-name>H1N1 Flu Shots Friday...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3449</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3449</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339167160</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339167160</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are pleased to announce that we have a sufficient supply of H1N1 influenza vaccine, which we will administer *to registered students, faculty, and staff with a reservation*.

Now, new research suggests studying the shape of the aftermath of supernovas may allow astronomers to do the same.</p><p>A new study of images from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory on supernova remnants--the debris from exploded stars--shows that the symmetry of the remnants, or lack thereof, reveals how the star exploded. This is an important discovery because it shows that the remnants retain information about how the star exploded, even though hundreds or thousands of years have passed.</p><p>"It's almost like the supernova remnants have a 'memory' of the original explosion," said Laura Lopez, a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the study. "This is the first time anyone has systematically compared the shape of these remnants in X-rays in this way."</p><p>Astronomers sort supernovas into several categories, or "types," based on properties observed days after the explosion. Those properties reflect the very different physical mechanisms that can cause stars to explode. But since observed remnants of supernovas are leftover from explosions that occurred long ago, other methods are needed to accurately classify the original supernovas.</p><p>Lopez and colleagues focused on relatively young supernova remnants that exhibited strong X-ray emission from silicon ejected by the explosion so as to rule out the effects of interstellar matter surrounding the explosion. Their analysis showed that the X-ray images of the ejecta can be used to identify the way the star exploded. The team studied 17 supernova remnants in the Milky Way galaxy and a neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p><p>For each of these remnants, there is independent information about the type of supernova involved, based not on the shape of the remnant but, for example, on the elements observed in it. The researchers found that one type of supernova explosion--the so-called Type Ia--left behind relatively symmetric, circular remnants. Type Ia supernovas are thought to be caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf and are often used by astronomers as "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances.</p><p>On the other hand, the remnants tied to so-called core-collapse supernova explosions were distinctly more asymmetric. This type of supernova occurs when a massive young star collapses onto itself and then explodes.</p><p>"If we can link supernova remnants with the type of explosion, then we can use that information in theoretical models to really help us nail down the details of how the supernovas went off," said coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Models of core-collapse supernovas must include a way to reproduce the asymmetries measured in this work and models of Type Ia supernovas must produce the symmetric, circular remnants that have been observed.</p><p>Out of the 17 supernova remnants sampled, 10 were classified as the core-collapse variety, while the remaining seven were classified as Type Ia. One of these, a remnant known as SNR 0548-70.4, was a bit of an "oddball." This one was considered a Type Ia based on its chemical abundances, but Lopez said it has the asymmetry of a core-collapse remnant.</p><p>"We do have one mysterious object, but we think that is probably a Type Ia with an unusual orientation to our line of sight," said Lopez. "But we'll definitely be looking at that one again."</p><p>While the supernova remnants in the Lopez sample were taken from the Milky Way and its close neighbor, it is possible this technique could be extended to remnants at even greater distances. For example, large, bright supernova remnants in the galaxy M33 could be included in future studies to determine the types of supernova that generated them.</p><p>The paper describing these results appeared in the November 20 issue of <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters.</i> NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.

<p>As promised in earlier messages, I want to update you on activities related to the UCSC budget. Last Thursday our campus Planning and Budget office updated principal officers, academic Senate leaders, and student and staff representatives on California's fiscal climate and its potential impact on the 2010-11 UC budget.</p>
<p>The news was sobering. Early indicators suggest that the state may end this fiscal year with a deficit approaching $21 billion. A budget gap of that magnitude would likely lead to further cuts to state programs in fiscal year 2010-11. UC leaders are aggressively seeking over $300 million from the state to replace last year's one-time cuts. While this would mitigate further budget cuts to the campus, we must prepare for the possibility of sizeable reductions in state support next fiscal year.</p>
<p>I remain fully committed to inclusive, transparent budget planning. Last Friday, I <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2009/12/planning_2010-11.pdf">wrote</a> to all academic deans and principal officers asking them to evaluate the potential impacts of budget cuts ranging from 5.5 to 11 percent in each academic division and academic support function. I want to emphasize that these are not budget cuts assigned to units. This is a planning exercise that will help us understand the implications and risks of further cuts to already-strained campus operations. You'll be kept informed through ongoing communications from me, updates from your principal officers, and various opportunities for direct engagement and conversation.</p>
<p>While it is far too early to accurately predict the magnitude or distribution of next year's cuts, I know that the prospect of further funding reductions is dispiriting. I can assure you that we will do everything possible to maintain the integrity and quality of preparing students to make a positive impact in the world, conducting innovative research addressing the world's biggest challenges, and enhancing the quality of life in communities near and far. I hope, as we carry out our work, we can focus on how we can continue doing this work to the best of our ability with the resources we have and not only focus on resources we may lose.</p>
<p>With appreciation for your collective dedication and perseverance, I wish you and yours a peaceful and restful holiday.</p>
<p>David Kliger</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor</p>

Relatively rapid feedbacks include changes in atmospheric water vapor, clouds, and sea ice. These short-term changes probably set in motion long-term changes in other factors--such as the extent of continental ice sheets, vegetation cover on land, and deep ocean circulation--that lead to additional global warming, Ravelo said.</p><p>"The implication is that these slow components of the Earth system, once they have time to change and equilibrate, may amplify the effects of small changes in the greenhouse gas composition of the atmosphere," she said.</p><p>The researchers used sediment cores drilled from the seafloor at six different locations around the world to reconstruct carbon dioxide levels over the past five million years. They found that during the early and middle Pliocene (3 to 5 million years ago), when average global temperatures were at least 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than today, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was similar to today's levels, about 30 percent higher than preindustrial levels. </p><p>"Since there is no indication that the future will behave differently than the past, we should expect a couple of degrees of continued warming even if we held carbon dioxide concentrations at the current level," said lead author Mark Pagani, an associate professor of geology and geophysics at Yale University.</p><p>In addition to Pagani and Ravelo, the coauthors of the paper include Yale postdoctoral researcher Zhonghui Liu and UCSC graduate student Jonathan LaRiviere. The study used samples supplied by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and was funded by the National Science Foundation and supported by the Yale Climate and Energy Institute.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ee69b8072704601a012fffd5142db"><name>3456</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Astronomers Steve Vogt and Greg Laughlin were quoted in extensive media coverage of their discovery of new planets around nearby Sun-like stars ...</summary><description>Astronomers Steve Vogt and Greg Laughlin were quoted in extensive media coverage of their discovery of new planets around nearby Sun-like stars ...</description><start-date>1261119600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2009/12/3456</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2009/12/3456</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339169901</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339169901</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Astronomers Steve Vogt and Greg Laughlin were quoted in extensive media coverage of their discovery of new planets around nearby Sun-like stars, including stories in <strong><em>USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, U.S. News &amp; World Report, Science News, Scientific American, Discover</em> magazine, CBC News (Canada), BBC News, National Geographic News, Discovery News, Fox News.com, Space.com, Science Daily, ABC Science Online, Softpedia,</strong> and <strong>Slashdot.</strong></p>
