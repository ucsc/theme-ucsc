<p>Published March 1 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01403-5"><em>Nature Ecology and Evolution</em></a>, the study highlights the need to better understand and conserve variation within species in order to safeguard nature&#8217;s contributions to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biodiversity means more than the number of species, and when we focus on species-level extinctions we are missing part of the story,&#8221; said corresponding author Eric Palkovacs, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Intraspecific variation is a neglected aspect of biodiversity, but it has value for people, and we need to start recognizing that and protecting this form of biodiversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>An <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/species-variation.html">earlier study</a> led by first author Simone Des Roches, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz now at the University of Washington, showed that the loss of variation within species can have serious ecological consequences. This got Des Roches and Palkovacs thinking about the broader implications of their findings for the values and services nature provides to people, from forest materials and clean water to commercial fisheries and medicines derived from natural products.</p>
<p>For the new study, they surveyed the scientific literature for studies showing how intraspecific variation supports ecosystem services and other aspects of nature&#8217;s contributions to people. They found well documented connections across a wide variety of species, including fish and commercial fisheries, insects and crop pollination, woody plants and forestry products, many different crops and their wild ancestors, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a whole suite of documented cases, including several examples of what happens when we lose intraspecific variation,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;One of the best examples is commercial fisheries, where diverse fish stocks help to stabilize the overall population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Subpopulations of salmon, for example, are locally adapted to the conditions of different watersheds, allowing the overall population to remain stable even as environmental fluctuations cause declines in some subpopulations and increases in others. These &#8220;portfolio effects&#8221; in salmon are undermined by dams, which block subpopulations from critical spawning habitat, and by hatchery production, which can reduce genetic variation. The loss of intraspecific variation in salmon can lead to boom-bust population cycles that are detrimental to the long-term value of the fishery.</p>
<p>Des Roches noted that people have long depended on variation within domesticated and agriculturally important species. &#8220;Our coevolutionary history with hundreds of domesticated species is characterized by our continued selection for unusual and beneficial variants within species,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve often taken this too far and have thus lost critical genetic diversity in domesticated species. We depend on outbreeding with more genetically variable wild type or ancestral populations (when they exist) to restore this diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plants with medicinal value provide other well documented examples of the value of intraspecific variation, Palkovacs said. &#8220;Different varieties of the same plant species may have different compounds with different medicinal properties, such as different antimalarial drugs that depend on the genetic diversity of the plants they are derived from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors emphasized the importance of collaborating with local and indigenous groups who have deep knowledge of the relationships between intraspecific variation and the natural products and services they use. &#8220;We need to take advantage of the local knowledge systems to inform our understanding of these connections,&#8221; Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>He noted that Western science has focused overwhelmingly on species-level extinctions, and only the most well-studied groups of organisms have been characterized from the standpoint of intraspecific variation. Of all the species evaluated by the <a href="https://www.iucn.org/">International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</a>, for example, only about 1 percent have been evaluated below the species level, and many of those show precipitous declines in diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is strong evidence that the loss of intraspecific variation may be a very widespread problem, but we don&#8217;t even know what is being lost,&#8221; Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>There are practical steps that can be taken now, he said, to better document this variation, preserve biodiversity, and protect its contributions to the wellbeing of people. New genomic tools, for example, are available to quickly and systematically characterize the variation within species. This intraspecific variation can be directly incorporated into biodiversity assessments, such as those done by the IUCN and the <a href="https://www.ipbes.net/">Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing this aspect of biodiversity should be a major goal of global conservation efforts, the authors said. &#8220;The available evidence strongly suggests that the benefits of studying and conserving intraspecific variation will far outweigh the costs,&#8221; Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>He noted that variation within species is the raw material of adaptive evolution. In a rapidly changing world, this variation is critically important to enable species to adapt to the conditions of an unpredictable future.</p>
<p>In addition to Palkovacs and Des Roches, the coauthors of the paper include environmental economist Linwood Pendleton, senior vice president for science at the Centre for the 4th Industrial Revolution, and Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But lately, an on-the-ground team of testing site kiosk attendants is also being recognized for helping to keep the campus safe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than five dozen hardworking Banana Slugs are a key element of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s TestMe asymptomatic testing program, which has administered more than 56,000 COVID-19 tests of students, staff, and faculty since the project&#8217;s inception in September of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to see all those students on the front line,&#8221; said Michael Luttrell, operations and logistics manager for COVID-19 testing on campus. &#8220;Without those 62-plus Slugs working as testing site kiosk attendants, there is no way we&#8217;d be testing anywhere near as many people as we test each week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Testing, testing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TestMe&#8212;open to UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty&#8212;is designed to focus on the health and well-being of the student workers and campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kiosk attendants welcome guests at the door and make sure the test subjects don't have symptoms because testing is only open to asymptomatic students, staff, and faculty. The students check customers in on iPads. And while the subjects do their own nasal swabs, the students are on hand to make sure this is being done correctly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students follow rigorous safety protocols, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wearing face masks and standing behind sheets of plexiglass, while carefully explaining the steps to test for COVID-19: swab one nostril for 15 seconds, then the other, and then put the swab in a special solution for another 30 seconds. After a friendly exchange, the student says goodbye to the customer and the next person in line steps up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result of all that hard work is between 3,500 and 4,000 COVID tests a week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who live on campus must get COVID tests twice a week, and will continue to take required COVID tests even after vaccination. If they are living off campus but coming on site for work or research, they also must agree to twice-weekly testing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff who are teaching, holding meetings, and other activities on campus may receive up to one test a week on a voluntary basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free testing takes place at three locations on campus. The largest is at the Merrill College Cultural Center, which is open for testing Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m; Porter College&#8217;s Hitchcock Lounge, which is open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.; and College Nine&#8217;s Namaste Lounge, which is open Monday through Friday at varying times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Luttrell announced job openings for kiosk helpers, he wondered if he&#8217;d have enough workers to fill the positions. Instead, he received an outpouring of interest, with applications far exceeding the number of available slots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been overwhelmed by the student enthusiasm in this program as well as their participation,&#8221; Luttrell said. &#8220;We had 50 applicants just within the first hour, and to date, over 300 students have applied for the positions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from their hard work in the testing kiosks, those students influenced the logistics of the TestMe program, Luttrell added.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They were an integral part of developing the program and making it what it is today,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>A labor of love, with lasting impacts</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the student workers are science communication, biology, and pre-med students interested in experience relating to their fields, and also wanting to help out other students on campus, Lutrell said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy Sanchez (Stevenson '21, anthropology), one of the undergraduate kiosk attendants, took the job because of her desire to keep others safe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A part of what drew me to this job was the idea of being able to help maintain some form of structure, a first step in attempting to keep health and safety guidelines up to date and being in a position to be a role model for others during this pandemic,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s quite interesting for me to be able to work as a kiosk attendant,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Every day I bump into familiar faces. That puts me in a unique position to bring extra comfort as they come in to test, especially the Spanish-speaking staff!&#8221; (Sanchez is a bilingual English-Spanish speaker.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She likes contributing to &#8220;a little bit of normalcy&#8221; to the lives of those who come in to get tested frequently, especially those who live on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Only then, with regular testing, will they feel more comfortable doing daily tasks once they know their status&#8212;all the while continuing to practice COVID-19 safety precautions,&#8217;&#8217; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion (SHOP) team also plays a decisive role in the TestMe program. SHOP was charged with recruiting, hiring, and training the student kiosk workers.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having worked alongside this amazing team of students for over five months now, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am humbled and honored to see what they do on behalf of our community day in and day out,&#8221; said SHOP director Meg Kobe.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety came first during the rigorous SHOP-administered training program, said SHOP senior health educator Ali Hayes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our training with our student kiosk workers, we emphasized the importance of taking care of each other and how to build our team agreements around social distancing, reminding each other to wear appropriate face coverings, and utilizing hand sanitizer,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;We made a commitment to each other about all of the safety protocols in place to do this work on our campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The training program has been &#8220;a whirlwind in a good sense,&#8221; said SHOP health educator Amber Parker. &#8220;And the fact is, UCSC wouldn't be open at all if it weren't for our amazing student team. They show up every day not only to provide quick and easy COVID testing, but to create an environment that is warm, welcoming, and celebratory. If you've been tested on campus, you've been recognized by our staff for doing your part. To me, that genuine appreciation part of the testing process is really amazing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Effective program</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is efficient, providing fast results, usually within two or three days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz infectious disease expert Marm Kilpatrick has praised the testing program&#8217;s impact.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The testing program has been very effective in identifying infected people quickly and providing these people with safe isolation space that has prevented subsequent onward transmission from these cases,&#8221; said Kilpatrick, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testing program helped identify a spike in cases in early January, allowing the campus to immediately take measures to prevent its spread. The spike quickly went down, and campus health officials could not find a single case that was transmitted through the campus community. It appeared all the cases were the result of people catching it elsewhere over the holiday break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To schedule an appointment for an asymptomatic COVID screening test now, visit </span><a href="http://ucsc.edu/covidtest"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ucsc.edu/covidtest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or call the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center at (831) 459-2500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, campus testing is for people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Students who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 should </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/about/contact.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call the Student Health Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for guidance on what to do, and employees with symptoms should call their primary care provider. Anyone with symptoms should not go to an asymptomatic testing site.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f47c0ac8807270172c1b96bdc0204243"><name>in-memoriam-atharva-chinchwadkar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Atharva Chinchwadkar, Oakes College</title><summary>We are saddened to write to you with news of Atharva Chinchwadkar, an Oakes student, who was reported missing Sunday, February 21.

An analysis of the organizational structures of other UC campuses, consultation with Academic Senate and campus leadership, and a year of reflection and thoughtful consideration informed our thinking.</p>
<p>Last year Vice Chancellor for Planning and Budget Peggy Delaney retired. Peggy&#8217;s creative, committed leadership of the division for a decade elevated the stature of all the units reporting to her. This realignment is a testament to the talented teams she developed. Last spring, the Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor (CPEVC) temporarily assumed direct oversight of the units in Planning and Budget and that experience also informed the restructuring.</p>
<p>In the new organizational structure, Budget and Resource Management (BRM); Institutional Research, Assessment and Policy Studies (IRAPS); and Data Management Services (DM) will now be a part of the Office of the CPEVC. Julian Fernald, the director of IRAPS, will report directly to the CPEVC. Data Management Services, led by Director Todd Graham, and Budget and Resource Management will be part of the newly formed Budget Analysis and Planning unit. Budget Director Kim Register will lead this unit as the Associate Vice Chancellor for Budget Analysis and Planning (AVC BAP). She will report to the CPEVC with a secondary reporting relationship to Chancellor Cynthia Larive. The office of Capital Planning and Space Management (CPSM), led by Director Karen Smith, will now report to the Division of Business and Administrative Services as a unit within Physical Planning, Development and Operations.</p>
<p>These changes will help us function more effectively and efficiently as we work together toward our larger campus goals. For example, the synergies between the work carried out by Capital Planning and Space Management with Physical Planning, Development and Operations units will streamline workflows and leverage professional expertise on capital projects and space allocation decisions. In this new structure all organizations formerly within the Division of Planning and Budget will continue to work together collaboratively.</p>
<p>Improving student success, solidifying our status as a research leader, and cultivating an inclusive campus remain campus priorities. We believe this operational realignment will boost our ability to leverage our resources and work together toward achieving our campus goals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, and Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4f62f7a807270172c1b96bd483f291e"><name>mbest-speaker-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC MBEST Speaker Series and Info Sessions</title><summary>The UC MBEST Executive Committee invites you to join us for our UC Monterey Bay Education Science &amp; Technology (UC MBEST) Speaker Series featuring leading UC-affiliated and national research park and innovation district practitioners and thought leaders.</summary><start-date>1614672000000</start-date><display-name>UC MBEST Speaker Series and Info Sessions</display-name><path>/2021/03/mbest-speaker-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/mbest-speaker-series</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1614722510677</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1614722510677</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC MBEST Executive Committee invites you to join us for our <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/MBEST_Process.aspx">UC Monterey Bay Education Science &amp; Technology (UC MBEST)</a> Speaker Series featuring leading UC-affiliated and national research park and <a href="https://www.giid.org/rise-innovation-districts/">innovation district</a> practitioners and thought leaders.</p>

<h3>UC MBEST Background</h3>
<p>The University of California Monterey Bay Education Science and Technology (UC MBEST) Center is a 1080-acre site conveyed to the UC in 1994 with the closure of the Fort Ord military installation. The Fort Ord Natural Reserve was established on 605+-acres and has been functioning as a research education and collaboration asset since the late 1990&#8217;s. The remaining 475+ acres were envisioned as a home for multi-institutional education, research and industry partnerships, and eventually to take the form of a research park/innovation district. Planning for reuse has continued moving forward with installation of $15-million in roads and other infrastructure invested by the Economic Development Administration, along with the construction of the 20,000-sf UC MBEST Headquarters Building. More recently, UC Santa Cruz lead research in artificial intelligence and mobility, agricultural technology and coastal sciences, as well as major new investments by a market leading electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft manufacturer have renewed interest in the potential of UC MBEST as an innovation, entrepreneurship and industry alliances hub.</p>
<p>Chancellor Larive has charged an Executive Committee of Academic leadership to develop a strategic plan for MBEST and initiate the implementation of that plan. This speaker series is one step in that process, and is intended to raise awareness of the UC MBEST opportunity for our research and campus community, and offer insights on the process of developing research and innovation districts from local UC-affiliated and national practitioners &amp; thought leaders. Speakers will cover considerations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trends in university-affiliated research park and innovation district development;</li>
<li>Origins of their respective projects;</li>
<li>Key partners and research focus areas;</li>
<li>Involvement of academic departments/divisions;</li>
<li>Significant timelines and funding;</li>
<li>Progress to date;</li>
<li>opportunities and challenges; and</li>
<li>optimizing education to career pathways.</li>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The two will be in </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/a_fireside_chat_with_two_pioneers_in_science_sandra_m_faber_and_kathryn_d_sullivan#.YD0-gC1h31I"><span>conversation</span></a><span> Monday, March 8, with our own Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and a pioneering scientist in her own right. Sandra and Kathryn will explore their impactful careers and the influence UC Santa Cruz has had on their incredible success. Among their impressive accomplishments, Sandra co-led the largest project in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope, an undertaking that extended our view of galaxy formation back nearly to the Big Bang, while Kathryn was a member of the team that launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained the Hubble.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We also encourage you to visit the campus&#8217;s&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/womens-history-month/">Women&#8217;s History Month landing page</a> to catch up with two of the more prominent voices in health in the COVID-19 era: Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and pandemic expert Laurie Garrett and Los Angeles County&#8217;s top public health official Barbara Ferrer. Both are alums and both are doing extraordinarily important work. Later this month you can read about undergraduate Gina Schneider, a Marin County native making history as part of the nation&#8217;s inaugural class of female Eagle Scouts. The past year, meanwhile, has been a whirlwind for one recent alumna, and in a positive way. Garima Desai became UC Santa Cruz's first ever Rhodes Scholarship winner. She graduated this past spring with a double major in environmental studies and economics, and she's now continuing on a similar track at Oxford, where she'll pursue dual master's degrees. She talks about her journey to becoming a Rhodes Scholar in a recent UCSC </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ucsc-slugcast/id1552257211?i=1000510484946"><span>Slugcast episode</span></a><span>, which we&#8217;ve also linked from our Women&#8217;s History Month webpage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It&#8217;s also the ideal time for us to announce the formation of the new Campus Advisory Committee on the Status of Womxn. CACSW&#8217;s principal purpose will be to examine issues regarding the status of women staff, students, and faculty on our campus; to analyze policies, procedures, and/or programs that affect those issues; to identify model programs and to support their implementation; to recommend to the chancellor and CPEVC changes that will ensure women equal and fair access to campus programs, activities, and opportunities; and to provide a chancellor-appointed representative to serve as a member of the Systemwide Advisory Committee on the Status of Womxn. Those interested in being members are urged to visit the </span><a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/campus-advisory-committee-status-womxn.html"><span>website</span></a><span> for more information. We&#8217;re delighted to announce the committee&#8217;s formation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, we&#8217;d like to acknowledge the regular work undertaken on our campus to boost the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields. The world is increasingly driven by technological innovation, and we must increase the participation of women in STEM and also ensure they have ample opportunities to assume leadership positions. This has not always been the case historically despite evidence that diversity of experience and perspective in all fields is of deep and lasting value. </span><a href="https://wiseucsc.wixsite.com/wise"><span>Women in Science and Engineering</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>Girls in Engineering</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://ucscwocjc.wixsite.com/acounterspace"><span>ACS for BIPOC Women in Astronomy and Physics</span></a><span>, our </span><a href="https://acm-w.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>UCSC ACM-W chapter</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://societyofstemsistersucsc.weebly.com/"><span>Society of STEM Sisters</span></a><span> are among the fantastic campus programs and organizations doing the important work needed to change the face of the STEM fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We appreciate having this opportunity to share a message honoring women and showcasing the excellence of our colleagues, students, alumni, and friends. We share this message in a year when one of UC&#8217;s own, Vice President Kamala Harris, has achieved the second-highest elected position in the country. When it comes to history, the story of women has historically been one of exclusion. A month recognizing achievement doesn&#8217;t change that, but it allows us to tell and retell the stories of so many inspiring women who have changed the world for the better or who aspire to do just that.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f53a910f807270172c1b96bde96ebe1c"><name>coastal-adaptation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC leads multicampus initiative on coastal resilience and climate adaptation</title><summary>A UC-funded initiative will bring together researchers at the Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and San Diego campuses to address pressing issues for California’s coastal communities.</summary><keywords>Borja Reguero</keywords><start-date>1614780000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC leads multicampus initiative on coastal resilience and climate adaptation</display-name><path>/2021/03/coastal-adaptation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/coastal-adaptation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1614726992110</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1614782115856</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/banner-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/banner-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>banner-500.jpg</name><display-name>banner-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>63023</file-size><width>500</width><height>154</height></image><image-alt>coastal cliffs</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/banner-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/banner-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>banner-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>banner-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19571</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coastal cliffs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The new initiative brings together UC expertise in the science of coastal hazards, adaptation strategies, and coastal policy.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/borja-reguero-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/borja-reguero-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>borja-reguero-350.jpg</name><display-name>borja-reguero-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>51252</file-size><width>350</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Borja Reguero</image-alt><image-caption>Borja Reguero</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC-funded initiative will bring together researchers at the Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and San Diego campuses to address pressing issues for California’s coastal communities</article-subhead><article-text><p>Experts in coastal science and policy at UC Santa Cruz are teaming up with researchers at UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, and the U.S. Geological Survey to address the many challenges of adapting to climate change along California&#8217;s coast.</p>
<p>The UC Coastal Resilience and Climate Adaptation Initiative is one of 15 research projects funded by UC&#8217;s 2021 <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/mrpi/2021-awards.html">Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives</a> (MRPI) competition. These biannual awards are made by the UC Office of the President to support research and discoveries in fields important to UC and to the people, environment, and economy of California.</p>
<p>California&#8217;s iconic shoreline, from its communities and beaches to coastal wetlands and intertidal habitats, is increasingly threatened by coastal hazards such as extreme flooding and erosion associated with climate change, sea level rise, storms, and El Ni&#241;o events. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary, science-based approach. Practical and effective solutions are needed to help communities address the accelerating social, economic, and environmental challenges driven by climate change.</p>
<p>The new initiative will develop a targeted research strategy for UC in solutions-focused coastal science and policy. Researchers will also engage with coastal communities, organize workshops, and review local adaptation planning cases.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Borja Reguero, an associate researcher in UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> and assistant adjunct professor in the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a>, said the project provides an opportunity to build a more integrated system-wide, interdisciplinary network of UC expertise in coastal science, with the goal of informing coastal adaptation policy and decision-making in California and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project is another step to make the UC system a national and international leader in coastal science, providing a reference that can effectively inform climate change adaptation,&#8221; Reguero said.</p>
<p>The project leverages multidisciplinary expertise at the three UC campuses and the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc">USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center</a>, including UC expertise in the physical, ecological, and socio-economic dimensions of coastal zones in a changing climate. The participation of the USGS center will advance collaboration and connections in coastal science between UC and the federal government.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the strengths of this project is the integrated approach, combining expertise in coastal science and policy,&#8221; said Adam Young at the <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>The team will review the current understanding of coastal hazard impacts and the strengths of UC campuses, convene scientific experts, and coordinate with communities and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The UC MRPI pilot award provides $280,000 over two years, including support for graduate student researchers. The initiative will support other seed projects and cultivate dialogue between students, coastal scientists, decision-makers, and communities at risk. The outcomes will inform solutions driven by local needs and contexts.</p>
<p>&#8220;California has a legacy of coastal protection, but climate change and sea level rise presents a daunting and existential challenge to so many things we love&#8212;our amazing beaches, rich wetland systems, and vibrant coastal communities,&#8221; said Charles Lester, director of the <a href="https://msi.ucsb.edu/research/research-centers/ocean-and-coastal-policy-center">Ocean and Coastal Policy Center</a> at the Marine Science Institute at UC Santa Barbara and former executive director of the California Coastal Commission. &#8220;This project is an opportunity to bring physical and social science together to help California stay resilient in the face of climate change, so that all Californians can continue to live, enjoy, and thrive along our coast.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Some, like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Pakistani human rights and education advocate Malala Yousafzai, have become household names and reached veritable celebrity status.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Jessica Taft, a leading expert in youth activism from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Latin American and Latino Studies Department, has been watching this development closely. Back in 2011, Taft published a </span><a href="https://nyupress.org/9780814783252/rebel-girls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about girl activists, and at the time, girls were largely invisible in both academic literature and public discourse, despite their long history as leaders in social movements. Now, things are different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fifteen years ago, when I would tell people that I studied girl activists, they&#8217;d say, &#8216;Are there girl activists?&#8217;,&#8221; Taft recalled. &#8220;No one says that to me anymore. There have been girl activists this whole time. It's just that suddenly we're now noticing them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Taft sees opportunity in the increasing visibility of girl activists, she also sees many troubling trends in the ways they&#8217;re being portrayed by the media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a paper published by the journal </span><a href="https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/girlhood-studies/13/2/ghs130203.xml"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girlhood Studies</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Taft performed an extensive analysis of written, English-language media accounts to identify themes in articles about girls&#8217; activism. In particular, she honed in on coverage of some of the most prominent leaders, like Thunberg, Yousafzai, American gun-control advocate Emma Gonz&#225;lez, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, Palestian resistance leader Ahed Tamimi, and Chilean political organizer Camila Vallejo.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taft found that many of the narratives around these and other girl activists fell back on counterproductive stereotypes that may actually undermine the effectiveness of these young leaders, even as they are seemingly being celebrated. For example, Taft says that girls are often presented as symbols of hope, who will build a brighter future. But part of the appeal of this narrative is that it invites adults to let go of their own concerns and responsibility around societal problems by pinning their hopes for the future on youth.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Girls are being set up as the ones who are going to do all of the work, and that lets adults off the hook for creating a world in which we can all survive,&#8221; Taft said. &#8220;That&#8217;s yet another burden upon girls, and that seems profoundly unfair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This image of girl activists as heroic saviors was another theme that emerged from media representations. And, aside from lulling adults into a false sense of security, this trope encourages the public to place the responsibility for social change on a few exceptional individuals, rather than on governments and other systems of power. It also fundamentally misrepresents how social movements function.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The daily practice of social movements and the ways that movements are actually effective is not because of an individual celebrity,&#8221; Taft said. &#8220;It&#8217;s because of many unknown people, usually women and people of color, who are doing the everyday work of mobilizing communities, sharing resources, and building organizations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taft says the media focus on heroism makes it harder for the average person to imagine themselves getting involved in social movements, which is often exactly what girl activists are actually calling for. Ironically, part of what obscures this message is that girls are simultaneously thought of as both heroic and, ultimately, harmless, which makes it easier to dismiss their ideas, demands, and political visions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older girl activists, like Camila Vallejo, are also frequently sexualized in media accounts, and public perceptions show clear racial biases too. While the most celebrated public figures tend to be young white girls, Black girls are more often portrayed as troublesome or threatening for exercising their agency. And all girls, like other youth activists, sometimes struggle to get their messages across because media narratives are so caught up on the supposed novelty of youthful leaders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taft&#8217;s analysis&#8212;particularly around how gender, race, age, and nationality interact in media portrayals of girl activists&#8212;demonstrates that the harmful trends in media coverage are a reflection of deeper cultural problems. But the overall increase in media coverage also shows that these representations can change and evolve, which means they have potential to improve.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Part of that will require really situating girl activists within their communities of struggle, and we need to emphasize the actual content of their politics,&#8221; Taft said. &#8220;A lot of that is about how we perceive young people. Our perceptions are still really rooted in this adultist idea of them being less capable. It&#8217;s a matter of checking that impulse and asking ourselves what we can actually learn from these young people.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f957d97e807270172c1b96bd8fc9f187"><name>abbaszadeh-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Shiva Abbaszadeh wins Tracy Lynn Faber Memorial Award</title><summary>The award from the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging supports the advancement of women in medical imaging sciences.</summary><start-date>1614758400000</start-date><display-name>Shiva Abbaszadeh wins Tracy Lynn Faber Memorial Award</display-name><path>/2021/03/abbaszadeh-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/abbaszadeh-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1614796020065</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1614796355117</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/shiva-abbaszadeh-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/shiva-abbaszadeh-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shiva-abbaszadeh-300.jpg</name><display-name>shiva-abbaszadeh-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>60845</file-size><width>300</width><height>316</height></image><image-alt>Shiva Abbaszadeh</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/shiva-abbaszadeh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/shiva-abbaszadeh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shiva-abbaszadeh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>shiva-abbaszadeh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19809</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Shiva Abbaszadeh</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Shiva Abbaszadeh</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The award from the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging supports the advancement of women in medical imaging sciences</article-subhead><article-text><p>Shiva Abbaszadeh, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the Tracy Lynn Faber Memorial Award from the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) for her outstanding contributions to high-resolution direct-conversion radiation detectors for medical imaging applications.</p>

<p>The OpenEye award program provides funding for up to four outstanding tenure-track junior faculty members to present their work in the COMP division at the Spring 2021 ACS National Meeting, which will be held online. The highly competitive awards are intended to identify junior stars in the field and to assist new faculty members in gaining visibility within the COMP community.</p>
<p>Ping&#8217;s research focuses on developing and employing advanced theoretical and computational techniques to solve problems related to energy conversion and quantum information science. Her research group uses theoretical and computational methods to understand and predict the properties of complex materials, including optical, spin, electron transport, and catalytic properties at the atomic levels.</p>
<p>Current research topics include electronic excitation and spin dynamics, polaronic conduction in complex oxides, and catalytic reactions at solid-liquid interfaces. The aim is to tightly connect theoretical and computational predictions with experimental observations by identifying important theoretical questions whose answers will eventually provide guidance to experiments and suggestions for new materials with superior functional properties.</p>
<p>Ping received her B.S. in chemical physics at the University of Science and Technology of China and her Ph.D. in physical chemistry at UC Davis. She joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fa5fd10a807270172c1b96bdda88b1cc"><name>kelp-forests-norcal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The collapse of Northern California kelp forests will be hard to reverse</title><summary>Most of Northern California’s kelp forest ecosystem is gone, replaced by widespread ‘urchin barrens’ that may persist long into the future, according to a new study.</summary><keywords>Meredith McPherson, Raphael Kudela, Mark Carr</keywords><start-date>1614942000000</start-date><display-name>The collapse of Northern California kelp forests will be hard to reverse</display-name><path>/2021/03/kelp-forests-norcal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/kelp-forests-norcal</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1614813319402</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1615233732526</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/kelp-canopy.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/kelp-canopy.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kelp-canopy.jpg</name><display-name>kelp-canopy.jpg</display-name><file-size>109924</file-size><width>507</width><height>352</height></image><image-alt>satellite images of coast</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/bull-kelp-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/bull-kelp-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bull-kelp-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bull-kelp-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18332</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>bull kelp and fish</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Satellite images show the dramatic reduction from 2008 to 2019 in the area covered by kelp forests (gold) off the coast of Mendocino and Sonoma Counties in Northern California.

Species-rich kelp forests have been replaced by &#8220;urchin barrens,&#8221; where purple sea urchins cover a seafloor devoid of kelp and other algae.</p>
<p>A new study led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz documents this dramatic shift in the coastal ecosystem and analyzes the events that caused it. This was not a gradual decline, but an abrupt collapse of the kelp forest ecosystem in the aftermath of unusual ocean warming along the West Coast starting in 2014, part of a series of events that combined to decimate the kelp forests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01827-6">Published March 5 in <em>Communications Biology</em></a>, the study shows that the kelp forests north of San Francisco were resilient to extreme warming events in the past, surviving other strong marine heatwaves and El Ni&#241;o events. But the loss of a key urchin predator, the sunflower sea star, due to sea star wasting disease left the kelp forests of Northern California without any predators of sea urchins, which are voracious grazers of kelp.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were a lot of disruptions at one time that led to this collapse, and the system now persists in this altered state,&#8221; said first author Meredith McPherson, a graduate student in ocean science at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s a naturally dynamic system that has been really resilient to extreme events in the past, but the die-off of sunflower stars caused the resilience of the ecosystem to plummet. As a result, the kelp forests were not able to withstand the effects of the marine heatwave and El Ni&#241;o event combined with an insurgence of sea urchins.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Satellite imagery</strong></p>
<p>The researchers used satellite imagery from the U.S. Geological Survey&#8217;s Landsat missions going back to 1985 to assess historical changes in kelp forest canopy cover.</p>
<p>Bull kelp is the dominant canopy-forming kelp species north of San Francisco Bay, while giant kelp is dominant to the south. Both species thrive when strong upwelling of cold, deep water brings nutrients to the surface along the coast. Marine heatwaves and El Ni&#241;o events suppress coastal upwelling, resulting in warm water and low nutrient conditions in which kelp grows poorly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been big changes before, when a strong El Ni&#241;o has reduced the kelp canopy dramatically, but in the past it&#8217;s always come back,&#8221; said coauthor Raphael Kudela, professor and chair of ocean science at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The loss of resiliency is what made this time different&#8212;the combination of ocean warming and the loss of the sea stars allowed the urchins to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sea star wasting disease first appeared in 2013, affecting all types of sea stars along the West Coast. The sunflower sea star was among the hardest hit species and was recently was listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
<p>Late 2014 saw the advent of an unusual marine heatwave in the Northeast Pacific which became known as &#8220;the blob&#8221; as it spread down the West Coast in 2015. A strong El Ni&#241;o event began to develop around the same time, bringing warm water up the coast from the south. The warm water coincided with an increase in sea urchin populations along the North Coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The alignment of all of those events resulted in an incredibly dramatic loss of kelp,&#8221; Kudela said.</p>
<p><strong>Urchin predators</strong></p>
<p>Kelp forests declined all along the California coast, but not to the same extent as in Northern California. Bull kelp is an annual species that regrows each year, which may make it more sensitive to these stressors than giant kelp. But another critical difference in Northern California is the absence of other urchin predators such as sea otters, which have enabled patches of healthy kelp forest to persist in Monterey Bay, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sea otters haven&#8217;t been seen on the North Coast since the 1800s,&#8221; McPherson said. &#8220;From what we observed in the satellite data from the last 35 years, the kelp had been doing well without sea otters as long as we still had sunflower stars. Once they were gone, there were no urchin predators left in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>What that means for the future, she said, is that the prospects for recovery of the Northern California kelp forests are poor unless sunflower sea stars or some other urchin predator returns to the system. Even if temperature and nutrient conditions are good for kelp growth, new kelp plants will have a hard time getting established in the midst of the urchin barrens.</p>
<p>There have been some efforts to have divers manually remove urchins from selected areas and see if that can help the kelp to recover, led by the <a href="https://www.reefcheck.org/california-program/">Reef Check California Program</a> (which contributed subtidal survey data for the study). An outbreak of sea urchin disease could also potentially lead to mass mortality of urchins and give the kelp a chance to recover. In the absence of some mechanism to reduce the urchin populations, however, it will be hard to restore and maintain the kelp forests, according to McPherson.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of research and discussion now about the best management strategies for the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand and monitor the whole system. If we&#8217;re going to undertake restoration efforts, we need to make sure to do it when the temperature and nutrient conditions are right for the kelp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kudela said ocean temperatures are beginning to cool down along the coast, after remaining above normal since 2014. &#8220;This year we are finally seeing ocean temperatures starting to cool off, so we&#8217;re hoping that it reverses naturally and the kelp is able to take off again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s really not much we can do except to keep monitoring it. Of course, the long-term solution is to reduce our carbon emissions so we don&#8217;t have these extreme events.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since 2014, however, California&#8217;s kelp forests have declined dramatically, and vast areas of the coast where kelp once thrived are now &#8220;urchin barrens,&#8221; the seafloor carpeted with purple sea urchins and little else. This has occurred even in Monterey Bay, which hosts a large population of sea otters.</p>
<p>In 2017, UC Santa Cruz graduate student Joshua Smith set out to understand why.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in Monterey Bay, we now have a patchy mosaic, with urchin barrens devoid of kelp directly adjacent to patches of kelp forest that seem pretty healthy,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;We wanted to know how did this sea urchin outbreak happen where there are so many otters, how did the otters respond, and what does that mean for the fate of kelp forests here on the Central Coast?&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with a team of sea otter researchers at UCSC, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Smith conducted intensive underwater surveys along the Monterey Peninsula over a span of three years. The study built on decades of long-term monitoring of sea otter populations and kelp forest ecosystems along the California coast.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s findings, published March 8 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, tell a fascinating story of how the behavioral responses of predators and prey to changing conditions can determine the fate of an entire ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Wasting disease</strong></p>
<p>It began in 2013 with the outbreak of a mysterious disease called sea star wasting syndrome, which decimated sea stars all along the West Coast. Among the hardest hit species was the sunflower sea star (<em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em>), a major sea urchin predator. But according to Smith, that was just one factor leading to a massive outbreak of sea urchins.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe several factors initiated the urchin outbreak,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The loss of a major urchin predator was soon followed by a decline in kelp productivity due to climatic stressors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In kelp forests, sea urchins mostly occupy crevices in rocky reefs on the seafloor where they are protected from predators. Pieces of kelp drift down onto the reef like falling leaves in a forest, delivering food directly to the urchins in their shelters.</p>
<p>Kelp thrives where cold, nutrient-rich water wells up along the coast from the ocean depths, and giant kelp (the dominant species on the Central Coast) can grow more than a foot per day in good conditions. In 2014, however, an unprecedented marine heatwave hit the Northeast Pacific. Known as &#8220;the blob,&#8221; it spread over the West Coast from Alaska to Central California. Around the same time, a major El Ni&#241;o event brought warm water up the coast from the south.</p>
<p>With all that warm water bathing the coast, kelp growth rates dropped dramatically. That meant less kelp detritus drifting into the crevices of the reefs, and sea urchins began to emerge in search of food. With no sea stars around to attack them, the urchins mowed down the living kelp fronds, turning kelp forests into urchin barrens.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened so fast, before we knew it we had lost over 80 percent of the historic kelp forest cover in Northern California,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;We also had an urchin outbreak on the Central Coast, but not to the same extent as in the areas north of San Francisco.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sea otters</strong></p>
<p>Smith and his colleagues found that sea otters on the Central Coast responded to the urchin outbreak by increasing their urchin consumption dramatically, eating about three times as many sea urchins as they had prior to 2014. Thanks to an abundance of prey (including an increase in mussels as well as urchins), the sea otter population increased substantially after 2014, from about 270 to about 432 sea otters in the Monterey region at the southern end of Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Yet the urchin barrens remained. A close look at sea otter foraging behavior explained why. Smith&#8217;s team found that the otters were feeding on urchins in the remaining patches of kelp forest, but not in the urchin barrens.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to see from shore where they are diving repeatedly and coming up with sea urchins,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The dive team surveyed those places, as well as areas not being targeted by otters, and collected urchins to examine in the lab. The researchers found that urchins from the kelp beds had much higher nutritional value than those from the urchin barrens, with large, energy-rich gonads. In the barrens, however, the urchins are starved and not worth the effort to a hungry otter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people call them zombie urchins,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;You open them up, and they&#8217;re empty. So the otters are ignoring the urchin barrens and going after the nutritionally profitable urchins in the kelp forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>By doing this, the sea otters are helping to maintain those patches of healthy kelp forest, which are now crucially important for the persistence of giant kelp along the coast. Spores produced from those remaining patches could eventually reseed the barren areas and restore the kelp beds.</p>
<p>Sea otters alone, however, won&#8217;t disrupt the urchin barrens. Some other factor is needed to clear enough urchins from the barrens to enable new kelp plants to grow there. Smith said another predator could help knock down the urchin population, or a disease, or even a major storm bringing large, bottom-scouring waves. Some groups are even exploring human interventions, sending teams of volunteer divers out to remove sea urchins in an effort to restore the kelp forests.</p>
<p><strong>Regional differences</strong></p>
<p>Mark Carr, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said the differences between kelp forests on the southern, central, and northern coasts of California are striking. Carr, who is Smith&#8217;s adviser but not a coauthor of the <em>PNAS</em> paper, has been studying kelp forests all along the West Coast for years. He said Southern California&#8217;s kelp beds did not decline to the extent seen on the central and northern coasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference in Southern California is that even though they lost the sea stars, they have other predators like the spiny lobster and California sheephead that are able to control urchin populations and allow the kelp forests to persist,&#8221; Carr said.</p>
<p>Northern California&#8217;s kelp beds, in contrast, have fared much worse. The absence of sea otters north of San Francisco may be a factor, but it&#8217;s hard to say because the dominant species of canopy-forming kelp is different, with bull kelp <em>(Nereocystis leutkeana)</em> dominant in the north and giant kelp <em>(Macrocystis pyrifera)</em> dominant on the central and southern coasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that the presence of a healthy sea otter population in the north might have made those kelp forests more resilient, but it&#8217;s hard to speculate,&#8221; Carr said. &#8220;The role of a predator can be very different depending on where you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pioneering studies of sea otters and kelp forests conducted in the Aleutian Islands by James Estes, now a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, showed that as the sea otter population in the Aleutians recovered from near extinction, the otters transformed urchin barrens into kelp forests as they recolonized islands. But those interactions are playing out differently on the Central Coast, and could have yet another outcome in Northern California.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study not only fine tunes our understanding of the role of sea otters in kelp forests, it also emphasizes the importance of animal behavior,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;So much of this is driven by behavior&#8212;the urchins shifting their behavior to active foraging, and the otters choosing to prey on healthy urchins in the kelp forest&#8212;and these behavioral interactions have implications for the overall fate of the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/">Student Health Services</a> (SHS) switched to delivering many of its services through telehealth and rapidly built up its COVID-related support, which included hiring a nurse dedicated to overseeing COVID cases and working closely with UCSC leaders in the campus response.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/hand-sanitizer.html">Pharmacy staff started making hand sanitizer</a>, and four COVID testing sites were set up across campus with staffing supervision from the Summer Conferences team. Student Health Outreach and Promotion (SHOP) employees also trained <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/test-me-feature-story-dw.html">more than 60 student workers to staff the testing sites</a>, while SHS staff from case management, nursing, nutrition, and others, along with the workers&#8217; compensation manager, took on the critical job of contact tracing and transferring students quickly to isolation and quarantine spaces.</p>
<p>The result: Low positivity rates. Zero on-campus transmission. Fast testing turnaround times. For these reasons and many others, UC Santa Cruz is leading the way in efficient coronavirus response compared to its university counterparts.</p>
<h3>Testing lab: a community partner</h3>
<p>Another notable success in its work for campus and the entire Santa Cruz community is the university&#8217;s <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/molecular-diagnostic-lab">Molecular Diagnostic Lab</a> (MDL), which opened in May 2020 in response to the pandemic. The MDL hired professional staff and lab scientists to support day-to-day testing for the university and worked with SHS to design the sample collection kiosks that allow for twice-per-week testing of asymptomatic students, as well as voluntary testing of faculty and staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so proud of our faculty, staff, and students who have stepped up to serve our campus and our local community, building on the university&#8217;s transformative research and resources to establish a COVID&#8211;19 testing lab,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;UCSC&#8217;s work has been critical to serving our students and staff as well as the underserved populations in our county who need it most.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the urgent need arose for greater access to testing early in the pandemic, the MDL, with the Community Foundation Santa Cruz County&#8217;s support, began to process specimens for the two largest community clinics in the county, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/07/covid-testing-partnerships.html">Santa Cruz Community Health and Salud Para La Gente</a>. The MDL also began providing test results for other high-risk populations in the community, such as the Santa Cruz County Jail and the Santa Cruz County Probation Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is in crisis, we care about the community, and we wanted to do our part to change the testing landscape,&#8221; said Director Isabel Bjork. &#8220;It was very much a shared interest, and all of us volunteered our time on top of our other full-time positions to make this dream a reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the pandemic spread, testing lagged, with some sites taking a week or more to deliver results. The campus team has taken pride in providing results in 24&#8211;48 hours while expanding its capacity. The lab now processes an average of 1,000 tests a day. The lab was honored with a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/difference-award.html">&#8220;Be the Difference&#8221; Award</a> for its work last fall by the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center.</p>
<h3>Workplace preparedness</h3>
<p>When public health guidelines for COVID&#8211;19 rapidly changed, the Risk and Safety Services department led the campus response. Managers and staff in the Office of Emergency Services, Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EHS), and Risk Services pivoted to support essential workers on campus by distributing more than 31,000 pieces of COVID supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE), hand sanitizer, and disinfectant.</p>
<p>This effort was supported by the purchasing, stores, and other staff in Physical Planning, Development &amp; Operations (PPDO), and the team conducted COVID-related workplace assessments and did online training on safety practices for at-home employees to reduce virus transmission. Members of this team also helped implement the campuswide signage program, including the &#8220;Slug Strong&#8221; awareness campaign, and implemented heightened standards for cleaning and sanitizing workspaces throughout the campus.</p>
<h3>Vaccines, helping campus residents</h3>
<p>The university recently began administering COVID vaccinations, putting more than 2,000 shots in UCSC employees&#8217; arms to date. In the near future, UCSC will transition to working with the county to inoculate more of the campus population through their healthcare providers and local pharmacies as part of the state&#8217;s vaccination efforts.</p>
<p>UCSC has also been fortunate enough to have had <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/">lower positivity rates</a> than the rest of the county. Several protective measures, including the decision to delay students coming back to campus in spring 2021, and transitioning to a rolling move-in, seem to have helped curb on-campus virus transmission to date.<img alt="" height="333" src="images/vaccine-500px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" width="500"/></p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, Colleges, Housing and Educational Services (CHES) had the necessary job of rethinking housing density, cleaning, and health protocols to accommodate 800 residents in fall 2020 and 1,300 residents in winter 2021 in single-occupancy residence hall rooms and single- and double-occupancy apartments. Residents are asked to sequester for two weeks at home before coming to campus and for two weeks upon arrival, and the university implemented a badge system and symptom checker to monitor residents&#8217; health.</p>
<p>CHES also created a quarantine and isolation program with wraparound student support. Quarantine housing limits contact between someone who may have been exposed to the virus to others in the community, while isolation housing refers to those who are COVID-positive and showing symptoms and need to live separately. The department created a brochure to demystify this process for students and let them know that they would be comfortable and supported in quarantine or isolation.</p>
<p>The campus made space for isolation and quarantine housing in the Village and other residential facilities across campus. The residents receive meal delivery by UCSC Dining, the spaces are cleaned and sanitized by custodial staff who received specialized training, and students receive support for their academic and personal well-being. The rooms are also equipped with a PPE kit: a thermometer, face covering, gloves, and hand gel. There are now 220 isolation spaces available on campus in case of a surge.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid an increase in cases such as those that followed the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, the campus is encouraging students not to travel for spring break.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realize students may have a desire to travel, but we are asking them to reconsider their plans and have a <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/quarter-breaks/index.html">staycation</a> with us on campus,&#8221; said Housing Services Executive Director Dave Keller. &#8220;We are planning fun spring break events, such as outdoor movie nights and spring break destination&#8211;themed dining, like Cancun Night and Lake Havasu BBQ Night.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A sense of belonging</h3>
<p>College Student Life staff have been working hard to provide a sense of belonging on campus through online and remote programming. For example, when students enter into quarantine/isolation housing, they get assigned a &#8220;quarantine buddy,&#8221; a staff member at their home college. The staff member will check in regularly with the student to be a point of contact, see how they&#8217;re doing, see if they need anything, and provide comfort or resources as needed.<img alt="masked-students-500px.jpg" height="333" src="images/masked-students-500px.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" width="500"/></p>
<p>Students also have a staff coordinator who makes contact with students when they need to enter into quarantine/isolation housing. They work on transportation and food coordination, and they work with each student on their unique needs. <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS)</a> is also working with students struggling with the stress of COVID, remote learning, isolation, and maintaining good mental health during a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s safe to say we all miss being able to gather in groups and look forward to that time again. Until then, we&#8217;ve learned to utilize social media platforms to advertise and share live events,&#8221; said Alex Belisario, interim executive director of college student life. &#8220;Colleges have college government meetings via Zoom, we&#8217;ve had our first remote College Night, there are movie screenings, virtual speakers, arts and crafts, and larger-scale day-long conferences. The goal is to provide space for and create community.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0484b959807270172c1b96bdab1db203"><name>student-housing-west</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Focused on student success and equity, UC Santa Cruz seeks reapproval to build more housing and child-care facilities</title><summary>In an effort to provide students with more housing security amid an unrelenting housing crisis, UC Santa Cruz will seek reapproval for a project that will significantly increase the number of current students who are able to live on campus. </summary><start-date>1614988800000</start-date><display-name>Housing update</display-name><path>/2021/03/student-housing-west</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/student-housing-west</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1614983510284</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1615223772790</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/students-campus-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/students-campus-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>students-campus-500px.jpg</name><display-name>students-campus-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>390067</file-size><width>500</width><height>346</height></image><image-alt>Students on campus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/students-campus-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/students-campus-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>students-campus-80px.jpg</name><display-name>students-campus-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>19726</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students on campus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The housing shortage in Santa Cruz has only grown more urgent, both because of the summer wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and the increasing number of people deciding to move to Santa Cruz because they can work remotely.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Student Housing West offers the best route to creating more affordable housing for students and reducing housing pressure in the local community</article-subhead><article-text><p>In an effort to provide students with more housing security amid an unrelenting housing crisis, UC Santa Cruz will seek reapproval for a project that will significantly increase the number of current students who are able to live on campus.</p>
<p>Following a detailed, 18-month evaluation of <a href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/">Student Housing West</a> in the midst of legal challenges to the project, Chancellor Cynthia Larive <a href="chancellor-student-housing.xml">said she is confident the project offers the most rapid and direct route to creating more housing</a> for undergraduate students and graduate students. Housing equity is a foundation for student success, one of the campus&#8217;s highest priorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care about our students from the moment they enroll in classes and throughout their entire life,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;The lack of housing locally and the exorbitant cost of what is available is challenging for our students, particularly those who are from low-income backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<div class="callout-right narrow">
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Student Housing West offers the most direct route to creating much-needed affordable housing for UC Santa Cruz students.</li>
<li>The project will reduce housing pressure in the community by allowing an additional 2,000 existing students to live on campus.</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz will be able to expand child care to serve the children of employees in addition to students.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Student Housing West, with a certified EIR, is the only viable path forward to address the urgent need for near-term, affordable and dependable student housing for the existing student population and to support the campus in closing the equity gap among students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is known for its transformative undergraduate educational experience that&#8217;s rooted in its residential colleges. Prior to the pandemic, UC Santa Cruz was housing about 9,300 students, more than half of its undergraduate students.</p>
<p>With some exceptions, most undergraduates are unable to continue living on campus during their third and fourth years. Student Housing West will offer a variety of housing accommodations and allow upper division students to continue living on campus, instead of seeking housing in the local community.</p>
<p>Student Housing West will allow the campus to offer more housing to its graduate students and upper-division undergraduates by building new housing units with space for more than 3,000 students. The project is spread across two sites at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Land at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge roads will be used to build a new housing community for students with families and a new early childhood education center that will serve the children of faculty and staff in addition to students. The site is across the street from existing employee housing, near Westlake Elementary School, and near the campus&#8217;s main entrance. If the project is approved, the campus is hoping to start construction as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the new housing community is built, UC Santa Cruz will be able to tear down the aging buildings currently home to students with families so that the campus can build six new buildings that will provide housing for approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and 220 graduate students.</p>
<p>While nearly all UC Santa Cruz students have been learning through remote instruction since the pandemic began a year ago, campus leaders are planning to resume more in-person activities this fall.</p>
<p>The housing shortage in Santa Cruz has only grown more urgent, both because of the summer wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and the increasing number of people deciding to move to Santa Cruz because they can work remotely.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will seek reapproval for the project from the UC Board of Regents during its March meeting. The project was first approved two years ago, though lawsuits prevented the campus in meeting its original timeline to build more housing.</p>
<p>A Santa Cruz County judge in October 2020 upheld UC&#8217;s detailed environmental review of Student Housing West. The project underwent a thorough analysis, underscoring the campus&#8217;s commitment to the environment. The judge also concluded errors were made in the process the Regents used when they approved the project.</p>
<p>In addition to focusing on the environment in determining where to build Student Housing West, the project itself will advance the campus&#8217;s long-standing commitment to sustainability. The project includes solar panels as well as a water recycling facility that will allow UC Santa Cruz to reuse wastewater for non-potable uses, such as flushing toilets and irrigation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="04a2d6b9807270172c1b96bd441bb859"><name>rat-island</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Return to Rat Island: Conservation strategy leads to ecosystem rebound</title><summary>Hawadax Island's birds and seashore ecosystem have returned to a natural balance after the removal of invasive rodents.</summary><keywords>Carolyn Kurle, Donald Croll, Bernie Tershy, Island Conservation</keywords><start-date>1615212000000</start-date><display-name>Return to Rat Island: Conservation strategy leads to ecosystem rebound</display-name><path>/2021/03/rat-island</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/rat-island</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1614985483930</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1615218580325</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mario Aguilera (UCSD) &amp; Tim Stephens (UCSC)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/rat-island-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/rat-island-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rat-island-410.jpg</name><display-name>rat-island-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>62325</file-size><width>410</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt>Rat Island</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/survey-gear-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/survey-gear-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>survey-gear-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>survey-gear-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19593</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Carolyn Kurle</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carolyn Kurle first conducted surveys on Rat Island (now Hawadax) as a UCSC grad student in 2008, when non-native rats dominated the island ecosystem.

The resilient rodents, which are known to be among the most damaging invasive animals, adapted and thrived in the new setting and eventually overwhelmed the island ecosystems, disrupting the natural ecological order and driving out native species.</p>
<p>A coordinated conservation effort that removed the rats from one of the islands formerly known as Rat Island has become a new example of how ecosystems can fully recover to their natural state in little more than a decade. The ecological rebound at newly named Hawadax Island (a return to the original Aleut name meaning &#8220;the island over there with two knolls&#8221;) extended from land to the island&#8217;s interconnected marine community. Results of a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84342-2.epdf?sharing_token=9hBzYyVTqOX52tCU5ulaItRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Oaivj-2YSxUDYkBcrYeEE2RMVsI8fSQrnOsEVi2myGFjMX_G4Ref1ZoIUvHcZY9mnEhZXJMIx4QCa_nREu7rj236S4UifX5mTWWwP6HY4LwXV6ffp3hulii5puOe0Z7fs%3D">published in <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em></a> document the remarkable recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised that the level of recovery unfolded so quickly&#8212;we thought it could be longer,&#8221; said lead author Carolyn Kurle, an associate professor of biological sciences at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz working with professors Donald Croll and Bernie Tershy, Kurle had <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1981.html">documented the disruption of the island&#8217;s ecosystems in a study published in 2008</a>. Croll, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Tershy, adjunct professor in the same department, are also coauthors of the new paper, along with researchers at <a href="https://www.islandconservation.org/">Island Conservation</a>, the nonprofit organization they founded nearly 25 years ago, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/alaska_maritime/">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS), and the Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study confirms the profound impacts of introduced species like rats across entire sensitive island ecosystems, while at the same time demonstrating the remarkable conservation benefits of their removal,&#8221; Croll said.</p>
<p>Kurle has taken part in research expeditions to more than 35 of the islands in the Aleutian chain, most of which are managed by USFWS as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. She and her colleagues conducted surveys at Hawadax in 2008 when the invasive rodents dominated the island ecosystem. As a new, direct predator to native island species, the rats unleashed a cascade of disruption for the island&#8217;s food chain. They preyed upon shore bird eggs and chicks, which nearly wiped out the island&#8217;s breeding shorebird population. Without birds consuming herbivorous seashore invertebrates such as snails and limpets, the island&#8217;s intertidal plant-eaters flourished, significantly driving down the abundance of the marine kelp.</p>
<p>To reverse these effects, a coordinated conservation strategy to save the native species on Hawadax removed the rats in 2008. The effort presented a rare case in which researchers were able to compare ecosystem data from surveys during rat dominance with a recovering ecosystem five years later and a fully recovered system after 11 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t often get the opportunity to return to a remote location and collect data after the fact,&#8221; said Kurle, who noted that the researchers also compared the survey data with naturally balanced ecosystems on neighboring islands that had never been occupied with rats. &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to say that a conservation action had any sort of impact, but in this particular case we took a conservation action that was expensive and difficult, and we actually demonstrated that it worked. But we didn&#8217;t expect it to be so fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the rats removed at Hawadax, the seabirds returned and are again consuming the seashore invertebrates, which has allowed the recovery and rebound of the kelp community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Invasive rats are almost always direct predators of native animals when they become introduced on islands,&#8221; said Kurle. &#8220;So when the birds returned, it led to an entirely different structure in the marine community on this island. It now has a structure that more closely resembles what we observe on islands that have never had rat invaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers say more studies that focus on understanding and measuring both direct and indirect impacts of invaders, and how interconnected communities respond following removal of those impacts, are needed to underscore the broad conservation successes associated with invasive species eradication, especially on islands.</p>

The project was approved by Regents two years ago but then challenged in court. We prevailed on many issues, but the court concluded errors were made in the process the Regents used when they approved the project, requiring us to return to the board.</p>
<p>We already house 50 percent of our students, more than any other University of California campus, because we know that access to a UC Santa Cruz education requires access to secure and affordable housing. There just isn&#8217;t enough of that in and around Santa Cruz and there certainly aren&#8217;t enough housing options for our students from low-income backgrounds. Student Housing West is the best course for us to secure the most beds to serve our current students. We haven&#8217;t built a significant amount of housing on the UC Santa Cruz campus in nearly 20 years. It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>The benefits of Student Housing West will be many. Studies show that students who live on campus have a greater chance of matriculating through to graduation. This project will draw upper-division undergraduates now living in the community back to campus, giving them a secure, affordable housing option while also easing pressure on the local housing market. The project will allow us to reduce overcrowding in existing dorms and restore some of the lounge space we have converted to sleeping space in recent years to meet the steep housing demand. It will create a new residential community for students with families, situated within walking distance of the local elementary school and near the residential communities where we house our staff and faculty. It will aid our campus community in other ways, too, finally enabling us to offer faculty and staff child-care support that is currently available only to students with children.<img alt="" height="223" src="images/child-bubbles-500px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" width="300"/></p>
<p>I encourage you to visit the <a href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/">Student Housing West website</a>, which details the project. There is an <a href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/information/faqs/">FAQ section</a> for those new to campus who might have questions.</p>
<p>The Student Housing West project does not enjoy unanimous support. Some of our strongest campus supporters have opposed the project, particularly the portion proposed for the base of the East Meadow, arguing that the area should remain untouched. I have welcomed, valued and considered their opinions.</p>
<p>I was not chancellor when Student Housing West was proposed. That has granted me the opportunity to look at the project with fresh eyes. Over the past 18 months I have studied it and listened to and asked questions of many in our community &#8212; project supporters and critics &#8212; with an eye toward meeting the project objectives while also satisfying the concerns of all of our stakeholders. There is no simple answer, but the proposed project fulfills our shared values: to support our students and to be a good partner to our community.</p>
<p>I have come to understand that building anywhere on our campus is a tightrope walk. We live, work and learn in a stunning natural setting. Regardless of where we build, there will be impacts and opposition. I believe strongly that Student Housing West, as approved by the Regents in March 2019, is the best path for us to deliver more desperately needed quality housing for our students as quickly as possible and at the lowest possible price. The price tag is important because the cost of a more expensive project would be borne largely by students. Housing is an auxiliary unit that cannot be funded centrally through state funds or tuition.</p>
<p>The housing crisis in our community is not going away. It has only worsened since the Regents first gave this project their stamp of approval. In August of this past year, the CZU Lightning Complex fires destroyed nearly 1,000 homes in Santa Cruz County. Exacerbating the problem, we&#8217;re now seeing Silicon Valley employees who are working remotely buying up homes on this side of the hill, deciding working from home here is much preferred to settling down in the Santa Clara Valley. Many UC Santa Cruz students and their families, meanwhile, have been hit hard economically by the pandemic, and many will return to campus in an even more difficult financial position.</p>
<p>We cannot just talk about our values. We must live them. The proposed Student Housing West project exemplifies our values as well as the values of our community and our founders. It is a project that honors our past, addresses our present student housing needs, and will serve the needs of our students and our employees well into our future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="136bbdb4807270172c1b96bddad92aa8"><name>undocumented-support-initiative</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing New Undocumented Student Support Initiative</title><summary>I am pleased to announce the launch of a new initiative, an 18-month campus program to enhance structural supports for undocumented students to thrive on campus and beyond, and to strengthen relationships between undocumented students, staff, and faculty at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1615190400000</start-date><display-name>Undocumented Student Support Initiative</display-name><path>/2021/03/undocumented-support-initiative</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/undocumented-support-initiative</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1615233531288</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1615233568557</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am pleased to announce the launch of a new initiative, an 18-month campus program to enhance structural supports for undocumented students to thrive on campus and beyond, and to strengthen relationships between undocumented students, staff, and faculty at UC Santa Cruz.&#160; Our goal is undocumented students&#8217; liberation from any form of social oppression, including on our campus. The initiative will begin in April 2021 with the onset of spring quarter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Program Overview:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program will engage with UCSC students, faculty, staff, alumni and other partners to a) discover needs and strengths in the UCSC community regarding the experiences of undocumented students, b) develop trust and rapport for collaborative and affirming working relationships to sustain long-term change and institutional transformation, and c) provide consultative support to UCSC community members </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as they work in community with students and other community members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop programs, policies, and implement strategies aimed at strengthening the structures that support undocumented students in their academic and personal pursuits at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning team for this initiative will include students, representatives from EOP, Undocumented Student Services, Dean of Students, the Resource Centers, our Divisional team, and the three consultants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Program Consultants:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This initiative will be done in partnership with three Latinx-identified immigrants who are currently or formerly undocumented, have doctoral-level training in psychology, and have been involved in addressing undocumented immigrants&#8217; concerns through campus-based advocacy, community organizing, clinical practice, academic research, and policy activism. The consulting team has extensive experience in developing institutional and national training programs, and in providing consultation to university units, hospitals, and organizations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a team that is highly versed in knowledge and understanding of intersectionality of multiple identities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Germ&#225;n A. Cadenas (He/El), assistant professor of counseling psychology at Lehigh University</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Laura P. Minero (She/Ella), postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liliana Campos (She/Ella), doctoral intern at the University of California Davis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germ&#225;n, Laura, and Liliana have done incredible work in their respective areas and are excited to provide valuable insight and guidance during the course of this initiative. They are already contributing to making our campus more undocufriendly. In December, they led a workshop for our entire Division of Student Affairs and Success, where they introduced us to strategies for healing ethno-racial trauma in working with undocumented immigrants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Seeking Student Collaborators:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeking students who are interested in engaging in the early planning phases of this initiative in spring and summer 2021. The student participants will receive a stipend in recognition of their work in the planning process.&#160; We invite students to express interest by filling out this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WZ6KiIrb-UEdJs1QaXx7MhDxCtXXb7Po2Ac2LY_HgY0/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Staff members may also nominate a student to participate.&#160; Please respond by Friday, March 12th if interested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Division will also be identifying a student coordinator to help guide this project throughout the 2021-2022 academic year via the </span><a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/professional-career-development-program-pcdp/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Career Development Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PCDP). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PCDP provides qualified students who are NOT currently eligible for federal funding an opportunity to receive a $4,200 scholarship and gain professional skills and career development under the guidance of a mentor.&#160; Updates will be shared soon when the recruitment process for this program begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Division will keep the community apprised of progress on this initiative at this</span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/student-spotlight/undocumented-student-initiatives/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website.&#160; </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please check back regularly for updates. Thank you in advance to everyone that will be coming together to engage in this vital work. I am committed to to this work and am confident that if we come together in this way we will be able to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide the services needed for the health, wellness, and success of undocumented students on our campus.</span></p>

Now researchers have used a powerful chemical analysis tool to identify a small molecule produced by the bacteria that appears to play an important role in their colonization of the light organ.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/12/2/e03637-20">published March 9 in the journal <em>mBio</em></a>, adds a new wrinkle to scientists&#8217; understanding of the chemical signaling involved in this iconic symbiotic relationship. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting that there are still new things to discover, even in such a well-studied system,&#8221; said corresponding author Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian bobtail squid is a small nocturnal squid, about the size of a thumb, that lives in shallow coastal waters, hiding in the sand during the day and coming out at night to hunt for small shrimp and other prey. The bioluminescent glow from its light organ is directed downward and adjusted to match the intensity of light from the moon and stars, eliminating the squid&#8217;s shadow and masking its silhouette. This &#8220;counterillumination&#8221; strategy helps conceal the squid both from bottom-dwelling predators and from its own prey.</p>
<p>A juvenile bobtail squid is completely free of bacteria when it first hatches, but within hours its light organ becomes colonized by a very specific type of bacteria called <em>Vibrio fischeri</em>. The baby squid enters an environment teeming with thousands of kinds of bacteria and millions of bacterial cells per milliliter of seawater, of which only a tiny fraction are <em>V. fischeri</em>. Yet only those specially adapted bacteria are able to take up residence inside the light organ.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very elegant symbiosis,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;We already knew that not all strains of <em>V. fischeri</em> are the same&#8212;some are better colonizers than others&#8212;and we wanted to know if that&#8217;s being determined by chemical signals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanchez&#8217;s lab uses a technique called imaging mass spectrometry, which allows researchers to directly visualize the spatial distribution of all kinds of molecules in a sample, such as a squid specimen or a bacterial colony. Most techniques for seeing where specific molecules are in a sample involve labeling the targeted molecules. But imaging mass spectrometry allows untargeted investigations&#8212;in other words, you don&#8217;t have to know what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to visualize the chemistry in an organism,&#8221; Sanchez explained. &#8220;With imaging mass spectrometry, we are directly detecting the chemicals, and we know where in the sample they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The small molecule identified in this study is a type of diketopiperazine (DKP), a large family of cyclic dipeptides. This particular DKP&#8212;cyclo(d-histidyl-l-proline), or cHP-3&#8212;was directly detected in the light organs of the colonized squid. It was also produced more abundantly by strains of <em>V. fischeri</em> that showed increased biofilm formation, which correlates with colonization ability. And finally, supplementing bacterial cultures with cHP-3 led to a concentration-dependent increase in bioluminescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that it is produced during the first few hours of colonization when the symbiosis gets established, and we also know that it influences bacterial luminescence, and bioluminescence and colonization are tied together,&#8221; Sanchez said.</p>
<p>The results indicate that cHP-3 is an important chemical signal specific to this symbiosis, but the researchers have not yet determined exactly what its role is or the details of its interactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on that now. We don&#8217;t know the mechanisms involved, but there&#8217;s a lot more going on than we thought there was,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;The next steps for us are to find the gene cluster that produces it, and to find how widely used it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Sanchez, the coauthors of the paper include researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Until last year, he headed operations for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Conference Services.</p>
<p>But when the world abruptly shut down a year ago because of the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic, all conferences were canceled. Like everyone else, he had to swiftly change gears. Within a few months, he found himself starting a brand new job: operations manager for the university&#8217;s <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html">COVID&#8211;19 testing services</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t on my radar,&#8221; he said about joining the medical field. But he rose to the challenge and said he has enjoyed meeting and working with a whole different group of people in Student Health Services.</p>
<p>He oversees a staff of 62 students, who have been trained to help facilitate testing of asymptomatic students. The students welcome, check-in and provide testing materials like swabs and vials to students, faculty and staff who then administer their own tests.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t been easy. Not only did he have to figure out how to run a brand new operation, he had to do it in the midst of mammoth wildfires. He, his wife and their then 1-year-old daughter had to evacuate from their Boulder Creek home for 39 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been an interesting year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The first testing site launched in September in the student health center parking lot with a test run of staff volunteers. Since then, the program has slowly expanded with sites in the Namaste Lounge at College Nine, the Merrill Cultural Center, and the Hitchcock Lounge at Porter College. The sites provide 3,500&#8211;4,000 tests per week and then turn them over to the campus diagnostic lab, which gives back results in one-to-three days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hit the ground running and have moved forward by trial and error,&#8221; Luttrell said.</p>
<p>Though most classes are still online, the campus is home to 1,500 students, including those living in family housing and residence halls. They are required to be tested twice a week. Normally there would be about 9,300 students living on campus.</p>
<p>Luttrell said he wasn&#8217;t nervous about working with COVID&#8211;19 testing because he was confident with the procedures put in place by the University&#8217;s Risk and Safety Services and Student Health Services. He said he was glad to leave remote working and get back to campus. &#8220;It was nice seeing our campus community, seeing students and seeing staff on campus that I hadn&#8217;t seen for a few months.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, the asymptomatic student testing operation has conducted roughly 40,000 tests with 103 coming back positive. The .25 percent positive rate is &#8220;extremely low,&#8221; Luttrell said.</p>
<p>Luttrell anticipates that he will continue to working on coordinating testing through the fall, when the university hopes to bring back more students in a situation that will likely include a mix of online and in-person classes. He said he is grateful to be able to help with the effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been different but it&#8217;s been inspiring ,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This whole thing, from the pandemic through the fires, seeing how resilient our campus community is is a blessing.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19789caf807270172c1b96bd71eb634c"><name>covid-vaccination-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on COVID-19 vaccination distribution</title><summary>The COVID-19 vaccination distribution model continues to shift throughout the state as Blue Shield implements the new statewide framework</summary><start-date>1615276800000</start-date><display-name>Update on COVID-19 vaccination distribution</display-name><path>/2021/03/covid-vaccination-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/covid-vaccination-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1615335038095</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662576252774</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>The COVID-19 </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615405413517000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxJB8q9RXx7h2ir0TH1KXuxDF8Pw" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vaccination distribution model</span></a><span> continues to shift throughout the state as Blue Shield implements the new statewide framework. This has changed the number of doses that the campus has been able to receive through the University of California distribution model that we outlined in our prior campus vaccine update and in the last COVID-19 forum. Below is a summary of the latest vaccine updates for UC Santa Cruz employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>MyTurn and Vaccine Eligibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz employees are eligible to receive a vaccine under Phase 1B of the State of California&#8217;s</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615405413517000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuun1ho-ymW2rYuNCB5TPOGrnglQ" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>vaccine allocation guidelines</span></a><span>, which includes those working in education. We encourage you to sign up for </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615405413517000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUdaZ2FBJMZOgSMDYEwN1X-dPtqA" href="https://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>MyTurn</span></a><span>, the state website where you can register to check your eligibility and find a vaccine location with available appointments in your area. You will be asked several questions on the website, including the business/industry in which you work. If you have previously logged into MyTurn, you will note the site continues to be updated. Not all vaccine clinics have transitioned yet to MyTurn. Though individuals working in education are eligible to get a vaccine under Phase 1B, not all clinics have appointments available yet for this sector. The MyTurn site will identify county vaccination clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies that are serving the education sector. For those of you in Santa Cruz county, the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615405413517000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhXZRhaOo0_ufY9itOIV4l0dQOgw" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Health Services Agency vaccine site</span></a><span> is also a resource for information. You can also check with your health care provider about vaccine availability.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Employment Verification</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The approach for verification of employment differs across counties and clinics. UC Path now gives employees the ability to print an employment verification form, though depending on the clinic, verification requirements could differ. To print an employment verification, you can log into the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucpath.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615405413517000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGL-hEWFz2_Dk2YJd_VN1l1mKUzxA" href="https://ucpath.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>UC Path portal</span></a><span> and in Employee Actions, select &#8220;Income and Taxes,&#8221; and then &#8220;Verification of Employment.&#8221; You will be able to choose a &#8220;Generate Summary Report&#8221; option to download your verification statement.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Limitations of Campus Clinic Vaccine Distribution</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the last few weeks, our campus has not received any new first doses through the UC system, and we do not anticipate receiving additional first doses from them for the foreseeable future.&#160; We have received minimal doses from Santa Cruz County as they work to vaccinate individuals who meet the state Phase 1B criteria, which includes those working in education. However, we do not know if we will receive additional first doses from the county.&#160; </span><span>We do anticipate receiving second doses for those who received their first doses from the campus and are planning accordingly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As the status of our campus vaccine clinic changes and as the state continues to implement the new distribution model, we will update you. Thank you for your continued patience as we all navigate the rapidly changing vaccination landscape in our state and community.&#160;</span></p>

NASA&#8217;s <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">Perseverance rover</a>, for example, needs heaters to keep the rover&#8217;s battery system from freezing in Martian temperatures averaging about -81 F (-62 C).</p>
<p>A new study led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and UC Merced reports the development of 3D-printed porous carbon aerogels for electrodes in ultralow-temperature supercapacitors, which could reduce heating needs for future space and polar missions.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c04780">Published March10 in <em>Nano Letters</em></a>, the study builds on <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/supercapacitors.html">previous supercapacitor research</a> by corresponding author Yat Li and his collaborators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-temperature energy storage devices could be useful for NASA missions and other applications,&#8221; said Li, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The heating components incorporated in energy storage devices to enable low-temperature operations add extra weight and need constant electric power, so we wanted to see if we could improve low-temperature device performance through structural engineering of electrodes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers 3D printed a porous carbon aerogel using cellulose nanocrystal-based ink, then freeze-dried it and further treated the surface. The resulting material had multiple levels of pores, from 500-micron pores in the lattice-like structure to nanometer-sized pores within the bars of the lattice. This multi-scale porous network preserved adequate ion diffusion and charge transfer through an electrode at -94 F (-70 C), achieving higher energy storage capacitance than previously reported for low-temperature supercapacitors.</p>
<p>This collaborative work between UCSC and UC Merced was funded by NASA through the <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/">Merced nAnomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing (MACES) center</a> and by the U.S. Department of Energy. The team will collaborate with NASA scientists to further characterize the device&#8217;s low-temperature performance.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita of Astronomy and Astrophysics Sandra Faber, and astronaut and oceanographer Kathryn Sullivan (Cowell &#8217;73, Earth sciences) met for a good-humored, informal, and revelatory &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFM8lrq0Zmo">fireside chat</a>&#8221; this week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was a high-profile way to publicize the naming of two interactive, high-tech floors in the newly renovated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science &amp; Engineering Library in their honor: the Sandra M. Faber Floor (third floor) and the Kathryn D. Sullivan Floor (first floor), thanks to naming gifts from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their far-ranging discussion, Faber talked about the ins and outs of repairing the Hubble telescope, and Sullivan discussed the fine art of space walking and descending to the ocean&#8217;s deepest depths; she&#8217;s the first woman to reach the Challenger Deep, a spot seven miles beneath the ocean&#8217;s surface. She's also the owner of three Guinness World Records titles, including one for being the first person to visit both outer space and the deepest point on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most importantly, the talk, moderated by Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Professor Beth Shapiro, offered endless inspiration for women in the audience who are pursuing STEM careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's no job that a woman has not done in the astronaut corps now from Space Station command to Space Shuttle command,&#8221; noted Sullivan, who noted that astronaut Peggy Whitson spent an astonishing 665 days in outer space, holding the U.S. duration record for time in orbit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A library for the future</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Websters&#8212;major UC Santa Cruz donors&#8212;had a particular vision for this most recent gift.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was the Websters&#8217; wish to name the library floors in honor of these women who broke glass ceilings before the term &#8216;glass ceiling&#8217; even became&#160; popular,&#8221; said University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell during the fireside chat. &#8220;Our amazing honorees and speakers Sandra Faber and Kathryn Sullivan forged an incredible path in male-dominated professions years ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project is part of a renovated Science &amp; Engineering Library that hosts advising, tutoring, and student support services in a place where students already gather, making it easier to find mentorship and take advantage of student success resources alongside library services, in addition to state-of-the art technology, Cowell said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two separate celebrations of these honors will be held in person after COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandra M. Faber Floor floor renovation project was finished early in the winter quarter of last year. The project expanded seating capacity to 440 in a mix of individual and group study spaces, and improved access to power and the wireless network.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students were using and enjoying this interactive space for a brief period before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The floor includes a large &#8220;laptop bar&#8221; with lavish backdrops featuring detailed photographs of space. The Kathryn D. Sullivan Floor will have an oceanographic theme. The centerpiece of the floor will be the Digital Scholarship Innovation Studio (DSI), where students will have access to a broad array of 3D creation tools and expert assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library will also expand its physical collections capacity by about 30% by installing new compact shelving similar to what has been in McHenry Library since 2008. The project is currently under development, and is expected to be ready for use by this upcoming winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><strong>Highs and lows&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talk was a rare opportunity for audience members to ask these distinguished speakers questions about their long careers. One of the Zoom attendants got right to the point: How would Sullivan compare and contrast space walking to exploring the ocean&#8217;s deepest depths?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan became the first woman in the United States to walk in space in 1984. In 2020</span><strong>,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she became the first woman to reach the deepest point in the ocean.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan said that those adventures had just one thing in common: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can't be in either of those environments without a very well engineered craft that gives you the kinds of conditions we need (for human survival). The marvels of engineering are essential to both of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the big differences are stark right away,&#8221; Sullivan continued. &#8220;When you go into space you've gone from the atmospheric pressure that we're all sitting in here now to zero. Outside the little sphere that you&#8217;re sitting in, you&#8217;re riding a bomb to get into orbit, so it&#8217;s just as explosive and intense as that phrase would suggest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, &#8220;a submersible into the deep sea is a very serene four-hour elevator to the bottom,&#8221; Sullivan remarked. &#8220;From orbit, you can see about 100 miles from the spacecraft window. In the deep sea you can only see as far as the lights that you brought with you will allow, which is usually about 30 feet. And you see critters all the way down. In space, the only critters are the ones that are with you in the spacecraft when you go into orbit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Busting down the door</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shapiro asked both scientists about their experiences with sexism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I certainly have encountered issues over gender,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;But I have an irrepressible desire to speak up all the time. As a result, I&#8217;m not [sheepish] about coming forward. I just speak up, and people have paid attention, for which I'm very grateful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faber recalled the glaring sexism she experienced as a graduate student at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County and at Mt. Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles. At Palomar, she was barred from an area that was informally called the Monastery, sending a "no women allowed&#8221; message. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stay in the Monastery for obvious reasons so I slept on the gatekeeper&#8217;s sofa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when she became the first female staff member at Lick Observatory in the '70s, her experience was much different.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First of all, the big barrier that I faced by virtue of gender was that I got pregnant right away,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;And so I had to deal with being an assistant professor and a pregnancy at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Faber said the reaction of Lick Observatory Director Robert P. Kraft was &#8220;incredibly wonderful. He said, &#8216;We don&#8217;t have any policies, so therefore, what I&#8217;m telling you is, take as much time as you need, and we will ask no questions whatsoever.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan said she&#8217;d led &#8220;a blessed life&#8221; in terms of not having to deal with gender-based barriers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Earlier pioneers went before me," said Sullivan. "The doors to some of the fields I was going into&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t say they were wide open, but they weren&#8217;t nailed shut, either.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Sullivan spoke of relatively minor irritations, such as getting some pushback from men on research ships where the men had grown used to &#8220;doing whatever they want, whatever that might be&#8212;you know, tell raunchy jokes, burp, or hang around in their underwear&#8212;be little boys again, and now there&#8217;s going to be a woman here to make them feel more self-conscious about that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Unforeseen challenges&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience members wanted to know about the biggest challenges that Sullivan and Faber had faced in their careers. Both of them have had to deal with complex problem-solving in high-pressure situations. Faber mentioned her essential&#8212;and highly stressful&#8212;work contributing to the optical design of the Keck Telescopes and leading the construction of the multi-object DEIMOS spectrograph for the Keck. Faber and Jon Holtzman also played a major role in diagnosing Hubble's optical flaw and executing the subsequent repair.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervising the spectrograph construction and diagnosing some early technical problems was &#8220;the hardest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing I ever did&#8221; because of the huge learning curve, she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had never built an instrument before; I knew very little about optics," Faber said. "I knew nothing about mechanical design or anything like that, and I was the head of this team &#8230; I take my hat off to the brave souls among our astronomy folk who devote their entire lives to making instruments that the rest of us observe with&#8212;I did it once and it almost killed me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faber has taken on and surmounted many other formidable challenges in her career. She is one of the leaders worldwide in the study of galaxies, with an enduring legacy of contributions across a wide range of topics in galaxy structure, galaxy evolution, and cosmology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Assessing risks&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about her own personal challenges, Sullivan went into detail about the risks she took by going into space. Sullivan rode on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 13th flight of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the sixth trip for the Challenger, two years before seven astronauts died when the Challenger blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Sullivan knew four of the crew members, so the tragedy hit home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In shuttle missions, &#8220;there is an irreducible risk that is never going to be zero,&#8221; Sullivan said, regarding the tragic accident. &#8220;If anything, that confirmed that for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the undeniable risk of going into space, Sullivan said, &#8220;it's human beings doing things no humans have done before, so they will make errors of omission and commission.&#160; And I weighed that out and decided this makes sense to me not for fame and not for fortune, but in terms of the potential value to humankind and the value to my country, and the opportunity to serve my country. That was the value.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Future plans&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of these science pioneers have nothing left to prove. But Faber and Sullivan still have dreams and grand ambitions for the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sulivan would love one more ride in space, if such a thing could be arranged. &#8220;And if the moon happened to be involved," she said, "I wouldn&#8217;t object.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faber dreams of having an Earth Futures Institute at UC Santa Cruz. The project&#8212;involving a collaboration with UC Riverside&#8212;is currently in the conceptual phase.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new entity is designed to focus world attention on &#8220;the existential question of Earth&#8217;s future on the time scale of decades to a million years,&#8221; according to the project&#8217;s website. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding is a serious challenge, &#8220;but if I could wave a magic wand and have a wish, we would have an Earth Futures Institute at UC Santa Cruz, and we would be addressing the most&#8233; important questions in the history of the human race,&#8221; said Faber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Faber is celebrating the renovated floors that have been named in her and Sullivan&#8217;s honor. &#8220;I am so pleased that my name is going to be associated with a part of this beautiful building,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The floor has been decorated and graced with many wonderful astronomical images, and you can look out at the redwoods. It&#8217;s food for the soul.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFM8lrq0Zmo</url><title>Watch the video: A fireside chat with two pioneers in science, Sandra M.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montenegro de Wit&#8217;s research focuses on the intersection of agroecology, food sovereignty, and biotechnology. But this past year, she undertook a new project to document the role of the food system in the pandemic and explore how lessons from the abolition movement could position agroecology to bring about transformative change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We've all lived through an extraordinary set of circumstances in the last year: the COVID-19 pandemic, racial upheaval, and the broad recognition of systematic violence against Black Americans, people of color, and the poor,&#8221; Montenegro de Wit said. &#8220;It became apparent to me that there were a lot of intersections between the abolition movement and social movements for agroecology and food sovereignty, and it inspired me to try and put these pieces together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her findings are now published in </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2020.1854741?src=recsys"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal of Peasant Studies</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The paper kicks off with a literature review exposing the underlying factors in our food system that have fueled the coronavirus pandemic and other dangerous diseases, like swine flu, avian influenza, and Ebola.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, habitat encroachment from industrial agriculture removes natural buffer zones that traditionally prevented spillover of pathogens from wildlife. Meanwhile, dense concentrations of animals in unsanitary conditions at factories and feedlots allow disease to spread rapidly. And replacing habitats with vast crop monocultures reduces biological diversity toward a similar end.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, concentration of power in the current food system&#8212;through oligopolies and vertical integration&#8212;makes supply chains vulnerable and allows corporations to exploit workers. Both phenomena have been on display during the coronavirus pandemic, and communities of color are most likely to be affected by resulting food insecurity or unsafe working conditions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of these reasons, Montenegro de Wit says it&#8217;s time for a dramatically different approach to food systems. And the coronavirus pandemic should be a global wake-up call.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope there's awareness that COVID-19 is not going to be the last pandemic we face; it's going to be one of many,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We must completely change the paradigm of food production, not just in the US, but around the world, in order to contain the emergence of future pandemics.&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agroecology could offer solutions. Practices like polyculture and intercropping could increase the variety of crops produced, and animals could be raised on the land in ecologically beneficial ways, instead of through overcrowded, polluting factories. Agroecology strategies promote biological diversity, which makes it harder for a pathogen to spread through any one host population.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But promoting these types of alternative food production practices will require taking on entrenched systems of power. So Montenegro de Wit looked to racial justice and abolition movements for parallels from the fight against the prison-industrial complex.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Agroecology is going to struggle to gain traction and scale out to become the dominant way of growing food and feeding people unless we're also serious about abolishing the agro-industrial complex,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The agro-industrial complex has to go, or it's not going to be possible to nurture an alternative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important lesson that Montenegro de Wit says agroecologists should learn from abolitionists is recognizing the difference between steps toward real structural change and mere adjustments that uphold the status quo. She says the agroecology movement should focus on defining &#8220;non-negotiables&#8221; around what needs to change in our food system, and one of these demands must be justice for people of color.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montenegro de Wit says there are still gaps in agroecology around explicitly acknowledging the role of racism in capitalist food systems, but that is changing, and she hopes to be part of that change through her work. Agroecologists are increasingly building relationships with communities of color and grassroots food and farm justice organizations, and Montenegro de Wit&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/926"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has focused on how researchers can engage community partners with accountability, reciprocity, humility, and solidarity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In bringing people together and joining communities that often are siloed across urban and rural boundaries, we can actually recognize that they have shared commitments and shared ideas about building a better world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s so exciting to me. It's that kind of thing that I want to carry forward, and it definitely is going to affect my future work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

and civic happiness?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>How do Shakespeare&#8217;s speakers think out loud about values and ends? And how does Shakespeare think through his characters about matters of meaning?</span></p>
<p><span><i>How to Live Like Shakespeare </i>is a new series of eight lunchtime conversations about passages in Shakespeare's plays that explicitly reflect on different aspects of human experience and the human condition. These key passages have been specifically selected for what they reveal about life and living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Co-hosted by <strong>Sean Keilen,</strong> professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz and director of UCSC Shakespeare Workshop, and <strong>Julia Lupton,</strong> professor of English at UC Irvine and co-director of the New Swan Shakespeare Center, the <a href="https://uci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEkce-vqD0iHtCbkY4XHO3yu3IkrnxV2L5Y">virtual series</a> will run from April 5 to May 24.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The title of the series is a gesture to the way that Shakespeare represents human life in his plays and to the idea that his wisdom, in this sense, might be a resource for deciding how to live now,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;Note that his wisdom is a resource, not an apology, a jeremiad, a manifesto, or a rule book for any particular doctrine about the good life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Keilen noted that Shakespeare was a wide reader, steeped in the wisdom literature of ancient Mediterranean cultures and the Bible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The series will explore what he made of that diverse material--how it influenced his perception of human beings as passionate creatures who are endowed with reason and burdened with mortality; and also how it informed his approach to human life as a struggle not only to achieve happiness and self-knowledge, but also to reconcile personal fulfillment with one's responsibilities to other people,&#8221; said Keilen.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Shakespeare's questions about these topics are the starting points for discussion,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The series' goal is a common pursuit of wisdom that embraces literature and the humanities as resources for discerning how to live well, no matter who you are or what good or bad fortune comes your way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The themes addressed in the series</strong> will include Imagination, Friendship, Fortitude, Empathy, Justice, Forgiveness, Hope, Courage, and Thinking&#8212;covering all of the genres in which Shakespeare wrote: comedy, history, tragedy, and lyric.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Each of the passages that we have&#160;chosen for the series focuses on one of the topics that we will discuss,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;For example, on the topic of Thinking, we'll look at a soliloquy from <i>Richard II</i>, in which the deposed and imprisoned king asks, &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; As he works through the speech, he realizes what a difficult question it is to answer, because all of the familiar landmarks that gave him a sense of self (crown, queen, army, realm, etc.) have been taken away. Richard is only capable of unsparing self-reflection once he is no longer distracted by his social rank and wealth. So an obvious question that arises from the passage is whether the capacity to think about oneself critically is worth the kind of losses that Richard suffers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Keilen added that in a different session, on the topic of Forgiveness, they will read and discuss Shakespeare&#8217;s Sonnet 120. In that lyric, the poet addresses a friend who has done him wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;As he tries to work out how to reconcile with him, he discovers that it is fruitless to talk about having the power to forgive other people, as if the person who has been wronged is in a categorically different position from the person who has done the wrong,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;Instead, he seizes on the idea that the basis for forgiving another person is a clear acknowledgement of one's own fallibility and propensity to harm others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;That is a more radical idea than it may sound, and judging by the way we talk about each other on social media, it is totally out of fashion now,&#8221; Keilen added. &#8220;I hope that in this session, we will use Shakespeare's sonnet as a starting point for a conversation that asks a few questions that speak to the circumstances of our polarized society: What is the nature of forgiveness (Who is in a position to ask or to give forgiveness? Is it a privilege or a duty?); Are certain kinds of harm unforgivable and would forgiving them perpetuate harm's ill effects?; And why do we find it so unappealing to reconcile with the people we have come to see as adversaries rather than friends?&#8221;</span></p>

There is danger in the open ocean, however, and the seals must avoid becoming prey themselves as they hunt fish and squid to regain the weight they lost during months on the beach with only one short foraging trip between nursing and molting.</p>
<p>A new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz shows that the elephant seals take more risks early in the migration when their stores of body fat are lowest, and change their activity patterns strategically as their body condition improves. With more fat on their bodies, the seals increasingly prioritize safety over feeding.</p>
<p>The study, published March 17 in <em>Science Advances</em>, is the first to continuously measure changes in behavior relative to body fat, resolving a decades-old question about how wild animals balance risks and rewards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Theory predicts that fat animals take fewer risks, but it&#8217;s very difficult to measure body condition continuously in wild animals,&#8221; said first author Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our results show that fat seals prioritize safety, and skinny seals prioritize feeding.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6,000-mile migration</strong></p>
<p>The researchers outfitted 71 adult female northern elephant seals with satellite tags and time-depth recorders, which allowed them to track the seals&#8217; movements and diving patterns. The migration covers about 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) across the North Pacific Ocean. Throughout this journey, the elephant seals travel in an uninterrupted series of dives, averaging 23 minutes per dive with just 2 minutes at the surface to breathe between dives.</p>
<p>For elephant seals, the surface waters are a dangerous place where they are most vulnerable to attacks by sharks and killer whales, so they minimize the time spent at the surface. Sharks and killer whales are visual predators, so elephant seals are safer at night and in the depths where light doesn&#8217;t penetrate. The result is what Beltran and her coauthors call &#8220;lightscapes of fear&#8221; that shape animal behavior in the open ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know a lot about predator-prey dynamics in the open ocean because there are so few sightings of attacks, but we regularly observe elephant seals on the beach with shark bites,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>Tracking data reveal several different types of dives, including foraging dives, when the seals swim down and pursue prey at depth; transit dives with no feeding activity; and rest dives, when they drift passively at the bottom of the dive and are presumably sleeping.</p>
<p>The drift dives enabled the researchers to calculate how much body fat the seals had based on their buoyancy in the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives us a nearly continuous record of how fat they are, which is unparalleled for any wild animal other than elephant seals,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;At the beginning of the migration, they are really skinny and they sink through the water column. As the feeding migration progresses, they slowly gain weight and their buoyancy becomes less negative until, at some point, they switch to positive buoyancy and stay positive for the rest of the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nighttime feeding</strong></p>
<p>Elephant seals do most of their feeding at night, when their prey are closer to the surface. Their rest dives tend to be in the early morning around sunrise, after a long night of foraging.</p>
<p>The timing of those rest dives changes, however, as the seals&#8217; body condition improves. Seals in poor body condition started their drift dives just after sunrise, whereas seals in good condition started their drift dives just before sunrise. As a result, the proportion of rest occurring during daylight decreased from 80 to 30 percent.</p>
<p>During drift dives, when they are presumably sleeping, the seals are especially vulnerable, making it safer to rest at night, before sunrise. But that means giving up some prime foraging time. Elephant seals feed during the day, too, but they have to dive deeper and their foraging is less efficient. With the best foraging and the safest resting times occurring at night, the seals have to choose between competing priorities.</p>
<p>As their body condition improved throughout the migration, drift dives occurred progressively earlier with respect to sunrise, indicating a shift in their priorities from feeding to safety. Seals in good body condition also started their drifts at greater depths. This makes sense considering that a fat seal drifts upward toward the sunlit surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light is a fundamental environmental constraint that these animals are using strategically to maximize rewards and minimize risks,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;In the ocean, light is an interesting way to look at risk-reward tradeoffs because it integrates time and space, especially for a migratory species that travels across time zones and latitudes with constantly changing day lengths.&#8221;</p>
<p>This study was a collaborative effort based on data acquired through the long-running UCSC elephant seal research program led by coauthor Daniel Costa, distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services (CHES),</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most undergraduate and graduate students living on campus this spring have indicated that they will stay over the break this year, primarily due to travel restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet the demand, campus officials have been busy planning activities to keep Slugs engaged, including themed dining nights, &#8220;staycation explorations,&#8221; scavenger hunts, and recreational activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On campus with us is the best place you can be right now, and we want to make the experience enjoyable for our students,&#8221; said CHES Chief of Staff Jim Grove.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that they are. Check out a few of UCSC&#8217;s &#8220;staycation&#8221; offerings:</span></p>
<h3>Dining destinations</h3>
<p><a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu/special-hours/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Dining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been busy cooking up plans for its themed dining nights, based on popular spring break destinations. Dining guests will be able to enjoy a &#8220;Lake Havasu BBQ,&#8221; complete with your BBQ favorites; &#8220;Hawaiian Holiday,&#8221; filled with traditional Hawaiian and luau dishes; and &#8220;Island Hopper,&#8221; with seafood-inspired dishes, such as ceviche bowls and jalapeno-lime shrimp. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Dining is also offering meals at a reduced cost&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 14-meal Spring Break package is priced at $87.50, which is equivalent to getting four meals for free. The package is available for purchase beginning March 12.</span></p>
<h3>Meal giveaway</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Student Life has partnered with Dining on a meal raffle, where students will automatically be entered into a drawing to earn one free meal if they&#8217;ve indicated that they plan to stay over the spring break. Winners will be able to pick up their meal at one of the dining locations open over the break: Crown/Merrill or Colleges Nine and Ten dining halls. In total, the university plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give away 10 meals a week until spring break begins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>&#8216;Staycation explorations&#8217; around Santa Cruz</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Student Life is also putting together </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Slug Staycations&#8221; for students while they have downtime. There will be directions for outdoor self-guided tours (forest, beach, and town), as well as indoor options if you are looking to relax (self-care, which you can do from your room). More information will be posted soon on the college Instagram accounts with the hashtag #slugstaycation.</span></p>
<h3>Scavenger hunts and Instagram challenges</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to use this opportunity to get to know the campus in a fun and creative way? The Division of Student Affairs and Success will be hosting on-campus scavenger hunts and Instagram challenges over spring break. Follow the Division of Student Affairs and Success Instagram </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc.dsas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@ucsc.dsas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more details. Scavenger hunts and challenges will begin on Friday, March 19.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to also check out the student-produced </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/slugcast/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugcast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your one-stop podcast for Slug life, news, interviews, and more. Find Slugcast on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Montano (Cowell '24, legal studies and politics) is helping to organize the scavenger hunts and is looking forward to the downtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given our situation (with COVID-19), I thought staying here would be the safest choice,&#8221; Montano said. &#8220;I would have had to travel out of state otherwise. Now I can take this opportunity to take some time for myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Enjoy the outdoors<strong>&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to be active outdoors? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz is an outdoor recreation gold mine. Athletics and Recreation&#8217;s Adventure Rec staff and student leaders are excited to add to the appeal of a Santa Cruz &#8216;staycation&#8217; with these local adventures that encourage fun and friendship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time kayakers and outdoor adventurers are more than welcome to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athletics and Recreation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be hosting a series of </span><a href="https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProducts?productTypeCV=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000003502&amp;classification=5234520d-c6ce-47a3-a8c9-f4d58ad04f74"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campus day hikes and Santa Cruz Harbor kayak tours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the campus&#8217;s spring break staycation events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProgramDetails?courseId=0d4997a1-9351-4d25-b79b-2bd691b09044&amp;semesterId=1128c426-82b9-4518-a734-d23229bd7b22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayak tours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monterey Bay will be held Monday&#8211;Thursday (March 22&#8211;25) for $40 per person per tour. Limited spots are available; students will need to register in advance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and must show a &#8220;Green Badge&#8221; for that specific date, confirming clearance to participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All kayaking gear will be provided.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProgramDetails?courseId=af5f8afc-301b-4b8a-9456-26b62ed9f30f&amp;semesterId=1128c426-82b9-4518-a734-d23229bd7b22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus day hikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take place at Wilder Ranch State Park, Pogonip, and Henry Cowell State Park. This is an opportunity to experience some of the &#8220;special spots&#8221; within the upper UCSC campus. Hikes are $13 and range from 5&#8211;10 miles long. Registration is required.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Nelson (College Nine '24, computer science), who arrived in-person during the winter quarter, hopes spring break will allow him to get more acclimated to the campus and community and enjoy some outdoor fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I decided to stay for personal reasons. I&#8217;ve only been on campus for 4 weeks, and I only have 13 weeks left in my very first year of college,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to getting to know the town a little bit more, meeting new people, and doing some COVID-safe surfing.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Keep up with your COVID testing</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, CHES wants to remind students who are staying on campus that they still need to take part in twice-weekly testing over the break at Merrill Cultural Center. Make sure to use the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health e-Messenger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> application to make an appointment, Monday&#8211;Thursday over spring break (the campus will be closed on Friday). Students who travel will need to sequester for 10 days upon their return.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="27e72ec9807270172c1b96bdfb754485"><name>native-american-cultural-affiliation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Second systemwide review of revised policy on UC Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation.</summary><start-date>1615276800000</start-date><display-name>UC Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation</display-name><path>/2021/03/native-american-cultural-affiliation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/native-american-cultural-affiliation</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1615577165484</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1615914645781</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation. The proposed Policy substantively revises the existing Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Interim Policy (&#8220;Current Policy&#8221;). The Policy pertains to the treatment and repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains and cultural items under the University&#8217;s possession or control and the University&#8217;s compliance with the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (&#8220;NAGPRA&#8221;), its accompanying regulations, and the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (&#8220;CalNAGPRA&#8221;).&#160; Revision efforts began in 2018 in response to AB 2836, a California bill that required the University to revise its previous Policy. During the consultation process AB 275 which made substantial changes to the CalNAGPRA was signed into law, effective January 1, 2021. This revised Policy now incorporates AB 275 requirements. The complete revision history is available at <a href="http://ucal.us/nagpra">http://ucal.us/nagpra</a>.</p>
<p>The revised policy is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/nagpra21.pdf">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the significant changes present in the proposed Policy from the Interim Policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definitions (&#167; II) have been added and revised where needed to align with CalNAGPRA.</li>
<li>As required by CalNAGPRA, deference to tribal traditional knowledge, oral histories, documentation, and testimonies is now indicated when determining state cultural affiliation, identifying cultural items under CalNAGPRA, and making decisions related to the CalNAGPRA repatriation process (&#167;&#167; V.C.1 and V.J.1).</li>
<li>In consultation with California Native American tribes, Campuses must prepare preliminary inventories/summaries by January 1, 2022 for submission to the NAHC (&#167;&#167; V.B.1.k, V.C.1, and V.C.5).</li>
<li>The CalNAGPRA dispute procedures available to California Indian tribes have been added (&#167; V.I).</li>
<li>The AB 275 procedures for submissions of claims under CalNAGPRA have been incorporated (&#167; V.D.3).</li>
<li>The flowcharts and narrative previously described in Appendices A, A-1, and B of the Interim Policy have been removed. These documents were intended as visual aids in understanding the consultation, claims, repatriation, and appeals processes described in the Interim Policy rather than as a means of separately conveying policy requirements not described in the Interim Policy. However, as stated in the revised Policy (&#167;&#167; III.C, V.B.1.i, V.B.2, V.D.1, V.D.3, V.I, V.J.3, and VI.1), UC will maintain these flowcharts on UCOP&#8217;s NAGPRA website. This will allow UC to make more responsive ongoing updates to the flowcharts to clarify these processes as they are more fully implemented, based on feedback from tribes, committee members, and UC repatriation staff.</li>

For the near term, these changes will not result in significant operational changes. However, as the pandemic environment is dynamic, we anticipate that there will be changes that will influence our planning for fall 2021. More information on these changes will be provided beginning next week.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our campus </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615679494297000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRudlj63gC2_ItNiDU1RaV-peEag" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>COVID-19 case rates</span></a><span> remain at a low level, with a 0.09% positivity rate, and as of today, we have vaccinated nearly 2,600 people with one or both doses.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In additional positive news, this week, Santa Cruz County moved into the red tier of the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615679494297000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmSAq-ukoyitMGJ-Wf4ZTyMgTa3w" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Blueprint for a Safer Economy</span></a><span>, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released guidance for individuals who are fully vaccinated. As a result, you might have questions about how this impacts campus operations and your need to follow certain safety guidelines when on campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>How California color tiers impact what is and what is not allowed</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are a multitude of federal, state, University of California, and local guidelines and requirements that impact our operations. One of the key guiding documents, and a good resource to refer to is the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-higher-education--en.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615679494297000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2Sfbw-f8-Appe4pAN8j1RzotEmQ" href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-higher-education--en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>industry guidance for higher education institutions</span></a><span>. Some of the guidelines and requirements are mapped to the color tiers, while others remain effective regardless of the color tier. In addition, as our campus also contains a variety of operations, </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615679494297000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFTFGTNp3rEjpHHByRHwjqB8fotg" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>other industry guidance</span></a><span>, such as that for dining, child care, and construction also applies to us.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As part of the state vaccination efforts, the data points used to determine when a county can move forward through the tiers will be loosened. Forty percent of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the state have occurred in communities that are in the lowest quartile of the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthyplacesindex.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615679494297000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFClk7nKL8nZelPxqLdRxOMe9gdnA" href="https://healthyplacesindex.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Healthy Places Index</span></a><span>. To address this inequity, the state will now be directing 40 percent of vaccine doses to those communities. Once 2 million vaccines have been given in those locations, the thresholds for moving forward in the state color tiers will change, and once 4 million vaccines have been given in those communities, the tiers will change again.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is from noon to 3:10 p.m. and is sponsored by the </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/about/ccrt1/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinated Community Review Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will be held virtually and is open to all students, staff, and faculty. The address for registration is </span><a href="http://bit.ly/3vaqItA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://bit.ly/3vaqItA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A website with more information and a complete schedule is </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/about/ccrt1/svsh-folder/svsh-research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symposium will also be the first campus event for Sexual Assault Awareness Month, an annual campaign to raise public awareness about sexual assault and to educate on how to prevent sexual violence on campus. This April marks the 20th anniversary of the first Sexual Assault Awareness Month, or SAAM, nationwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine research presentations are scheduled in three panels. Subject areas include affirmative consent, prevention of sexual assault in fieldwork settings, romanticized stalking, and gendered experiences and sexual harassment of STEM graduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symposium is the inspiration of Sona Kaur, a Ph.D. candidate in social psychology, who has served as a graduate intern with the campus Title IX office since September 2019. She first proposed the symposium more than a year ago but it ran into significant logistic delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaur said the goal is to link research in the fields of sexual violence and sexual harassment with the practice of education and prevention.&#160; &#8220;We want to bring researchers and those who actually apply this work into conversation with each other and see how we can really engage in each other&#8217;s work,&#8221; Kaur said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to share the research happening on campus especially with the </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://care.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE) offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Kaur said. &#8220;We often provide training and workshops on issues such as consent not knowing that others are also engaged in this work but use a different approach. More can be done to foster collaboration between these offices and researchers because we all are invested in these issues &#8212; violence and harassment &#8212;&#160; with the same goal of prevention.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The onset of the pandemic prevented the symposium a year ago, Kaur said. &#8220;This year we thought we would try to make it happen as we are all more familiar with the online remote </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">world.&#8221;&#160; Beyond organizing the research symposium, Kaur will also deliver a presentation based on her research: &#8220;Perceptions of Romanticized Stalking&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual violence and sexual harassment is pervasive in and impacts college-aged, LGBTQ, and female-identified students at significantly higher rates, researchers have found.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts in the field say students impacted by sexual violence and sexual harassment are more likely to experience adverse outcomes, such as those related to mental and physical health. Higher levels of anxiety and depression are common among survivors. Sexual violence and sexual harassment also disrupts students&#8217; academic progress, resulting in absenteeism and lower GPAs and retention rates, they say.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coordinated Community Review Team is a broad group that&#160; advises campus leadership and the greater community about best practices in policies, education, prevention, and response to these kinds of incidents. Its membership includes Title IX, the Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE) office, Ethnic Resource Centers, graduate and undergraduate student representatives, and off-campus affiliates such as the Walnut Avenue Family &amp; Women&#8217;s Center and Monarch Services.</span></p>

Consider joining the Staff Advisory Board!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the UCSC Staff Advisory Board (SAB) is to support the welfare and diversity of the UCSC staff. The Board does this by serving in an advisory capacity to our campus leadership and other campus parties or organizations. Our advocacy promotes better communication and relations among the staff and our larger campus community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some tangible examples of this advocacy are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating the Chancellor&#8217;s Forum events twice per year and engaging in a year-round conversation with the Chancellor&#8217;s office.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the </span><a href="https://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving on campuswide committees, such as the Employee Housing Work Group.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting the Staff Appreciation Picnic, once we&#8217;re all meeting in person again.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nominations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now until March 31st, the SAB is accepting nominations for four open spots on the Board. We will verify that each nominee meets the eligibility criteria, according to </span><a href="https://sab.ucsc.edu/about/by-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SAB bylaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To be eligible for Board membership, nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be policy governed (non-represented)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either be past probation in a Career/Partial-Year Career appointment or be in a Contract appointment with at least six months served in that contract.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customary term of office for each member is three years. The term begins on July 1, 2021 and ends on June 30, 2024. Contracted staff employees or other employees, for whom serving a three-year term is not possible, may serve a shorter term. Their availability will be mentioned in their candidate summary during elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there is a time commitment to serving on the SAB, it is strongly recommended that nominees have the support of their supervisor.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please </span><a href="https://forms.gle/jJmpjqcaHp4cnkE57"><strong>fill out this form</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to submit your nomination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections for the three-year term will be held from April 5th-16th. As part of the election process, the name, position, years of service and nomination statement for each eligible nominee will be posted on the ballot for staff to review and vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for considering serving on the Staff Advisory Board.

<p>Dear campus community,</p>
<p>One year ago this week, we announced that all classes and final exams would be remote for the rest of the winter quarter. We did not know then that we would spend the rest of the year primarily remote and that we would find ourselves where we are now &#8212; marking such a somber anniversary one year later. We can count the days we have been apart, but not what we have lost.</p>
<p>Each of us has been touched by the pandemic in some way &#8212; through the loss of some of our community members, our loved ones and our friends; through the isolation wrought by the new ways we have been forced to live to promote safety; and through the sacrifice of so many opportunities that seemed all but guaranteed previously. We are also still grappling with the pandemic of racism and inequity that COVID-19 has thrown into acute relief. These problems are not behind us, but I am encouraged that we face them together as an engaged, creative and compassionate community.</p>
<p>There are no silver linings bright enough or lessons learned that can possibly make up for the past year. The cost has been unbearably high. But amid the loss and pain, I also feel a deep well of gratitude for those essential workers in areas such as agriculture, health care, and food service, who have helped to shepherd us through this difficult time. I am deeply grateful as well for our community and for how we have stayed connected despite all that would pull us apart. I would like to mark this anniversary with that gratitude and with hope for a future that looks very different from our past</p>
<p>Many criticize higher education for being old-fashioned and incapable of change. Our campus disproves that. UC Santa Cruz began as an experiment in higher education and we have continuously embraced that notion, adapting to the changing world and striving to improve it. In that way, this year is not an exception, but one more example of what makes us special. It has not been easy by any means. It took every person in our community working toward the common goal of continuing our world-changing work while prioritizing well-being. I know that we still have many challenges to face, but with each week I am becoming even more optimistic about the future. More than anything, I am grateful for each of you.</p>
<p>Remember no matter where you are, you&#8217;re still a Banana Slug.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy</p>

<p>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on proposed changes to the Universitywide Police Policies and Administrative Procedures, which are applicable to UC Peace Officers.</p>
<p>The revisions to the Gold Book include:</p>
<p><em>Use of Force</em> (presently Chapter 8) Propose changes to the Use of Force policy reflect legislative changes to the use of deadly force (Assembly Bill 392), the language required in a use of force policy (Senate Bill 230), additions/clarifications to definitions, and revisions to emphasize de-escalation.</p>
<p><em>Body Worn Video</em> (new) Provides a systemwide approach to the use of the body-worn cameras purchased and distributed to the campuses in 2019/2020.</p>
<p><em>Systemwide Response Teams</em> (new) Drafted to create specialized response teams to respond to crowd management situations.</p>
<p><em>Concealed Carry Weapons</em> (new) Drafted on the recommendation of the Systemwide Council of Chiefs of Police to adopt a systemwide and consistent policy on the issuance of concealed carry weapons to qualified retired police officers (as required by statute); the policy also specifies that medically retired police officers are not entitled to CCW (pursuant to recent case law).</p>
<p>The proposed policy text is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/gold-book-drafts-spring-21.pdf">available online.</a></p>
<p>Those who wish to provide comments on the proposed changes may submit them to the Policy Coordination Office at <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu">pco@ucsc.edu</a> by close of business Friday, May 7, 2021.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services; and Jean Marie Scott, Associate Vice Chancellor, Risk and Safety Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="384b554a807270172c1b96bd8ac5b325"><name>uc-policy-review-gifts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Systemwide review of revised policy on the classification of gifts and sponsored awards</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Classification of Gifts and Sponsored Awards.  &#13;

<p>The University has seen a significant increase in external support in the recent decade &#8211; especially from private foundations (including family foundations) and corporations. Though key concepts remain the same, the proposed policy provides greater clarity for properly classifying private support in contemporary circumstances. It also includes definitions, FAQs, and a checklist with weighted criteria.</p>

This successful outcome is the result of UC&#8217;s faculty, librarians and university leadership coming together to stand firm on our <a>goals</a> of making UC research freely available to all and transforming scholarly communication for the better.</p>
<p>The new four-year agreement will go into effect on April 1, 2021, restoring UC&#8217;s direct online access to Elsevier journals while accomplishing the university&#8217;s<a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf"> two goals</a> for all publisher agreements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enabling universal open access to all UC research; and</li>
<li>Containing the excessively high costs associated with licensing journals.</li>
</ol>
<p>These goals directly support UC&#8217;s responsibility as a steward of public funds and its mission as a public university to make its research freely available. The agreement with Elsevier will double the number of articles covered by UC&#8217;s open access agreements.</p>
<p>What the agreement means for the UC community</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading access:</strong> By April 1, 2021, UC will have regained access to all articles published in Elsevier journals the libraries subscribed to before, plus additional journals to which UC previously did not subscribe. Access to those journals in ScienceDirect will start to be restored now and will continue to be added until they are all available on April 1. If you cannot access a particular journal yet, you can <a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/ill/alternativeaccess">access articles in other ways</a> in the interim.</li>
<li><strong>Open access publishing in Elsevier journals:</strong> The agreement also provides for open access publishing of UC research in nearly 2,300 Elsevier journals from day one. The Cell Press and Lancet families of journals will be integrated midway through the four-year agreement; UC&#8217;s agreement is the first in the world to provide for open access publishing in the entire suite of these prestigious journals.</li>
<li><strong>Library support for open access publishing:</strong> All articles with a UC corresponding author will be open access by default, with the library automatically paying the first $1,000 of the open access fee (also known as an article publishing charge or APC). Authors will be asked to pay the remainder of the APC if they have research funds available to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Discounts on publishing:</strong> To lower those costs even further for authors, UC has negotiated a 15 percent discount on the APCs for most <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/search-results?labels=journals">Elsevier journals</a>; the discount is 10 percent for the Cell Press and Lancet families of journals.</li>
<li><strong>Full funding support for those who need it:</strong> To ensure that all authors have the opportunity to publish their work open access, the library will cover the full amount of the APC for those who do not have sufficient research funds for the author share. Authors may also opt out of open access publishing if they wish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The economics of the deal</h3>
<p>As with UC&#8217;s other recent open access agreements, the Elsevier agreement integrates library and author payments into a single, cost-controlled contract. This shared funding model enables the campus libraries to reallocate a portion of our journals budget to help subsidize authors&#8217; APCs &#8212; assistance that makes it easier and more affordable for authors to choose to publish open access.</p>
<p>Even with library support, authors&#8217; research funds continue to play a critical role. This funding model only works if authors who do have funds pay their share of the APC.</p>
<p>In the other open access agreements UC has implemented, we are already seeing a significant proportion of authors paying their share of the APC. If this promising trend continues, UC can blaze a path to full open access that is sustainable across ever more publishers.</p>
<h3>Partnering with publishers of all types and sizes</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the university continues to forge partnerships with publishers of all types and sizes. In addition to Elsevier, UC also signed open access agreements with three more not-for-profit and society publishers this month &#8212; <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2021/03/new-oa-agreement-uc-and-the-company-of-biologists">The Company of Biologists</a>, <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2021/03/new-oa-agreement-uc-and-the-royal-society">The Royal Society</a> and <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2021/03/new-oa-agreement-uc-and-canadian-science-publishing">Canadian Science Publishing</a>. These agreements are in addition to those secured previously with <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/springer-nature-transformative-oa-agreement/">Springer Nature</a>, <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/cambridge-transformative-oa-agreement/">Cambridge University Press</a>, society publisher <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/acm-transformative-oa-agreement/">ACM</a>, and native open access publishers <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/plos-oa-agreement/">PLOS</a> and <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/jmir-oa-agreement/">JMIR</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, UC&#8217;s goal is to make it possible for all authors to publish their work open access in whatever journal they choose &#8212; providing broad public access to the fruits of UC&#8217;s research. This month, we have made a tremendous stride in that direction. We know that this has been a lengthy process and we thank you for your patience and support as we worked to reach this outcome.</p>

<p>The program provides support to excellent postdoctoral scholars who applied and ranked very highly but were not selected by the University of California President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.</p>
<p>The systemwide program was established in 1984 to encourage outstanding women and minority Ph.D. recipients to pursue academic careers at the University of California. The current program offers postdoctoral research fellowships, professional development and faculty mentoring to outstanding scholars in all fields whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity at UC.</p>
<p>Nearly 75 percent of UC President's Postdoctoral Fellows have received tenure track faculty appointments. Since 2003, more than 100 former fellows have received faculty appointments at University of California campuses.</p>
<p>Starting this fall, UCSC will fund two types of Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program awards: one that is fully funded, and one that is awarded without salary for those who have secured an alternative source of postdoctoral funding. Awards may be for up to two years in residence at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program helps UC Santa Cruz support emerging scholars--especially those who are underrepresented in the faculty ranks--who are poised to have long and successful careers in academia, and whose work contributes to diversity, equity, and inclusion on UC campuses and across the country,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.</p>
<p>In addition to fully funding up to two Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowships, UC Santa Cruz also sponsors awards for highly-ranked PPFP finalists who obtain funding from other sources. These additional Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowships (CPF) provide $5,000 in research/travel funds. All Fellows, regardless of whether they are appointed with or without salary, participate in the President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (PPFP) professional development activities.</p>
<p>Candidates for the UC Santa Cruz CPF must follow the same application procedures as candidates for the <a href="https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/index.html">University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship program</a>. </p>
<p>For additional questions about UC Santa Cruz Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowships, please email the Associate Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning at avpaa@ucsc.edu. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="423927d0807270172c1b96bd58800903"><name>statement-against-anti-asian-racism</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement against Anti-Asian racism and violence </title><summary>This tragedy highlights an escalating pattern of anti-Asian hate crimes that we have seen in our region and country over the past year.</summary><start-date>1615964400000</start-date><display-name>Statement against Anti-Asian racism and violence </display-name><path>/2021/03/statement-against-anti-asian-racism</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/statement-against-anti-asian-racism</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1616018745252</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616018745252</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear campus community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We write today to share our grief for the loss of the eight people murdered Tuesday in Atlanta. While we do not yet know all of the details, some reports indicate that people were targeted for violence based on their perceived race and gender. Six of those killed were of Asian descent and seven were women. The loss of life is compounded by what underlies it &#8212; hate, anti-Asian discrimination, misogyny, and white supremacy. We must condemn this violence and the hate that motivates it unequivocally and with one voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tragedy highlights an escalating pattern of anti-Asian hate crimes that we have seen in our region and country over the past year. Anti-Asian hate crimes have increased by 149 percent in 2020, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.csusb.edu/sites/default/files/FACT%20SHEET-%20Anti-Asian%20Hate%202020%203.2.21.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey of police departments in 16 major U.S. cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Throughout the pandemic we have also seen </span><a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/in-focus-gender-equality-in-covid-19-response/violence-against-women-during-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an increase in violence against women worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing a global pandemic together has shown us how inextricably connected our community is at every level. Many, however, have used the pandemic as one more vehicle for fomenting racist, sexist, anti-Asian sentiment and as a cover for enacting violence against people based on their racial and ethnic backgrounds. There is never justification for such violence and there is no truth to any account that blames a particular group or country for COVID-19 or any of its variants. We urge you to speak up and voice the truth if you hear these racist claims.&#160;</span></p>

UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Michael Loik was a coauthor on the paper, and his contributions honed in on the impacts for plant communities in coastal California and in deserts across California and Arizona.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Loik&#8217;s work focuses on how freezing affects plants on a cellular level. Under normal conditions, winter freezes are a major environmental stressor that limits where some plants and animals can survive and reproduce. This helps to define the natural geographic range of each species. But because of climate change, winters in many regions are getting warmer, on average, with fewer days of freezing temperatures. This can lead to major ecological changes.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What this might do is allow plants and animals to expand their habitat and their range or distribution because they no longer have that freezing limit,&#8221; Loik said. &#8220;In some cases, those species might be problematic as invasive species. In other cases, it might be native species in California or Arizona, or along the U.S. border, that move northwards or to higher elevations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper examined these effects for plants and animals across California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In that process, the authors also analyzed changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold snaps in San Francisco, Tucson, New Orleans, and Tampa using temperature records stretching back to the 1940s.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decline in the number of days with freezing temperatures was most apparent for San Francisco. Prior to 1980, most winters in San Francisco had several days each year with freezing temperatures, and some years even had about two weeks worth of subfreezing days. But since the &#8216;80s, there have been only 14 days with subzero temperatures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced freezes will likely mean increased potential for the spread of nonnative invasive grasses that fuel wildfires across California and other western states. Invasive tropical plants also compete with native temperate species for resources and habitat. But some cold-sensitive native plants may expand their ranges too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, coastal species rely on the moderating effects of the Pacific Ocean, which keeps temperatures cooler in the summertime and warmer in the winter. As winter temperatures warm across the state, these plants may be able to venture farther inland without risking a freeze.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coastal barrel cactus is one example from the paper of a rare plant that could potentially increase its range in California under warmer conditions. The saguaro cactus may do the same in Arizona.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Loik cautions that the ability of any species to successfully migrate in response to climate change is complex, and success is far from guaranteed. Physical barriers like topography or urban development can prevent migration, and in many parts of the West, drought may also play a limiting role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are these surprises that come up, where species are compelled to move, but other factors or processes get in the way or complicate things and preclude them from being able to do that,&#8221; Loik said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study&#8217;s authors suggest that modeling efforts could further explore how lengthening intervals between cold snaps might affect plant and animal communities. Laboratory studies could also help researchers learn how tropical species adapt to extreme conditions, and a scientific &#8220;rapid response&#8221; network could study future cold snaps as they happen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, while freezes are becoming less frequent, they won&#8217;t go away altogether. Loik says it&#8217;s important to remember that people, plants, and animals will still experience cold winter weather, even as our climate changes. And researchers still have much to learn about how extreme cold events help to shape our ecosystems.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

study&#8212;in collaboration with UC Water and the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at UC Merced&#8212;that suggests covering California&#8217;s 6,350 km network of public water delivery canals with solar panels could be an economically feasible means of advancing both renewable energy and water conservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of &#8220;solar canals&#8221; has been gaining momentum around the world as climate change increases the risk of drought in many regions. Solar panels can shade canals to help prevent water loss through evaporation, and some types of solar panels also work better over canals, because the cooler environment keeps them from overheating.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot projects in India have demonstrated the technical feasibility of several designs, but none have yet been deployed at scale. California&#8217;s canal network is the world&#8217;s largest water conveyance system, and the state faces both a drought-prone future and a rapid timeline for transitioning to renewable energy. Solar canals could target both challenges, but making the case for their implementation in California requires first quantifying the potential benefits. So that&#8217;s exactly what researchers set out to do in their paper published by </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00693-8.epdf?sharing_token=didQC1xUqt1qyGVnt3Z12dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mb3g4mLTCIVkzQOaSaqfLUi1Bq6MCdtZK6XJUm5MJAMPv8iXZ-uGljoJVz2bpMqUAvDY2ySHIn9UMZbdBvvphuM4bCei4t3oXznuu_ozlQ8e3S_s2Ozy2Khvnhy81rHCk%3D"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Sustainability</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While it makes sense to cover canals with solar panels because renewable energy and water conservation is a win-win, the devil is in the details,&#8221; said Brandi McKuin, lead author of the new study and a UC Santa Cruz postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies. &#8220;A critical question was whether the infrastructure to span the canals would be cost-prohibitive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canal-spanning solar panels are often supported either by steel trusses or suspension cables, both of which are more expensive to build than traditional support structures for ground-mounted solar panels. But McKuin led a techno-economic analysis that showed how the benefits of solar canals combine to outweigh the added costs for cable-supported installations. In fact, cable-supported solar canals showed a 20-50 percent higher net present value, indicating greater financial return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to benefits like increased solar panel performance and evaporation savings, shade from solar panels could help control the growth of aquatic weeds, which are a costly canal maintenance issue. Placing solar panels over existing canal sites could also avoid costs associated with land use. Now that the new paper has provided a more concrete assessment of these benefits, members of the research team hope this could lead to future field experiments with solar canals in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This study is a very important step toward encouraging investments to produce renewable energy while also saving water,&#8221; said Roger Bales, a coauthor on the paper who is a distinguished professor of engineering at UC Merced, the former director of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, and a director at UC Water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bales was part of the original group that got the project started in 2016, when San Francisco-based social impact agency Citizen Group approached UC Solar and UC Water with the concept. From there, the research grew into a collaboration between UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz, and Citizen Group, with funding support from NRG Energy and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Brandi McKuin started working on the project while completing her Ph.D. at Merced, then continued with help from senior author and UCSC professor Elliott Campbell, the Stephen R. Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food Systems and a fellow Merced transplant. UC Merced professor Joshua Viers and researcher Tapan Pathak advised on the project, and graduate students Andrew Zumkehr and Jenny Ta contributed to analysis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zumkehr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led a complex hydrological analysis using data from satellites, climate models, and automated weather stations to model and compare evaporation rates at canal sites across the state, with and without shade from solar panels. McKuin then used this information in her assessment to calculate the financial benefits of reduced evaporation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it was the cost savings of many combined benefits that made solar canals financially viable, rather than benefits from reduced evaporation alone. But the study also notes that benefits from deploying solar canals could extend beyond immediate financial impacts. For example, every megawatt of solar energy produced by solar canals in California&#8217;s Central Valley has the potential to replace 15-20 diesel-powered irrigation pumps, helping to reduce pollution in a region with some of the nation&#8217;s worst air quality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And senior author Elliott Campbell says the wide range of benefits identified by the paper is, in itself, an important lesson to carry forward. He sees the findings as not only an assessment of solar canals, but also a clear illustration of the interconnections between urgent global issues like air quality, energy, and water conservation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing here is actually some surprising benefits when you bring water and energy together,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;Sometimes it leads to a smoother landing in how we transition to better ways of making energy and saving water.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="472b4151807270172c1b96bd5fee1cd4"><name>student-housing-west-approved</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Regents approve UC Santa Cruz plan to increase student housing, expand child care</title><summary>Recognizing the critical role housing plays in supporting student success, the University of California Board of Regents reapproved a project that will significantly increase the number of current UC Santa Cruz students who are able to live on campus.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West will enable UC Santa Cruz to offer much more housing to its graduate students and upper-division undergraduates by building new housing units with space for more than 3,000 students. The project, spread across two sites, will also allow the campus to expand child-care services.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Cynthia Larive said Student Housing West provides the most rapid and direct route to creating more housing for undergraduate students and graduate students. Housing equity is a foundation for student success, one of the campus&#8217;s highest priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students should be focused on their studies&#8212;not whether they&#8217;ll be able to find an affordable place to live,&#8221; said Larive. &#8220;This project will offer our current students many more options for living on campus and allow them to avoid competing in the local housing market, which is only growing more expensive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larive on Wednesday presented the project to the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee. Regents voiced their support for more campus housing in Santa Cruz and made clear that the campus must prioritize affordability.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In evaluating Student Housing West and alternatives, campus leaders factored in many objectives with affordability and minimal displacement of students with families being among them. The project UC Santa Cruz brought to the board both makes most programmatic sense&#8212;as it creates a new student family community and child care facility near existing employee housing&#8212;and it&#8217;s the project that will allow the campus to create the most affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Regent-designate Art Torres (Stevenson, &#8217;68, government) said he supported the chancellor&#8217;s position and praised her careful evaluation of the project and willingness to hear all the differing perspectives on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres said there&#8217;s no better place for students with children to live than the UCSC campus and supported the campus in trying to create a supportive environment for student families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a graduate and someone who has followed this very closely over the years, this is a much overdue and very needed project,&#8221; Torres said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently limited on-campus housing options for upper-division undergraduates and graduate students. Many of these students must find housing in the surrounding community, which remains in a severe housing crisis, like much of the state.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The housing shortage in Santa Cruz has only grown more urgent, both because of the summer wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and the increasing number of people deciding to move to Santa Cruz because they can work remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is renowned for its transformative undergraduate educational experience that&#8217;s rooted in its 10 residential colleges. Before COVID-19 required a switch to primarily remote activities, UC Santa Cruz was housing about 9,300 students, more than half of its undergraduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West will offer a variety of housing accommodations and allow upper-division undergraduate students and graduate students to continue living on campus, instead of seeking housing in the local community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge roads will be used to build a new housing community for students with families and a new early childhood education center that will serve the children of faculty and staff as well as students. The site is across the street from existing employee housing, near Westlake Elementary School, and near the campus&#8217;s main entrance. The campus is hoping to start construction as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the new housing community is built, UC Santa Cruz will be able to tear down the aging buildings currently home to students with families so that the campus can build six new buildings that will provide housing for approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and 220 graduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West will also advance the campus&#8217;s long-standing commitment to sustainability. The project includes solar panels as well as a water recycling facility that will allow UC Santa Cruz to reuse wastewater for non-potable uses, such as flushing toilets and irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West was first approved two years ago, though lawsuits prevented the campus from meeting its original timeline to build more housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Santa Cruz County judge in October 2020 upheld UC&#8217;s detailed environmental review of Student Housing West. The project underwent a thorough analysis, underscoring the campus&#8217;s commitment to the environment. The judge also concluded errors were made in the process the Regents used when they first approved the project.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p><span>The <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org"><strong><i>SlaveVoyages database</i></strong></a>, previously hosted at Emory University, will now function as a cooperative academic collaboration through a contractual agreement among six institutions: Emory University, the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Omohundro Institute of Early American History &amp; Culture at William &amp; Mary, Rice University, and three campuses of the University of California that will assume a joint membership&#8212;UC Santa Cruz, UC Irvine and UC Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span>Slavevoyages.org had its origins in the 1960s, when historians began collecting data on slave ship voyages and estimating the number of enslaved Africans to cross the Atlantic from the 16th through 19th centuries. Over the years, the data was transferred from punch cards, to laptop computer, to a CD-ROM published in 1999, until it ultimately landed on a website at Emory University in 2008.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Twenty years and four million viewers after its first appearance as a CD-ROM, the future of 48,000 slaving ventures recorded in&#160;SlaveVoyages is finally secured for posterity," noted Henry Louis Gates Jr., Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and director of Harvard&#8217;s Hutchins Center, a consortium member.</span></p>
<p><span>Gates has described SlaveVoyages.org as &#8220;a gold mine&#8221; and &#8220;one of the most dramatically significant research projects in the history of African studies, African American studies, and the history of world slavery itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>SlaveVoyages.org is the culmination</strong> of both independent and collaborative work by a multidisciplinary team of international scholars and historians&#8212;including UC Santa Cruz history professor Greg O&#8217;Malley.</span></p>
<p><span>He helped create the Intra-American Slave Trade Database, which was added to <a href="http://www.slavevoyages.org/">www.slavevoyages.org</a> as a companion to the much older Transatlantic Slave Trade Database in 2019. It documents more than 11,500 trading voyages that moved enslaved people from one port in the Americas to another.</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley compiled the foundational data set of about 7,600 voyages for the Intra-American Database in research for his first book&#160;<a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469629841/final-passages/">Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</a>, and then partnered with UC Irvine professor Alex Borucki and other scholars to expand the coverage to all of the Americas and take the project online.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;One powerful thing that the Intra-American Slave Trade Database reveals is just how ubiquitous slavery was in the Americas,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley noted. &#8220;We don&#8217;t just document voyages to the obvious places we all think of associated with slavery, such as Virginia, South Carolina, or Jamaica. The Intra-American database shows voyages delivering enslaved people as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as Argentina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;All of the original 13 colonies that would become the United States appear in the database receiving shipments of enslaved people. And ships registered in every colony traded slaves elsewhere as well. So slavery was not just a southern problem or atrocity. It was an American one, and I mean &#8216;America&#8217; as both the entire U.S. and the entire hemisphere. Slavery was virtually everywhere in the Americas, in varying degrees, and white colonists across all the colonies profited from slave trading.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley serves on the Operational Committee for the whole website, which reviews data submitted by researchers for inclusion, responds to the many inquiries from the media and the website&#8217;s users, and plans future developments. In that capacity, he was involved in the outreach to other institutions about consortium membership, meeting with staff at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Omohundro Institute for Early American History and Culture as part of recruiting them to join.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The slave trade database project has been crucial for understanding the overwhelming scale of the slave trade, the routes of the African diaspora, the human cost of such trafficking in terms of lives lost, and the profits of this trade at other people&#8217;s expense,&#8217; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;It has helped develop a scholarly consensus on the approximate number of people forced across the Atlantic, with more than 12.5 million people departing Africa and more than 10.7 million arriving in the Americas&#8212;and nearly 2 million more dying in between. And it&#8217;s become a resource for people tracing the spread of African cultures in the Americas, people assessing who profited from this murderous business, and for individuals studying their own family histories and seeking their cultural roots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>With the creation of the new consortium</strong>, O&#8217;Malley noted that <i>SlaveVoyages </i>will continue to serve as a model, inspiring other research and serving as a resource for new initiatives and broader public understanding of the history of slavery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>He reflected on what impact this robust resource might add to the current national conversation about race.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The appalling evidence of mortality in the slave trade also resonates with the modern Black Lives Matter movement,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;The devaluing of black life in American society has a long history predating the modern examples of systemic violence against Black people and the repeated failures of our society to hold the perpetrators of such violence accountable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The slave trade required a callous disregard for Black life in order to function. Slave traders purchased black people in one port to ship them over vast distances for profitable resale. To facilitate security and keep costs down, such traders confined enslaved people in horrifically crowded conditions aboard ships. Those who died, the traders simply threw overboard. Traders tried to keep captives alive in order to profit from their sale, but they could tolerate substantial mortality because enslaved people brought high prices throughout the Americas and because&#8212;at some fundamental level&#8212;the lives of Black people did not matter to the traders beyond the profits that could be made by selling them or exploiting their labor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We have to say &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; in the present because we are fighting against the weight of that history. Too often, then and now, Black lives were and are treated as expendable,&#8221; he added.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cc7818e807270172c1b96bd0db1d889"><name>sinervo-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Influential evolutionary biologist Barry Sinervo dies at age 60</title><summary>Sinervo made landmark contributions ranging from evolutionary biology and game theory to the effects of climate change on animals and ecosystems.</summary><start-date>1616396400000</start-date><display-name>Influential evolutionary biologist Barry Sinervo dies at age 60</display-name><path>/2021/03/sinervo-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/sinervo-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1616195846510</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616428163079</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/barry-sinervo-2010-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/barry-sinervo-2010-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barry-sinervo-2010-400.jpg</name><display-name>barry-sinervo-2010-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>84477</file-size><width>400</width><height>358</height></image><image-alt>Barry Sinervo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/barry-sinervo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/barry-sinervo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barry-sinervo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>barry-sinervo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20240</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Barry Sinervo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Barry Sinervo in 2010 with a pregnant mesquite lizard, one of the species he studied and found that local populations in Mexico had gone extinct due to rising temperatures.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Sinervo made landmark contributions ranging from evolutionary biology and game theory to the effects of climate change on animals and ecosystems</article-subhead><article-text><p>Barry Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz known for groundbreaking research in evolutionary biology and on the impacts of climate change, died on Monday, March 15, in Santa Cruz. Sinervo had been battling cancer for six years, but remained active in teaching and research. He was 60.</p>
<p>&#8220;The premature loss of Barry Sinervo&#8217;s blazingly creative thinking is a blow for the campus and for evolutionary biology and conservation science,&#8221; said Paul Koch, dean of UCSC&#8217;s Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>Sinervo&#8217;s research in evolutionary biology spanned population genetics, game theory, behavior, and physiology. His decades-long research on social systems and mating behavior in lizards led to a series of influential publications on the evolutionary dynamics and behavioral ecology of their mating strategies.</p>
<p>Sinervo also led an international team of biologists in a survey of lizard populations worldwide that found an alarming pattern of population extinctions connected to climate change. Those findings, published in <em>Science</em> in 2010, led Sinervo to focus increasingly on the issue of climate change. He led collaborative research projects with a global network of scientists studying the impacts of climate change worldwide and worked to inform the public about the urgency of the growing climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>In 2014, Sinervo helped establish the UC-wide <a href="https://iseeci.ucnrs.org/">Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts (ISEECI)</a> and served as its director, leveraging UC&#8217;s Natural Reserve System to study how climate change will affect California ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;He really connected UCSC globally with researchers studying the impacts of climate change around the world, and he was an important mentor for many scientists in developing countries,&#8221; said Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. &#8220;There&#8217;s been an outpouring of sympathy from around the world, and also celebration of his life and achievements. It&#8217;s clear that Barry had a big impact on a lot of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinervo was born in Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada. He earned his B.Sc. in biology and mathematics at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia and his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was an assistant professor of biology at Indiana University before joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1997.</p>
<p>For over three decades, Sinervo studied mating behavior in California&#8217;s side-blotched lizards. His research showed, among other things, that three different throat colors in male lizards correspond with different behaviors and mating strategies. The competition between these strategies (aggression, cooperation, and deception) takes the form of a rock-paper-scissors game in which no single type can dominate the population, and the abundance of each rises and falls in cycles.</p>
<p>Sinervo and his collaborators later discovered the same dynamic in an unrelated lizard species in Europe. More recently, he investigated how this type of mating system can be generalized and applied to other species, including mammals.</p>
<p>Sinervo&#8217;s research on the rock-paper-scissors game, starting with a landmark paper published in <em>Nature</em> in 1996, was influential in many areas beyond evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even economists reference Barry&#8217;s lizards in their books on game theory,&#8221; said Daniel Friedman, professor emeritus of economics at UCSC. &#8220;Rock-paper-scissors is an iconic game for game theorists, and Barry was the first to show an animal species plays this interesting game in its social system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friedman and Sinervo collaborated on several papers, taught courses together on evolutionary game theory, and coauthored a book, <em>Evolutionary Games in Natural, Social, and Virtual Worlds</em> (2016, Oxford University Press).</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a fun guy, alive with a new idea every minute. They didn&#8217;t all work, but they were always fun to explore, and many were really good ideas that no one else would have thought of,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;He was fearless and had his own way of looking at things. He reminded me of some of the early faculty, the type of people who made UCSC what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinervo&#8217;s longtime collaborator Donald Miles, professor of biological sciences at Ohio University, said Sinervo&#8217;s integrative perspective enabled him to see connections that broadened the impact of his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where other people would see bits of the puzzle, Barry would see the whole picture,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;He&#8217;s arguably one of the major contributors to our understanding of evolutionary processes and of species responses to climate change. He had a big impact not only with his publications but also through his teaching and the training workshops he organized in countries all over the world&#8212;he touched so many people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite his ongoing health challenges, Sinervo&#8217;s passing took many of his colleagues by surprise. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shock that he isn&#8217;t with us now,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;I was amazed how he was able to keep going&#8212;he was just having too much fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyon, who has been co-teaching a behavioral ecology field course with Sinervo for two decades, including the current quarter, said Sinervo was eager to continue working with students.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us were kind of in awe of his spirit and how he handled everything that happened to him with such grace. He never lost his infectious enthusiasm for science and natural history,&#8221; Lyon said.</p>
<p>In the past year, while continuing to teach and maintain ongoing research collaborations, Sinervo was also devoting much of his time to completing a digital textbook on animal behavior. When his voice gave out, his wife stepped in to narrate the lecture videos. The book, <a href="https://tophat.com/marketplace/science-&amp;-math/biology/full-course/behavioral-genetics-to-evolution-barry-sinervo-professor-of-ecology-and-evolution-university-of-california-santa-cruz/4400/"><em>Behavioral Genetics to Evolution</em></a>, was published in January by Top Hat Marketplace.</p>
<p>Sinervo is survived by his wife of 35 years Jeanie Vogelzang, son Ari Sinervo, sisters Kristiina Alariaq and Sirppa Sterling, and brothers Pekka Sinervo and Ken Sinervo.&#160;Donations in his memory may be made to <a href="https://350.org/">350.org</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d1dd6b0807270172c1b96bd50c32462"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Student Health Services Closed Dates during Spring Break 2021 </title><summary>Student Health Services—Student Health Center (SHC), Counseling and Psychological Services  (CAPS), Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion (SHOP) and Campus Advocacy Resources &amp;  Education (CARE) will be closed for mandatory staff trainings on the following dates/times during  Spring Break week.</summary><start-date>1616137200000</start-date><display-name> Student Health Services Closed Dates during Spring Break 2021 </display-name><path>/2021/03/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/news-article</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1616201504398</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616201504398</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Student Health Services&#8212;Student Health Center (SHC), Counseling and Psychological Services&#160; (CAPS), Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion (SHOP) and Campus Advocacy Resources &amp;&#160; Education (CARE) will be closed for mandatory staff trainings on the following dates/times during&#160; Spring Break week:&#160;</span></p>

The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/student-housing-west-approved.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616513151360000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFto8zGelebIOCPjsBXniQTT7vKoA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/student-housing-west-approved.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">approval of Student Housing West</a> is a huge win for our students, our employees and for the greater Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616513151360000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbv_2-AtL3-dHzztB7NmIUIizUFA" href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The project</a>, in the works for years, will provide campus with more desperately needed housing for our students, giving them more secure, affordable, on-campus housing options, as well as a child-care facility that will be open to all employees. Student Housing West will also draw an estimated 2,000 students currently living in the community back to campus, thereby easing pressure on the local housing market.</p>
<p>This project was first approved by Regents two years ago, then challenged in court. UCSC prevailed on many issues, but a judge concluded that there were errors in the process Regents used when they voted in support of Student Housing West, requiring the campus to return to the board. Today the Regents voted to once again approve this project.I am grateful for the support of Regents, who acknowledged the critical role housing plays in supporting student success, and appreciative of all who spoke passionately about the project. Mostly, though, I am happy for our students. Student Housing West, spread over two sites and comprising more than 3,000 beds, will enable our campus to offer more housing to our graduate students and our upper-division undergraduates. It will allow us to reduce overcrowding in existing residence halls and restore some of the lounge space we have converted to sleeping space in recent years to meet steep housing demand. It will create a new residential community for our students with families, situated within walking distance of the local elementary school and near the on-campus neighborhoods where we house our staff and faculty.</p>
<p>This infusion of additional housing as a whole will allow students to focus on their academics. They will not need to worry whether they&#8217;ll be able to find an affordable place to live while studying at UCSC. That is crucial to student success, which is one of our highest priorities.</p>
<p>Although the Student Housing West project debate has been a difficult one for our campus, I know we can find mutual respect in our common goal of doing what&#8217;s in the best interest of our campus &#8212; and especially our students.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of five new charter members of the initiative, joining seven other institutions around the country that announced their involvement in SEA Change in 2020.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging issues facing higher education today is cultivating diverse campus communities that are truly equitable, accessible, and inclusive. Achieving this goal has proven to be especially difficult in STEMM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), where bias, marginalization, and exclusion on the basis of gender (including identity and expression), race, ethnicity, disability status, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, age, familial history of higher education, as well as the intersections between these identities, have prevented the full engagement of all individuals.</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive highlighted the importance of qualitative improvements in diversity, equity, and inclusion by expanding a sense of belonging and creating pathways for support that are easy for students, faculty, and staff to navigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That's part of an inclusive climate: reducing the barriers to helping people access and get what they need from the university,&#8221; Larive said.</p>
<p>SEA Change&#8212;short for STEMM Equity Achievement&#8212;was launched in 2018 to support institutions as they undertake an in-depth self-assessment process to identify barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion for their students, faculty, and staff members. The institutions then create individualized plans to break down those barriers for those excluded or marginalized based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability status or any other aspect of identity that has been a source of bias in STEMM.</p>
<p>Many other programs in support of diversity, equity, and inclusion have similar goals, but the approaches differ significantly. SEA Change takes a systemic approach, rather than putting the onus on people who have faced discrimination or marginalization.</p>
<p>Through their self-examination and action planning, college and universities seek to improve upon their starting point&#8212;which is different for every institution. SEA Change charter members also join a growing community, one that values collaboration rather than competition as participants pursue their goals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5b1c7ea6807270172c1b96bd10bedaa0"><name>ocean-chemistry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes in ocean chemistry show how sea level affects global carbon cycle</title><summary>A new analysis of strontium isotopes reveals how the global carbon cycle has responded to changes in climate and sea level through geologic time.</summary><keywords>Adina Paytan</keywords><start-date>1616695200000</start-date><display-name>Changes in ocean chemistry show how sea level affects global carbon cycle</display-name><path>/2021/03/ocean-chemistry</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/ocean-chemistry</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1616436297352</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616697478715</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hfy7Pm4VX3E" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>450</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/carbonate-deposition-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/carbonate-deposition-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carbonate-deposition-450.jpg</name><display-name>carbonate-deposition-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>86808</file-size><width>450</width><height>696</height></image><image-alt>diagrams of different sea levels and deposition processes</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/marine-barite-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/marine-barite-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marine-barite-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>marine-barite-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15106</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>barite crystals</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>These illustrations show how changes in sea level affect carbonate deposition and other processes in the global carbon cycle.

<p>The results, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz9266">published March 26 in <em>Science</em></a>, provide new insights into the inner workings of the global carbon cycle and, in particular, the processes by which carbon is removed from the environment through the deposition of carbonates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strontium is very similar to calcium, so it gets incorporated into the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms,&#8221; explained lead author Adina Paytan, research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Paytan and her coauthors looked at the ratios of different isotopes of strontium, including radiogenic isotopes (produced by radioactive decay) and stable isotopes, which provide complementary information about geochemical processes. They found that the stable isotope ratio of strontium in the ocean has changed considerably over the past 35 million years, and it is still changing today, implying large changes in seawater strontium concentration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not in a steady state, so what&#8217;s coming into the ocean and what&#8217;s leaving don&#8217;t match,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;The strontium composition of seawater changes depending on how and where carbonates are deposited, and that is influenced by changes in sea level and climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fluctuations in strontium isotope ratios analyzed in this study reflect the combined effect of shifts in the global balance of geologic processes including weathering of rocks on land, hydrothermal activity, and the formation of carbonate sediments in both deep-sea and shallow, nearshore marine environments.</p>
<p><strong>Carbonate deposition</strong></p>
<p>Carbonate deposition in the open ocean comes from marine plankton like coccolithophores and foraminifera, which build their shells of the calcium carbonate mineral calcite. In shallow water on the continental shelves, hard corals are more abundant, and they build their skeletons of a different mineral of calcium carbonate, aragonite, which incorporates more strontium than calcite does.</p>
<p>&#8220;When corals form, they remove strontium, and when they are exposed, this strontium washes out and goes back into the ocean,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;With changes in sea level, more or less of the continental shelf where corals grow is exposed, so that impacts the strontium composition of seawater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carbonate deposition also feeds back into the climate system, because the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and carbonate deposition on geological timescales removes carbon from the system. The global carbon cycle and atmospheric carbon dioxide are tightly coupled to climate change, both in the long-term and during the recurring ups and downs of recent ice age cycles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new type of information we can read from the stable strontium isotopes now allows us to take a close look at the business end of the global carbon cycle, when carbon is removed from the environment and laid down into marine carbonate beds,&#8221; said coauthor Mathis Hain, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings throw open a new window to let us see how the global carbon cycle adjusted to sea level and climate change through geologic time,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We will need these insights in guiding our response to our current climate emergency and to mitigate the worst effects of ocean acidification."</p>
<p><strong>Marine barite</strong></p>
<p>The researchers were able to reconstruct a robust and detailed record of strontium isotope variations in seawater based on an analysis of marine barite extracted from deep-sea sediment cores.</p>
<p>"Records like this are critical to understanding how our earth operates over geologic times," said coauthor Elizabeth Griffith at Ohio State University. "Our international team worked together to both create this unique record and explain its significance through mathematical modeling, so we can reconstruct changes in the past when the climate conditions were different. The hope is to gain insight into how our blue planet might operate in the future."</p>
<p>In addition to Paytan, Hain, and Griffith, the coauthors of the paper include Anton Eisenhauer and Klaus Wallmann at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany, and Andrew Ridgwell at UC Riverside.

<p><span>An internationally recognized scholar and founding faculty member of UC Santa Cruz, Berger was known for a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary approach that goes far beyond traditional academic boundaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A revered literary and cultural critic, Berger published extensively over the years, with numerous books and more than 100 articles to his credit. In 2006, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span>Berger studied at Yale University, where he earned his B.A. and Ph.D. in English Literature and taught for 12 years. He came to UC Santa Cruz in 1965 where he taught a variety of subjects under the general category of culture theory and Renaissance culture, including Renaissance drama and Shakespeare. At Santa Cruz, he became interested In art history, specifically in Italian and Dutch painting and the theory and practice of portraiture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Berger's first laurels were earned through distinctive interpretations of Edmund Spenser's"The Faerie Queen," including his first book <i>The Allegorical Temper</i> (1957). Although much of his initial scholarship was in Renaissance poetry, particularly Spenser's work, Berger&#8217;s research and interests grew to encompass Dante, Plato, Freud, Marx, anthropology, metaphysics, and art history. According to the Academy of Arts and Sciences, &#8220;he helped to lead a generation of cultural critics to the conclusion that all narrative is rhetorical and pedagogic and not factual.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Harry was, as he used to say ironically, the &#8216;lead man&#8217; in the formation of Cowell College and of the Literature Department at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; noted&#160;</span><span>UCSC literature professors Karen Bassi, Deanna Shemek, and Marshall Leicester in a document supporting a 2010 campus celebration of his career.</span><span>&#160;&#8220;He was not only instrumental in the recruiting of their first faculty, but in the foundation and working-out of the then-new and still influential idea that a &#8216;board of study&#8217; could be so conceived and a residential College so organized, as intercommunicating cross-disciplinary entities.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;While he was championing UC Santa Cruz and keeping it going, Harry was also breaking new ground all over the intellectual map of the human sciences.&#8221; they added. &#8220;His record of productivity was extraordinary. He defined himself as a reader of texts, or what he disingenuously calls &#8216;an old-fashioned New Critic.&#8217; What this meant in practice is that he was one of the first in this country (or anywhere) to see that the techniques of close interpretation of literature that he learned to practice in his student days at Yale could be applied across the board in the human sciences and to the texts of culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Celebrated author, former <i>New Yorker</i> staff writer</strong>, and UC Santa Cruz alumnus Lawrence Weschler has described Berger as &#8220;one of our country&#8217;s finest, most penetrating and protean cultural critics and theorists.&#8221;<strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Weschler recalled the impact that Berger&#8217;s teaching and mentorship has had on him, ever since first encountering him as a freshman at Cowell College on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;First we had to learn how to read&#8230;close and deep and actively, dynamically, in a continuous, open-ended, dialectical dance with the text,&#8221; said Weschler. "And there was always more to learn&#8212;or so I&#8217;ve found in the decades since, as deep into my own career as an itinerant reporter, I continued to commune with Harry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And the marvels he could worry out of a text! And such a range of texts&#8212;Spencer, Shakespeare, Milton, Marvell, of course, but Plato, Dante, Theocritus, Beowulf, Pepys, Wordsworth and Frost. And not just texts, because he was a master at reading paintings, too: Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Vermeer, the Dutch still life masters, even Alice Neel. Deep looking: the slow reveal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;How we are going to miss him,&#8221; Weschler added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>&#8220;But then again not, since he remains so vitally present&#8212;that voice, the ever-penetrating insights, those gleams, that laugh&#8212;in the volumes he left us&#8230;.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Although he retired in the 1990s</strong>, Berger continued to teach classes as an emeritus professor at UC Santa Cruz, as well as lead seminars for faculty and students at such venues as the Folger Shakespeare Library, Yale, Newberry Library and the Shakespeare Society of America. He also continued to write numerous articles and completed over a dozen books, spurring the Modern Language Association in 2003 to dedicate a panel to his impact on literary studies.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, Fordham University Press published <i>A Touch More Rare: Harry Berger, Jr. and the Art of Interpretation</i>, co-edited by David Lee Miller, celebrating more than four decades of groundbreaking work by Berger. The book's 19 essays served as a tribute to a highly respected and incredibly productive literary and cultural critic.</span></p>
<p><span>"Although the breadth of Berger's work is awesome, he doesn't dabble," said Miller at the time. "When he turns to art history, he challenges and transforms the field's repertoire of methodologies; whatever his mind touches starts to glow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Miller also noted "the special ethos of Berger's work, which makes us all feel as if the world of scholarship might still turn out to be the kind of clean, well-lighted place we imagined it would be when we were still students, peering in from the outside and idealizing our teachers.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>

Regrettably, that change put us back where we were before: PIs<br/>routinely miss deadlines making OSP workload unmanageable and reducing their quality of<br/>service.</p>

With the acceleration in vaccinations, falling case rates, and optimism about the continued progress Santa Cruz County is making through the tiers, there is a widespread sense that public health conditions in the fall will support more in-person instruction than we foresaw on Feb. 25 when we provided guidance to divisions, departments, and faculty about fall instruction planning. The environment is changing rapidly, and the changes lead us to be more optimistic about our ability to offer in-person instruction in a way that continues to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our community.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased optimism in vaccinations and reduced spread have allowed us to plan for more in-person instruction in fall</li>
<li>Classes with enrollments below 150 can now be proposed for in-person scheduling (previously the threshold was 100)</li>
<li>Instructors should plan remote classes for Sept. 23 and 24, the first two days of classes, to facilitate COVID-19 testing, although this is subject to change</li>
<li>Remote enrollment opportunities, especially for first- and second-year students, will still be part of our planning</li>
</ul>
<p>As we have in all of our planning messages, we must note that plans are contingent upon public health conditions at the time of their implementation and are subject to change. There are still many unknowns and we will continue to closely monitor the situation and update our plans as needed.</p>
<p>All of our plans assume that by the start of the fall quarter there will be widespread availability of vaccines and few-to-no new daily cases within our campus community. We encourage you to get vaccinated when you are eligible. Based on recent <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616608442264000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwVvC0vH5bL-Sq6cxXERZOA3IJ8w" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CDC guidance</a>, it is anticipated that vaccinated individuals will be afforded more opportunities for returning to aspects of pre-pandemic life.</p>
<p><strong>Fall quarter instruction will be primarily in-person</strong></p>
<p>We expect most classes to be held in-person --- we are aiming for two-thirds to three-quarters of classes to be conducted in-person. The main area of exception is classes with enrollments of 150 or more students --- these courses will remain remote or online. For planning purposes, courses with enrollment below 150 students can now be scheduled in-person, with use of up to 100% room capacity, as space allows. The default mode of instruction for all courses with enrollment below 50 students will be in-person, with room capacities at 100%, though remote or online modality is possible by request of departments and colleges, and as needed to address requests for disability-related reasonable accommodation. A large class could be split into two offerings, one in-person offering of no more than 150 students and one remote offering.</p>
<p>Instructors and course sponsors may also consider hybrid courses within the 150-student constraint. For example, a 300-student class that meets two days a week could have pre-recorded lectures and have one in-person meeting each week for each half of the class to do in-person active learning exercises, and similarly a 450-student class meeting three days a week could be split into thirds. Faculty and course sponsors interested in this option should work closely with Online Education and the Office of the Registrar. Separate sections will need to be scheduled, one for each in-person cohort.</p>
<p>During this coming fall quarter we must be aware that not all students will begin or continue their education in person. While most medium-sized and smaller classes should be scheduled for in-person delivery, units should offer some courses online or remotely to enable remote students to make degree progress. In particular, departments and programs should provide pathways for fully remote first- and second-year students to make progress toward their major or major selection and qualification from afar. As noted above, departments, programs and instructors of record should be prepared to address requests for disability-related reasonable accommodation that may include remote instruction.</p>
<p>The opening of consulates and scheduling of visa appointments is also a dynamic situation at this time. While we remain cautiously optimistic, it is possible that some international students may not be able to attend in-person classes in the fall because of their inability to obtain a visa and/or enter the United States. International students are encouraged to consult with <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://global.ucsc.edu/news-events/global-engagement-covid-19-updates/isss.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616608442264000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6tCd6R339jc6Jc2EeMEGdzQIQ9g" href="https://global.ucsc.edu/news-events/global-engagement-covid-19-updates/isss.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS)</a> to evaluate their options and follow up with their department, college, or program.</p>
<p>With these changes in guidance, department and program chairs and college provosts should continue to work with instructors to determine the modalities of their courses. To the extent possible, chairs and provosts should accommodate instructor needs to teach remotely or online when these modalities are feasible for the achievement of course learning objectives and update the mode of instruction accordingly.</p>
<p>We anticipate that some public health measures will still be required in the fall, including some frequency of asymptomatic testing, the wearing of face coverings, and advice about frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizers. We will continue to align our plans with all public health requirements.</p>
<p>Instructors should plan to deliver classes on Sept. 23 and Sept. 24 remotely so that students and instructors have time to get tested after returning for the fall quarter. This element of our planning is under development and review, and may change.</p>
<p>Widespread vaccination is the critical element in our optimism about the fall. We must remain vigilant now, because the vast majority of our community is not yet vaccinated. Please continue to do your part to protect each other. We encourage you to follow the lead of our many on-campus student residents, who have opted to remain here on campus during spring break, to continue to slow the spread by not traveling and not mixing with larger communities.</p>
<p>Based on progress made in vaccinations and the lowering of infection rates, we are optimistic about our return to primarily in-person instruction in the fall. At the same time, we must be prepared to pivot to remote delivery of instruction should conditions warrant. This past year has profoundly impacted all of us. As we face the new challenges that fall will bring, we thank you for your flexibility, resilience, and partnership and for your commitment to the continued success of our students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor and Herbie Lee, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="613a6cab80727017480ce7261ef85256"><name>schneider-gina-eagle-scout</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Another glass ceiling shattered'</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz student Gina Schneider became a part of history as one of the first women in the U.S. to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.</summary><start-date>1616538600000</start-date><display-name>'Another glass ceiling shattered'</display-name><path>/2021/03/schneider-gina-eagle-scout</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/schneider-gina-eagle-scout</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1616538922123</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616538922123</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>womens-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/schneider-gina.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/schneider-gina.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>schneider-gina.jpg</name><display-name>schneider-gina.jpg</display-name><file-size>68743</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Schneider (Stevenson ’24, literature) was not only one of the first women in the U.S. to a</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/schneider-gina-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/schneider-gina-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>schneider-gina-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>schneider-gina-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3413</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Schneider (Stevenson ’24, literature) was not only one of the first women in the U.S. to a</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Schneider (Stevenson &#8217;24, literature) was not only one of the first women in the U.S. to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, but also among the approximately 6 percent of scouts who achieve the Scouts BSA&#8217;s highest level.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz student Gina Schneider became a part of history as one of the first women in the U.S. to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 18, UC Santa Cruz freshman Gina Schneider became a part of history as one of the first women in the U.S. to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an accomplishment she called &#8220;exciting,&#8221; not only because she couldn&#8217;t have imagined it as a little girl tagging along with her brother&#8217;s Cub Scout pack but also because it meant girls can now look forward to achieving a goal that had been out of reach for young women for much of the Boy Scouts of America&#8217;s 110-year history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It feels good to say I was one of the first,&#8221; said Schneider (Stevenson &#8217;24, literature) from her home in Fairfax, Calif. &#8220;I&#8217;m also excited for the generations to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider&#8217;s path to the Eagle Scout rank was full of highs (camping, camaraderie, and learning outdoor skills) and lows (being told that, because she was a girl and her brother had graduated to the Boy Scouts, she could no longer hang out with his troop).&#160; She felt what she described as &#8220;a deep-rooted anger&#8221; that a door had been slammed in her face and she could do nothing about it. At 14, she was able to join a Venturing Crew, which is a co-ed scouting program that included backpacking, canoeing, and sailing trips along with other Boy Scouts skills. Still, it wasn&#8217;t the same, said Schneider. For one thing, while plenty of people have heard of Eagle Scouts&#8212;presidents, sports figures, and business leaders have claimed the rank&#8212;few knew of the Venturing program&#8217;s top award, called Summiting, despite the fact it had some of the same requirements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the Boy Scouts of America decided to admit girls and changed its name to Scout BSA. The problem was that Schneider would age out of the program before she could complete the requirements for the top rank, which usually takes four or five years to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fellow member of Troop 1015 in San Anselmo, however&#8212;Jordan Locke of San Rafael&#8212;petitioned the Marin Council, which then took two resolutions to the National meeting later that year and was instrumental in getting extensions for all young women who had been members of scouting as of October 2017 and would age out before February 8, 2021. Schneider and three young women from her troop shifted into high gear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was really impressed how they wrapped their arms around it [the goal] and went for it,&#8221; said Lisa Linnenkohl, Schneider&#8217;s scoutmaster and an executive board member on the Marin Council of Scouts BSA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Scouts BSA website, only about 6 percent of scouts achieve the group&#8217;s highest rank. The award requires a candidate, among other things, to be a leader for six months and earn at least 21 merit badges in subjects like communication, first aid, business and the environment, and civics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four young women studied and practiced the skills needed to earn their merit badges. They camped together every weekend and spent two weeks at Scout camp. The COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 didn&#8217;t make things any easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was exciting and pretty fast-paced,&#8221; Schneider said of those busy two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of her requirements, Schneider also planned, organized, and completed a community service project to decommission an illegal trail in a 62-acre community park in San Anselmo. The illicit path was causing erosion and washing silt into a nearby creek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in February, Schneider joined nearly 1,000 other young women across the U.S. who were awarded the rank of Eagle Scout, according to the Scouts BSA website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment was bittersweet for Schneider. While she had reached her goal, she said, she felt the loss of not having something to reach for with her friends.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider is now focused on her studies at UC Santa Cruz, where her mother, Karen White Schneider (Cowell '86, art history), was a talented player on the rugby team. Schneider said she hopes to teach either high school literature or science someday.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being an Eagle Scout means a lot,&#8221; said Schneider.&#160; &#8220;It means having leadership opportunities and being dedicated and having experiences, and just forging a path for women and girls.&#8221;</span></p>

meaningful change for students of color and become a key part of the university community
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1980s, African American students at UC Santa Cruz were losing patience.They were not feeling supported by the campus and had grown tired of advocating for themselves. The 21 percent six-year graduation rate for African American students underscored the challenges they faced.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of desperation, student protesters peacefully surrounded the Hahn building, demanding the administration make meaningful change for students of color at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then&#8211;Student Services Vice Chancellor Bruce Moore met with the student leaders and negotiated a solution. On April 1, 1991, UC Santa Cruz alumna Sister Paula Livers-Powell (M.A. '89, history) became the new assistant dean of African American student life, starting what would become the African American Resource and Cultural Center. This year, the center celebrates its 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anniversary as a key part of the university community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was like a prayer answered for the students,&#8221; said Livers-Powell, who served in the capacity of founding director for 21 years and retired from the university in 2010. She now pursues her passion as a genealogist and founder/publisher of BlackbytheBay.com.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, African American students have a dramatically improved six-year graduation rate of 65.6 percent, more than triple what it was, and UC Santa Cruz continues to focus on student success with a goal of eliminating achievement gaps and improving graduation rates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livers-Powell said the connections, encouragement, and programs the center offers have played a big role in achieving that higher rate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Advancing student involvement and success</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located today on the third floor of the Bay Tree Building within the Ethnic Resource Centers, the center facilitates student involvement and success on campus. It has worked closely with or supported numerous groups at the university, including the African/Black Student Alliance, the National Society of Black Engineers, the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/aatat-30th-anniversary.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Theater Arts Troupe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, the center continues on with a variety of virtual programs, including Black Academy, Black in STEM talks, and career workshops.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been kind of good and hard at the same time,&#8221; said interim director Riana Howard, who just started in the position in July. &#8220;We&#8217;ve accomplished a lot being remote. But I haven&#8217;t met a lot of our students yet, who I would have met if I were on campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nailah Smith (Stevenson '24, computer science), a first-year student and employee of the center, said she loved AARCC&#8217;s recent virtual Black in STEM workshop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It helped me get connected to other students in my major,&#8221; said Smith, who is studying computer science.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryleigh Hales (Merrill '21, biochemistry and molecular biology), another student employee of AARCC, said she loved attending Black Academy, which provides an orientation to the university, shortly after she transferred in fall 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She appreciated meeting other Black students and learning about ways she could get involved in college life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer that if you benefit, you should give back,&#8221; said Hales. &#8220;I wanted to be part of the team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Black Academy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Academy, now entering its sixth year, has served some 200 students and has helped connect them with mentors and gain a better understanding of how to achieve success on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/jones-aaron-profile.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who worked under the guidance of former AARCC director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shont&#233;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thomas (Rachel Carson '99, politics) to start the program, said he met with many students to help figure out what they needed and overcome obstacles keeping them from finishing their degrees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said African American students and other minoritized populations need extra support because &#8220;fundamentally higher education was constructed for particular folk.&#8221; Higher education has not historically been inclusive, he said. &#8220;There is a need for folks that have been historically marginalized&#8212;they need spaces on campus where they can feel comfortable, where they can recharge.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas, who served as director of AARCC for seven years and now serves as associate dean of students for ethnic and gender centers at UC Riverside, said anti-Blackness permeates the world. Unfortunately, she had a bad experience at UC Santa Cruz as an undergraduate, facing explicit racial biases on a regular basis until she graduated in 1999.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, she was at first reluctant to take on the job leading AARCC, but as she continued, she was glad to be in the job so that she could help improve the lives of not just the constituency but everyone in the university as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remind folks this is freedom work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Solidarity and the way we move together so all folks get to a true sense of equity. That is the aim and goal however we get there. That will only happen when all groups are respectful of one another and they have a sense of love and affection for their fellow people.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She counts the founding of Black Academy as one of her top achievements, along with the fact that during her time at AARCC, more African American students showed up at the lounge to have fun and enjoy being with each other. She worked hard to make the center a home away from home for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really moved with a sense of &#8216;if you want to be here, you can be here,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to contribute seven years of all I could to build our students up.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A village and a vision</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, Livers-Powell, the founding director, said it took a village and a vision to support the mission of the AARCC. She appreciated the help and support of former staff such as&#160;Founding&#160;Assistant Director Nancy James-Williams, Duane "Coach" Gardner, and Founding Program Director Kristine O'Neil, the office manager who helped to lay the foundation seen today.&#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livers-Powell also feels blessed to have had dedicated AARCC interns, ambassadors, student organizations, faculty, staff, and community allies who contributed to the 30-year legacy of the AARCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livers-Powell never imagined when she started the center that social media would be invented and that she would be able to keep in touch with the students supported by the center. Now when she looks on those sites, she is proud and impressed to see former UC Santa Cruz students sharing their success stories as alumni in a variety of professional endeavors including photographers, writers, lawyers, doctors, and many other careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s like growing a garden, being a constant gardener, and now you see the flourishing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The seeds keep coming.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/jones-aaron-profile.html</url><title>Listening and bringing change</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/aatat-30th-anniversary.html</url><title>Troupe dynamic</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a3dba3280727017480ce726468521c6"><name>dean-graduate-studies-finalist</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Finalists for Dean of Graduate Studies making virtual campus visits</title><summary>Starting Thursday, April 1, five finalists for the position of Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies will be visiting our campus virtually. </summary><start-date>1616569200000</start-date><display-name>Finalists for Dean of Graduate Studies making virtual campus visits</display-name><path>/2021/03/dean-graduate-studies-finalist</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/dean-graduate-studies-finalist</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1616690133517</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616690133517</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am happy to announce that starting Thursday, April 1, five finalists for the position of Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies will be visiting our campus virtually.

<p>Much of that time has been with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu">Educational Partnership Center</a>, which increases access to higher education for underrepresented students across the Monterey Bay, Pajaro Valley, and Silicon Valley. The EPC helps educationally-disadvantaged students in the region reach and succeed in college.</p>
<p>As a first-generation college student herself and a UC Santa Cruz alumna, Ortiz has spent years talking with the students about the benefits of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We say, &#8216;You will have more stability, which offers you a better quality of life,&#8217;&#8221; Ortiz said. &#8220;You can build a better life for yourself and your future family, if that&#8217;s what you want. You&#8217;ll be able to support your family or help your parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly after graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 2001, Ortiz got a job helping with programing at Oakes College. She then moved to the Educational Partnership Center and began doing outreach with high school students all over the Monterey Bay region. She is currently serving as the interim assistant director for <a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/programs/gearup/">GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs)</a> in Watsonville and the Pajaro Valley.</p>
<p>GEAR UP offers tutoring, college and career centers, college/educational field trips, academic advising and financial aid information. The services are important to local students because many have no experience with the university/post-secondary systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t necessarily have the knowledge to get to college,&#8221; Ortiz said. &#8220;They need someone to walk them through and help them understand the bureaucracy because often they are the first in their families to be going through this experience. Our programs bridge the cultural capital and resources needed to navigate post-secondary systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ortiz can relate to their experience. Her parents immigrated from El Salvador and didn&#8217;t know how the university system worked. However, they always valued education and made sure their three children knew the importance of academics.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they raised and brought us up, they emphasized that we do well in school and focus on school,&#8221; she said. &#8220;School came first. My dad wouldn&#8217;t buy us a Nintendo because it would take away from our study time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a high school student in Los Angeles, she took part in the Early Outreach Academic Program and followed the advice she was given about how to prepare for university. It also helped that her two older sisters went to college.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having seen them do it, then it was more attainable,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Now, as an employee of UC Santa Cruz, Ortiz finds that one of the biggest challenges of doing outreach with high school students is helping families see post-secondary education as an attainable option for them. Many families are worried about their children drowning in student loans. She tries to assure them that there are options for financial aid.</p>
<p>Doing outreach has become even more challenging with the onset of the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic. Like all other university programs, everything has moved online. GEAR UP staff have been able to conduct workshops virtually using Google Meets or Zoom. They have also set up virtual college visits, tutoring and academic advising.</p>
<p>The transition to online interaction was made easier by the center&#8217;s the long-term relationships with high schools, Ortiz said. It underscores what she&#8217;s always known&#8212;that partnerships with the community are everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the relations we build are super critical,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those relationships form opportunities for our students. That&#8217;s what it all boils down to&#8212;what opportunity and experience are we able to offer our students.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a55b28480727017480ce726dae382cb"><name>esa-fellows-2021</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz faculty recognized for excellence in ecology</title><summary>The Ecological Society of America announced its 2021 Fellow and Early Career Fellow awards, and UC Santa Cruz’s faculty were the most decorated of any university on this year’s list.  &#13;

style="font-weight: 400;">The Ecological Society of America (ESA) recently announced its 2021 ESA Fellow awards, which recognize scientists who have made outstanding contributions to the field, and UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s faculty were the most decorated of any university on this year&#8217;s list.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 class of inductees included researchers from 29 institutions across the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Four UC Santa Cruz faculty members were honored among the 25 ESA Fellow awardees and 10 Early Career Fellow winners.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Ingrid Parker, of UCSC&#8217;s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, was recognized as an ESA Fellow this year for her research on the ongoing conservation impacts of biological invasions. She works in close partnership with resource managers to conserve biological diversity through invasive species removal and ecosystem restoration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parker discovered her passion for this work while she was an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz in the 1980s. She credits that experience with helping to set the path for much of what she has accomplished today, including her ESA Fellow award.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got my start here at UC Santa Cruz, and I think this is such an amazing place for biodiversity studies and ecology,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I always have felt incredibly lucky to get to come back here and be a professor, and I hope this recognition will reflect on the quality of our institution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl was also excited to be recognized as a 2021 ESA Fellow alongside UCSC colleagues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it is a strong statement about the caliber of ecological research that we&#8217;re doing here,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl&#8217;s award was based in part on her leadership in long-term monitoring efforts, including around forest restoration and improving the effectiveness of tree-growing campaigns. Her nomination recognizes her work in &#8220;bringing science into decision making,&#8221; through effective communication with policymakers and the media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel strongly that if I&#8217;m going to spend all of this time collecting data, it&#8217;s important to put that to public service to help people and the ecosystems on which they depend,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Science is not just an academic exercise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies Professor Stacy Philpott&#8212;who&#8217;s also the Ruth &amp; Alfred Heller Endowed Chair in Agroecology and the director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems&#8212;was proud to earn an ESA Fellow award this year as a representative of agroecology&#8217;s important role within the field. Much of Philpott&#8217;s research focuses on the role of insects in agricultural ecosystems, but her nomination also recognized her special dedication to teaching and mentorship, particularly for women and students of color.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s really nothing more exciting than seeing an undergraduate student publish their first paper, get into grad school, or get a job doing ecological research that they're really excited about,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Especially when it comes to promoting young women in science and students of color, who have been so dramatically underrepresented in ecology.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philpott hopes ecologists will continue working to bring more diversity and inclusion to the field, including through developing more equitable collaborations with people in the global south and with environmental justice and food sovereignty movements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Kai Zhu, who was honored as an Early Career Fellow this year, said he felt particularly proud to accept that recognition as an Asian ecologist. During a time when anti-Asian violence has been on display across the country, he wants all people of color to feel safe and valued within the ecology community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that my election to the program will help to promote Asian ecologists and members of other minority communities to achieve the same level of success as anyone else in ecology,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhu&#8217;s award was based on his blending of classical ecological theories with modern computational tools to study global issues like climate change. He hopes the field will continue to find new ways to embrace big data and explore interdisciplinary questions. And now, he and his fellow ESA awardees have a new leadership platform to help shape ecology's</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It feels exciting to be recognized by the Ecological Society of America,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tremendous honor, and it&#8217;s very inspiring for me as a young scientist.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6b26da9880727017480ce7267c55f8a3"><name>zavaleta-appointment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC ecologist Erika Zavaleta appointed to California Fish and Game Commission</title><summary>Governor Gavin Newsom has appointed Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, to the California Fish and Game Commission. </summary><start-date>1616655600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC ecologist Erika Zavaleta appointed to California Fish and Game Commission</display-name><path>/2021/03/zavaleta-appointment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/zavaleta-appointment</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1616705411707</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1616705817968</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</name><display-name>erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>76578</file-size><width>350</width><height>388</height></image><image-alt>Erika Zavaleta</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23592</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Erika Zavaleta</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Erika Zavaleta (photo by Matt Kroll)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Governor Gavin Newsom has appointed Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, to the California Fish and Game Commission.</p>
<p>Zavaleta will be one of five members of the commission, which has a wide range of responsibilities, setting policies and regulations to be implemented and enforced by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. This position requires Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to supporting world-class wildlife stewardship in our amazing state and bringing science to bear on regulatory decisions,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;I am also excited to contribute to the commission&#8217;s efforts to broaden access to natural spaces and wildlife for all Californians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavaleta has worked with a wide range of government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, land managers, and community members to connect strong science to effective conservation solutions. Her research focuses on terrestrial ecosystems and plant communities, links between biodiversity and human well-being, and the implications of interacting global and regional environmental changes. She coauthored the award-winning textbook <em>Ecosystems of California</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commission has great authority over many aspects of California&#8217;s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine resource management and conservation policies,&#8221; said Mark Carr, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. &#8220;Historically, there has not been strong science or diversity representation on the commission, and Erika&#8217;s appointment represents a marked change in the composition of the commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, Zavaleta is a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and the Ecological Society of America. Dedicated to mentoring future leaders in ecology and conservation, she directs the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a> at UCSC and the <a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/">Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-based Opportunities (CAMINO)</a>, a program to increase student access to research-based field courses and internships at UCSC.</p>
<p>Zavaleta earned her B.A. and M.A. in anthropology and a Ph.D. in biological sciences at Stanford University. She joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2003.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7f4baac280727017480ce72692593c18"><name>adolescent-gender-sexual-identity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Teens describe their gender and sexuality in diverse new ways, but some are being left behind</title><summary>Psychology Professor Phil Hammack’s latest research shows how regional differences and other social factors can either hinder or support expression of diversity in sexual and gender identity among teens and young adults.</summary><start-date>1617001200000</start-date><display-name>Adolescent Gender And Sexual Identity</display-name><path>/2021/03/adolescent-gender-sexual-identity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/adolescent-gender-sexual-identity</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1617043368604</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617056230744</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/adolescent-identity-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/adolescent-identity-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adolescent-identity-450.jpg</name><display-name>adolescent-identity-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>77101</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Young adults gathered outdoors at an event, some participants are wearing rainbow flags</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/adolescent-identity-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/adolescent-identity-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adolescent-identity-80.jpg</name><display-name>adolescent-identity-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23566</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Young adults gathered outdoors at an event, some participants are wearing rainbow flags</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of teens and young adults identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.

But not everyone is participating equally in these diverse forms of expression, according to new research from the University of California, Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology Professor Phillip Hammack&#8217;s latest paper, published in the </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07435584211000315"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Adolescent Research</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is shedding light on the social factors that can either hinder or support expression of diversity in sexual and gender identity among teens and young adults.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the language is finally evolving to represent the actual diversity of experience that exists,&#8221; Hammack said. &#8220;On the one hand, teens seem much more liberated and have a much more expansive vocabulary than previous generations, but you also still have these unresolved issues around things like masculinity. So that was the real shock to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the paper found that regional differences and pressures to conform to masculinity may have a dampening effect on diversity of expression.&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Identifying regional differences<strong>&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammack&#8217;s research focused on teens between the ages of 14 and 18, who are among the younger members of Generation Z. Researchers wanted an in-depth understanding of these young people&#8217;s experiences, so they performed detailed research at a small number of field sites in the San Francisco Bay Area and California&#8217;s Central Valley.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sites were selected to represent higher and lower levels of resources, rights, and visibility for sexual and gender diversity. Within these communities, researchers surveyed 314 LGBTQ+ teens and conducted extensive interviews with 28 LGBTQ+ youth informants and 24 adult LGBTQ+ leaders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost a quarter of all LGBTQ+ youth surveyed expressed some form of nonbinary gender, and use of they/them pronouns was common. But there was a difference of more than 11 percentage points in the proportion of youth expressing nonbinary gender identity in the Bay Area compared to the Central Valley. Some study participants told researchers that, while they felt diverse sexuality is becoming more broadly normalized, gender diversity is still less accepted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was hard to hear all of the difficulties that the participants were going through and challenges with not feeling safe being out or having access to the resources they needed,&#8221; said Julianne Atwood, a coauthor on the paper who conducted field interviews with Central Valley participants. &#8220;It&#8217;s tough being a queer person in a rural community, but it does get better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found that there was less open discussion of sexual diversity in Central Valley communities compared to the Bay Area, but in this case, there was no corresponding difference in diversity of sexuality labeling. Study participants often mentioned finding information through the internet and social media, rather than their geographic communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being online is kind of like the great equalizer for LGBTQ youth, and I think that benefits them all tremendously,&#8221; Hammack said.</span></p>
<h3>The pressures of masculinity</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also noticed that teens who were assigned female at birth seemed more comfortable with diverse forms of gender expression. Among teens in the study group who identified with a nonbinary gender label, 78.7 percent were assigned female at birth. There were also notably more transgender boys in the study than transgender girls.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During interviews, study participants consistently shared stories of how those who were assigned male at birth faced strong pressures to conform to standards of masculinity. Accounts of violence against transgender women of color were common in interviews, along with other fears that it might not be safe for those assigned male at birth to express nonconforming gender or sexual identities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammack said he believes harmful &#8220;regulation of masculinity&#8221; may stem from feelings of insecurity among boys as gender hierarchies are being challenged. The paper&#8217;s documentation of these trends will be an important contribution to the future of LGBTQ+ research and support, said Stephen Russell, a prominent sociologist and professor at the University of Texas at Austin who served as a scientific advisor on the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know that I&#8217;ll cite this work for the way they link gender normativity and the pressures of masculinity for boys,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;There are different imperatives and possibilities for young people if they are assigned female at birth or if they&#8217;re assigned male at birth, and this shows what that means for how they can understand themselves in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Reaching teens across labels<strong>&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, perceptions of gender and sexuality labels can affect which types of resources and support are most accessible for teens. For example, Hammack said that cisgender gay males in the research areas were noticeably missing from LGBTQ+ support groups, which may indicate that these spaces are being perceived as &#8220;feminine.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the study found that some identity labels are racialized in ways that may make boys of color less likely to identify with them. But targeted recruitment efforts could help LGBTQ+ support groups for teens to better reflect the true diversity of the community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammack hopes his research might offer a window into that diversity to create greater acceptance and recognition across all labels.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually been trying to shift my speech away from saying LGBTQ+, with that uncomfortable plus sign, because there are so many identities that are not captured within that label,&#8221; Hammack said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about these issues instead as phenomena of sexual and gender diversity, and I&#8217;d like to see more researchers and educators recognizing those nuances within the community.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7fa2871c80727017480ce726678e58b6"><name>covid-hero-miller</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Health center pivots to provide services through pandemic</title><summary>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center had to quickly change everything it was doing while remaining open for students.&#13;

<p>That meant the launch of a new telehealth program, determination, acquisition of protective personal equipment for the staff, and constant education on the new virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Elizabeth Miller, the center&#8217;s medical director, said she had never before experienced this much change at once in her career. Fortunately, she said she and most of the center&#8217;s staff had trained their whole lives for this type of situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re never completely prepared,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But all of us here, we very quickly knew what had to be done to maintain clinic safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller said the health center had been talking for some time about the need to start a telehealth service but the pandemic spurred action. She credited Dr. Sandy Lai, the center&#8217;s associate medical director, and Frank Dang, clinical information systems analyst, for getting the program going &#8211; they purchased Google Chromebooks, set up templates for the medical providers and got everyone up to speed on how to use Zoom.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been so well received that we&#8217;ll always offer Zoom appointments, because the students really like them,&#8221; Miller said.</p>
<p>The pandemic also led the health center to reorganize its space for the few students who did need in-person appointments. The center rerouted how patients walked through the clinic so they would avoid others, and converted a conference room into waiting room for those who were sick.</p>
<p>A big issue was determining what personal protective equipment to get and how much to get, Miller said. The center also had to train staff how to protect themselves and patients. Everyone started using the new protocols of wearing masks in the building, socially distancing, using hand sanitizer, and washing hands more frequently. To date, no clinical staff have tested positive for the COVID&#8211;19 virus.</p>
<p>The next major hurdle was to work with the UC Santa Cruz Molecular Diagnostic Lab to create a parking lot clinic where people could be tested for the COVID&#8211;19 virus. Eventually other testing sites were established around the campus. Since March 2020, the university has had just over 200 positive tests and the vast majority were from symptomatic patients. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s really good,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Our positivity rate is very low. It has always been lower than the county.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking back over the last year, Miller said one of the biggest challenges was staying updated on COVID&#8211;19 regulations and advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information comes from everywhere and a lot of times is conflicting,&#8221; she said, adding that state, county or other changing regulations have caused revisions. &#8220;Sometimes, Monday we will start a new policy and by Thursday it&#8217;s changed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic has shown the kindness and thoughtfulness of the campus community, she said, praising students who have taken seriously masking and socially distancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every student that I have talked with and in the beginning, I talked to every student who was positive, they&#8217;ve also taken it seriously and have been concerned with housemates, roommates, parents and grandparents,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Some have even apologized for coming to the clinic and potentially getting staff sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller is proud that UC Santa Cruz as a community has risen to the challenge of times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has their role and has done a great job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really proud of my staff here and I&#8217;m so proud of the students and so honored to work in this university with its wonderful administrators and leaders.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7fae975780727017480ce7263bd68706"><name>keynote-summer-orientation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus launches credit-bearing summer orientation</title><summary>The Slug Orientation courses will orient students to our campus and to university life, while promoting community-building and effective habits of mind for academic success. </summary><start-date>1617001200000</start-date><display-name>Orientation update</display-name><path>/2021/03/keynote-summer-orientation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/keynote-summer-orientation</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1617049851704</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617206383690</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Richard Hughey</name><title>Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education </title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/hughey-richard-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/hughey-richard-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hughey-richard-400.jpg</name><display-name>hughey-richard-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>102701</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Richard Hughey</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>
<p>I am delighted to announce the 2021 launch of credit-bearing summer orientation.</p>
<p>The ten versions of College 1A <em>Introduction to University Life and Learning</em> for new frosh, and Kresge 1T <em>Introduction to Research Universities and the Liberal Arts</em> for new transfer students, will orient students to our campus and to university life, while promoting community-building and effective habits of mind for academic success. College 1A will emphasize introduction to the Academic Literacy Curriculum and higher learning success, while 1T will promote an effective transition to research universities and the liberal arts.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, UC Santa Cruz has been on the leading edge of UC and the nation in ensuring access, consistency, and success through innovation in its orientation program. The work across a multitude of offices across campus, led by Orientation Director Rosa Plaza, to shift summer orientation to an online format proved effective in increasing knowledge delivery and retention by spreading the material over the entire summer; improving effectiveness while simultaneously reducing workload; and moving orientation into the digital era. For me, one of the most important impacts has been on access, as no longer do families need to decide between the high cost and lost wages of a multi-day trip to Santa Cruz, or a 4 a..m. to 11 p.m. day trip north. Although not planned, the 2019 shift to online summer orientation positioned our campus well to face challenges brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Council of Provosts (following their successful work with the Writing Program and Academic Senate on the initial steps of engaged scholarship, the joint Academic Literacy Curriculum) have worked closely among themselves, with Campus Orientation, and with the Academic Senate, to tie together the learning objectives of summer orientation and existing or revised summer academic engagement with fall&#8217;s College 1.</p>
<p>Kresge Provost Ben Leeds Carson, Professor of Music, and Crown Provost Manel Camps, Professor of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, have led development of the new integrated courses and their learning objectives. With the Committee on Courses of Instruction (CCI) approval, each college has tuned aspects of the curriculum to their own unique college, to fully integrate the remote course with the living and learning community.</p>
<p>The courses have many goals and learning objectives, including introduction to the campus, demystification of the &#8220;hidden curriculum&#8221;, beginning to address inequities in preparedness, starting to build a sense of belonging to the campus and the student community, and building intellectual momentum.</p>
<p>The course is a collaboration among a multitude of units and offices, including the Council of Provosts, Campus Orientation, Office of Campus Advising Coordination, Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students, Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid and Scholarships, The Division of Student Affairs and Success, Office of the Registrar, Summer Session, Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services, Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion, Student Health Center, Business and Administrative Services, academic programs and departments across campus, academic and institutional support units across campus, and the Academic Senate.</p>
<p>As a unit-bearing summer course, completion will place students a small step toward completing the required 180 units. As with other summer session courses, there is tuition ($279) associated with the course, but there is no longer an orientation fee. Chancellor Cynthia Larive has waived the campus fee for students taking just this 1-unit course during summer, and the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships will provide an Orientation Grant fully covering this tuition to the 50% of students with &#8220;financial need.&#8221; For the first year, in support of this important new program, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer will provide scholarships to all remaining students covering half of the tuition. No additional application or paperwork will be needed for either of these grants.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking the many people who have worked to make UC Santa Cruz Orientation a transformative course experience for our students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="840dff8180727017480ce726362a0bd1"><name>citl-fifth-anniversary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marking fifth year, Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning plays vital role in campus mission</title><summary>The center will celebrate its fifth anniversary April 14 with a convocation featuring Estela Bensimon, professor of higher education at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education and director of the Center for Urban Education, which she founded in 1999.&#13;

<p>The center, now celebrating its fifth anniversary, has played a vital role in providing resources and research to faculty to aid them in redesigning their classes for the new reality.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 to continue and refresh the university&#8217;s long tradition of educational experimentation, CITL&#8217;s goal is to help educators and students thrive through use of the latest research and educational technologies.</p>
<p>Susan Strome, a professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology, said working with CITL has been transformative for her. Because of advice she received through CITL, she redesigned her syllabus to be more engaging and welcoming. She emphasized that she believes all students can succeed, and she outlined what she will do in partnership with students to help them achieve their goals. CITL also provided critical guidance in how to redesign her course for remote instruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;CITL is having a profound impact on teaching on campus,&#8221; Strome said, adding that many faculty members have looked to the center for help on offering remote instruction classes. &#8220;When we go back to in-person instruction, we will be better instructors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the last year, CITL&#8212;in close collaboration with Online Education and Information Technology Services&#8212;has offered numerous webinars and a teaching newsletter with ideas on such things as how to manage Zoom classes, incorporate videos, provide inclusive teaching and how to facilitate active learning. CITL also provided information on how to offer trauma-informed teaching. Faculty were encouraged to regularly ask students how they are doing during the pandemic and to ask about their needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is have everyone learn,&#8221; said Jody Greene, the center&#8217;s founding director and associate vice provost for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, it was harder to get faculty engaged with the center&#8217;s efforts because they were so busy with their many responsibilities, Greene said. Understandably, they didn&#8217;t have endless hours to rethink how to run their courses. But with the onset of COVID&#8211;19, everyone had to rethink how they run their courses. Greene said she&#8217;s pleased to hear that Strome and many professors felt they benefited from the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re real clear on what you want students to learn and you design what you do in class and how you affect their learning in an intentional way, then you&#8217;re going to get a lot more learning than out of a really entertaining performance,&#8221; as one example, Greene said.</p>
<p>Because of encouragement from CITL, some professors have been willing to try things they never have before&#8212;like allowing students to retake exams until they got it right. The idea is to stop using tests as a way to sort students into &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad,&#8221; and to instead use them as assessments to help students learn.</p>
<p>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, an astronomy professor, said that the way UC Santa Cruz approaches teaching and evaluates teaching can be divided before or after CITL.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has changed the mentality around here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s generated a really beautiful, supportive, intellectually brilliant community of learners and teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, who has been a CITL fellow for many years, particularly appreciates how the center encourages professors to be better mentors to students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good teaching, good mentoring practices are going to be rewarded and are essential to the way people are promoted,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said CITL has also played an important role in getting departments to look at where they are losing students of color, and to take steps to correct that problem.</p>
<p>CITL will celebrate its fifth anniversary April 14 with a <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_jOG1T-7yQtqpqbaZWI5n4A">convocation featuring Estela Bensimon</a>, professor of higher education at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education and director of the Center for Urban Education, which she founded in 1999.</p>
<p>Bensimon is known nationally and internationally for her role in promoting equity in higher education. She developed a toolkit, which Strome used, to help faculty redesign their syllabuses in a more inclusive way.</p>
<p>Bensimon asks faculty members to be race-conscious and to pay attention to how minoritized students do on homework assignments. As an example, Latinx students in a class might have good attendance but might not be handing in homework because they think its optional.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of this is hidden curriculum,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about making everything transparent so that everyone has an opportunity to navigate the course expectations and succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bensimon also encourages faculty members to look at the strengths of minoritized populations. For example, faculty members should become conscious of the collaborative skills from communities less individualist than white culture. &#8220;She&#8217;s very adamant about a strengths-based approach,&#8221; Greene said.</p>
<p>Greene hopes people who hear Bensimon&#8217;s talk will come away inspired to continue working with CITL and the many partners with whom they closely collaborate to improve teaching and support equitable outcomes for students on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;CITL is not changing teaching but changing the culture of teaching,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is something we expect people will develop over the course of their careers.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8419c45e80727017480ce7263eea2ee2"><name>spring-quarter-transportation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring quarter transportation options</title><summary>Spring has sprung, Slugs, and TAPS is here to help you get where you need to go this quarter. &#13;

Keep reading for important transportation reminders like bike programs, electric vehicle charging, transit updates, and parking permit renewals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Bike Programs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s nothing better than riding through campus on a spring day and seeing the greenery and wildlife. But what if you don&#8217;t have a bike? TAPS can help with that!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrow a bike from the </span><a href="http://bikelibrary.weebly.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bike Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at no cost. Your spring-quarter bike check-out even comes with a helmet and a lock to keep you and your bike safe. </span><a href="http://bikelibrary.weebly.com/apply.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications close April 2nd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so apply now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff and Faculty are also eligible for 0% interest bike loans. You can get up to </span><strong>$750</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward a traditional bike or </span><strong>$1,500</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward an e-bike. </span><a href="https://ecoact.org/membership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about applying here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>

<p><strong>Walking</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring is perfect for getting out and exploring campus. Put on some walking shoes and check out the pathways and trails on campus. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/walking-map.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our walking map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even gives the walking time between key locations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicles</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can now charge your electric vehicle under the East Remote lot solar array! There&#8217;s affordable Level 2 charging via Chargepoint AND Level 1 trickle charging via ParkMobile. We&#8217;ve also added Level 1 charging to the 6th floor of the Core West parking structure. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/electric-vehicle-charging.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit our website for more information.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Please Note: As of April 5th, R, C, or FSH permits will no longer be eligible to charge in the Core West parking structure and will have to charge in the East Remote lot or at Lot 201 on the Coastal Science Campus (valid permit for CSC required)</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t have an electric vehicle? Getting one is easier than you think! In addition to federal, state, and local tax rebates, UCSC affiliates are eligible for dealer discounts. Programs are even available for low-income staff and students. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/electric-vehicles.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit our Electric Vehicle Offers and Rebates page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for current offers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Transit Updates</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus shuttles will continue on the same schedule as winter quarter through spring. Night Core service will be on-demand by calling (831) 459-2829. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/buses-shuttles/campus-shuttles.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the most recent Campus Transit schedules here.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz METRO has reduced fares through September 25th, including Highway 17 Express for only $3.50! </span><a href="https://www.scmtd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about METRO&#8217;s reduced fares here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Students can continue to ride METRO buses fare-free within the county with validator stickers from winter 2020 through spring 2021.</span></p>
<p><strong>Parking Permits</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With spring comes 2021-2022 permit renewals. Employees can renew their permits beginning May 1st, and student renewals begin in mid-May (date will be announced in April). </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/application-instructions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permit applications will be available here.</span></a></p>
<p><strong><i>For employees on payroll deductions:</i></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If your permit is expiring, you MUST bring your old permit to TAPS and exchange it for a new one. </span><strong>Your deductions will continue regardless of your permit expiration date. To stop deductions, you must return your permit to TAPS.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit the </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TAPS website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for detailed information about all of our programs, and remember to follow TAPS on </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc_taps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc_taps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TapsUCSC"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for updated information and announcements.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">It has been one year since our on-site research activities had to be ramped down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you all for maintaining a healthy and safe environment while continuing your research activities despite the very challenging conditions.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">As you are likely aware, we are finally beginning to make real headway against COVID-19: new infections are down locally, regionally, and nationally, increasing numbers of people are being vaccinated daily with more than 25% receiving at least one dose nationwide, and Santa Cruz County has recently moved down into the Red Tier and will be moving to Orange this week. These are promising trends. At this time, based in part on the outstanding compliance we have had to date we believe it is possible to further open up access to our research spaces.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">This expansion of research operations represents a portion of the next phase of our overall resumption of on-site campus operations. Additional guidance from campus leadership on plans for expansion of other aspects of our campus operations will be forthcoming.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The guidelines below must be followed rigorously. The high level of compliance to date gives us confidence that this is the right action to take at this time. As always, while we hope the positive trends will continue, these guidelines are subject to change if conditions change.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>These guidelines apply only to buildings that have been cleared for use</span><span>.</span><span> If you are not sure if yours has been cleared, please check with your Assistant Dean. (Assistant Deans, please coordinate with </span><a href="mailto:algullin@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>OES&#8212;Emergency Management</span></a><span> to schedule building assessments as needed to get buildings cleared for use.

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Single-occupancy offices may be used for research purposes in any building that has been cleared for use. Face coverings are not required while working alone inside the office with a closed door, but must be worn at all times while on university property outside of the office. If anyone else enters the office, it should be treated as a shared office (see below).</span></span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><strong><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Shared offices, labs, studios and other research spaces</span></strong></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Shared offices, labs, studios, and other shared research spaces may be used solo or concurrently by two or more people for research purposes in any building that has been cleared for use, subject to the following additional constraints:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Face coverings must be worn at all times, even when others are not present</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">When others are present, 6 feet separation must be maintained at all times except in passing</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Occupancy should be limited to no more than about 1 person per 100 sq. ft., depending on how the space is used, layout of the space, equipment and furnishings in the space, etc.</span></span></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Small impromptu meetings may be held in non-public shared spaces (i.e., labs and studios) as long as all safety requirements are strictly maintained</span></span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Building committees</strong><span> need no longer track the numbers of individuals working in each space, nor review lab utilization plans. However, we do ask that building committees share any special building-specific considerations with occupants.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">No further approvals are needed to ramp up to this new level of activity. As always, the campus may require a change in the status of the ramp up/down process with very short notice based on campus, community, and county public health assessments.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">For now, vaccination status cannot be used as a criterion for research facility access, staffing levels, or to change masking and physical distancing requirements.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these disciplines, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering&#8217;s graduate offerings were UCSC&#8217;s highest-performing programs, according to the survey criteria. Computer engineering specialties, in particular, ranked 51st. The overall engineering school ranked 88th for its graduate programs, while specialties related to electrical engineering and bioengineering ranked at 77th and 97th, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After engineering, the Economics Department had UCSC&#8217;s next-best rankings performance, coming in at 53rd, followed by history programs, at 63rd. Programs in sociology, education, and political science ranked 70th, 136th, and 89th. These rankings were based on peer assessment surveys sent to academics in each discipline. Non-specialty engineering rankings and education rankings also included other factors, like statistical data on student selectivity, faculty resources, and research activity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programs in the sciences were previously ranked in the 2019 edition of the &#8220;Best Grad Schools&#8221; guide.

(Photo by David Williams)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The UC Santa Cruz Seymour Marine Discovery Center&#8217;s long-awaited reopening is finally on the horizon. As COVID-19 cases continue to decline in Santa Cruz County, the Seymour Center is eagerly preparing to open <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/hours-admission/">Seymour Center Outdoors!</a>, a new in-person outdoor education program featuring a variety of interpretation stations run by the center&#8217;s knowledgeable docents. The stations will be located around the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/exhibits/outdoor-giants/">Pathway of Giants</a> and will allow visitors to learn about favorite attractions like the blue whale and gray whale skeletons. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The stations are scheduled to open to the general public on April 24. The center will then remain open every Saturday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. (weather permitting), until further notice.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Jo Lynne Jones, a Seymour Center board member who has been helping to ensure the safety of the stations, says the format will be slightly different from pre-COVID outdoor tours to accommodate safety standards, but will remain as educational and inspiring as the tours have been in the past. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I am looking forward to being able to have people walk through and gain knowledge from our wonderful volunteers,&#8221; Jones says. &#8220;That kind of contact with the public makes the center come alive and is the whole reason for it being there.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Seymour Center has also opened registration for an in-person <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/youth-teen-programs/ocean-explorers-summer-camp/">Ocean Explorers Summer Camp</a> for children. The program will run from June 7 to August 6 and allow campers to actively learn from field explorations, hands-on activities, games, and crafts.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Online programming continues</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As the Seymour Center prepares to at least partially reopen to in-person experiences, it will also continue offering some of the unique virtual programming that has allowed it to expand its reach during the pandemic. Online experiences like <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/science-sundays/">Science Sundays</a>, <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/labside-chats/">Labside Chats</a>, and <a href="https://youngerlagoonreserve.ucsc.edu/research-teaching-public-service/visit/virtual-tour.html">virtual tours</a> of Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve have provided opportunities for the center to bring the wonders of the California coast to people who might otherwise never get to experience it. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Seymour Center&#8217;s most recent offering, &#8220;Scientists Saving the Oceans,&#8221; was an in-depth class that allowed participants to observe researchers in action and learn from experts about marine mammals and their conservation. Jones participated in the program, and said that as eager as she is for live experiences to come back, there were also some undeniable advantages to a virtual program. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;When you are in person you are often jockeying for position to see what the guides are pointing out, but with the virtual experience, you are right there,&#8221; Jones explains. &#8220;It is very powerful.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Structural changes </span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>The online programming led by UC Santa Cruz scientists reflects the Seymour Center&#8217;s <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/seymour-center-visitor-experience.html">reimagining of the visitor experience</a> that began before the pandemic. Based on a comprehensive review, the center has been working on new exhibits and programming to better educate the public about the role university-based research plays in conserving the world&#8217;s oceans.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>UC Santa Cruz has made some structural changes to the Seymour Center that it hopes will help the center stay connected to university research. One of these changes has been to give the center a more prominent position by having it report directly to UCSC&#8217;s dean of physical and biological sciences. The university has also created a new position for a director of research initiatives for the Seymour Center and appointed Professor Terrie Williams to fill the role.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Seymour Center hopes that providing a closer connection university researchers will allow visitors to feel connected to the ocean and the ongoing conservation efforts that university research is helping to support.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;As research scientists, my colleagues and I at UCSC have spent our lives studying nature,&#8221; Williams says. &#8220;My goal as the new director of research initiatives is to create new experiences for the young and the old to see what we have seen, both in terms of nature&#8217;s beauty and its drastic changes.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>More exciting changes on the horizon </span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>One of the biggest changes to the Seymour Center in the past year was the retirement of its beloved founding director, Julie Barret Heffington, last June. The Seymour Center is currently searching for a new director to lead it into the next stage of its development.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As the center awaits its new director, the staff and an executive governing committee are resuming planning for <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/seymour-center-visitor-experience.html">facility and exhibit upgrades</a> that had to be put on pause when the pandemic began. They are currently consulting with museum experts on how to create a new, engaging visitor experience, and they believe that the updates will help further capture the imaginations of the next generation of scientists.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I'd like the public to know how excited we all are at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center to bring all of our friends and followers on new journeys,&#8221; Williams says. &#8220;We want visitors to be able to connect with nature in ways that they never have before. Get ready as we reopen&#8212;the expeditions begin soon!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="89f4a8fd80727017480ce7266cb6089a"><name>51-pegasi-fellowships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Postdoctoral fellowships support planetary science research</title><summary>Emily Martin and Melodie Kao have won 51 Pegasi b Fellowships to support their research on exoplanets.</summary><start-date>1617174000000</start-date><display-name>Postdoctoral fellowships support planetary science research</display-name><path>/2021/03/51-pegasi-fellowships</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/03/51-pegasi-fellowships</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1617222215903</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617222467333</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/emily-martin-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/emily-martin-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-martin-350.jpg</name><display-name>emily-martin-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72910</file-size><width>350</width><height>423</height></image><image-alt>Emily Martin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/melodie-kao-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/melodie-kao-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melodie-kao-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>melodie-kao-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19086</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Melodie Kao</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Emily Martin</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/melodie-kao-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/melodie-kao-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melodie-kao-350.jpg</name><display-name>melodie-kao-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>89747</file-size><width>350</width><height>423</height></image><image-alt>Melodie Kao</image-alt><image-caption>Melodie Kao</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Emily Martin and Melodie Kao have won 51 Pegasi b Fellowships to support their research on exoplanets</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Heising-Simons Foundation has awarded 51 Pegasi b Fellowships to Emily Martin and Melodie Kao to support their postdoctoral research in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz starting in fall 2021.</p>
<p>Established in 2017, the Heising-Simons Foundation 51 Pegasi b Fellowship is named for the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a sun-like star. The growing field of planetary astronomy studies objects both within and beyond our solar system, bridging planetary science and astronomy. From improving our understanding of planetary system formation and evolution, to advancing new technologies for detecting other worlds, 51 Pegasi b Fellows make a unique contribution to the field.</p>
<p>In her fellowship, Emily Martin will pioneer a method to directly compare solar system planets to exoplanets using a novel instrument she developed for Lick Observatory, called PEAS (The Planet as Exoplanet Analog Spectrograph). She said she looks forward to creating new technology that assists her peers in pursuing new scientific avenues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the cooperative spirit behind instrumentation, and that it enables all different kinds of science,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;It feels so impactful to contribute to multiple parts of the planetary science field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin spent six years contributing to the upgrade of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC), which operates out of the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. This workhorse instrument gathers broad-ranging data on astrophysical objects including comets, exoplanets, newly forming stars, and some of the most distant galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll always value my time spent collaborating with a team to upgrade NIRSPEC. It felt so gratifying to see it all come together after working so hard for so long,&#8221; Martin said. She earned her Ph.D. in astronomy at UCLA in 2018 and has since been pursuing postdoctoral research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Melodie Kao is developing new strategies to assess the engines that generate the magnetic processes and environments of planet-like objects, and to interpret exoplanet radio detections. As a graduate student, she used radio observations to show that powerful displays of aurora can occur on brown dwarfs&#8212;failed stars with magnetic behaviors akin to exoplanets.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first analyzed what became the telltale smudge of an aurora on a free-floating planetary mass object, there was a peculiar experience that became harder and harder to ignore&#8212;almost like the reality of what we found was oozing into my consciousness,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In her fellowship, Kao will further develop radio observations to illuminate the engines that generate magnetic processes in both brown dwarfs and exoplanets. In conjunction, she will investigate their aurorae, as well as the physics occurring in their magnetospheres (the region of space influenced by an object&#8217;s magnetic field). Understanding such magnetic behaviors will provide a key missing ingredient for fully characterizing exoplanetary systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I do science, it&#8217;s like tending to a garden,&#8221; Kao said. &#8220;You nurture the question that alighted in your brain until, one day, the data you&#8217;ve collected blooms and offers its secret to you. It always feels like a big responsibility to introduce this knowledge to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kao received a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology in 2017 and is currently a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. She will begin her 51 Pegasi b Fellowship appointment at UCSC in fall 2021.</p>
<p>The 51 Pegasi b Fellowship provides exceptional postdoctoral scientists with the opportunity to conduct theoretical, observational, and experimental research in planetary astronomy. The fellowship award provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to $375,000 of support for independent research over three years.</li>
<li>Time and space to establish distinction and leadership in the field.</li>
