<p>In a new study, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) molecule that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in immune system cells called macrophages and affects the susceptibility of mice to septic shock.</p>
<p>This lncRNA, called GAPLINC, was previously studied for its role in cancer, but it turns out to be the most highly expressed lncRNA in macrophages, which play a central role in inflammation. Susan Carpenter, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, said GAPLINC stood out when her lab performed RNA sequencing of human macrophages and their precursors, white blood cells called monocytes.</p>
<p>Subsequent experiments showed that reducing or eliminating GAPLINC led to enhanced expression of inflammatory genes in both mouse and human cells. Paradoxically, this effect protected mice from endotoxic shock and death in a mouse model of sepsis. The difference was dramatic, with all of the normal (&#8220;wildtype&#8221;) mice dying within a day, while all of the mice in which GAPLINC was knocked out survived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hypothesis was that the knockout mice would do worse in a model of endotoxic shock, so we were surprised to find that they did much better,&#8221; said Carpenter, the corresponding author of a paper on the new findings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016648118">published February 1 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Noncoding RNAs are RNA molecules that are transcribed from the genome but are not translated into a protein, and lncRNA is the largest class of noncoding RNA. In recent years, scientists have identified thousands of lncRNAs in mammalian genomes that regulate gene expression in different biological processes. GAPLINC is one of the few examples of a lncRNA found in both humans and mice.</p>
<p>Apple Vollmers, a graduate student in Carpenter&#8217;s lab and first author of the paper, said the team&#8217;s RNA sequencing results showed that GAPLINC is highly expressed during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought initially that it was involved in regulating differentiation, but when we depleted it, that turned on inflammatory genes,&#8221; Vollmers said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a low level of expression, so the genes are not turning on at the same level as when a macrophage is activated in response to a pathogen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Endotoxic shock</strong></p>
<p>The mouse model of sepsis involves exposing mice to a component of gram-negative bacteria called lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as endotoxin), which is known to trigger septic shock in bacterial infections. Carpenter said starting from a low baseline level of inflammatory gene expression may make the inflammatory response to LPS less of a shock to the system. &#8220;Instead of going from zero to 100, you might go from 10 to 100, and we think that provides some protection, but we&#8217;re not sure why,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Macrophages are among the first cells involved in the body&#8217;s response to any injury or infection. They are patrollers and first responders, circulating in the blood as monocytes and differentiating into macrophages that move to sites where they are needed to help fight infection or heal an injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;They help turn on inflammation, but they also play an important role in turning it off,&#8221; Carpenter said.</p>
<p>The expression of GAPLINC gets turned on when monocytes differentiate into macrophages, and it gets turned down after the cells are exposed to LPS. &#8220;Something interesting is happening between those steps, where somehow modulating the expression of GAPLINC can be protective,&#8221; Carpenter said.</p>
<p>In sepsis, the inflammatory response goes into overdrive as cells release a deluge of inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Cytokines are often produced in a cascade, as one cytokine stimulates its target cells to make additional cytokines. Uncontrolled cytokine production is often called a &#8220;cytokine storm.&#8221; This process also triggers clotting, and blood clots then block the flow of oxygen-carrying blood to critical organs, leading to organ failure and death.</p>
<p>Sepsis can also be triggered by viral infections and may be involved in severe cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest problem with sepsis is that it happens so fast, and once it gets going there are no good treatment options,&#8221; Carpenter said.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the role of GAPLINC in controlling the inflammatory response and septic shock could lead to new opportunities for drug development to target sepsis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a long way from understanding how you would target this therapeutically, but at least we have identified a pathway to home in on,&#8221; Carpenter said.</p>
<p>In addition to Carpenter and Vollmers, the coauthors of the paper include postdoctoral researcher Sergio Covarrubias; undergraduates Daisy Kuang, Aaron Shulkin, and Justin Iwuagwu; sequencing analyst Sol Katzman; assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Christopher Vollmers; and Ran Song and Edward Wakeland at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Apple Vollmers was supported by a Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gilliam Fellowship.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f60e800807270172c1b96bded703335"><name>rhiana-gunn-wright</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Green New Deal architect Rhiana Gunn-Wright will make a virtual campus visit</title><summary>Gunn-Wright previewed some of the insights she'll share on climate policy and environmental justice during her February 10th event with the Institute for Social Transformation.</summary><start-date>1612166400000</start-date><display-name>Rhiana Gunn-Wright Event Preview</display-name><path>/2021/02/rhiana-gunn-wright</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/rhiana-gunn-wright</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1612212922335</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612374502652</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>black-history</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/rhiana-gunn-wright-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/rhiana-gunn-wright-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rhiana-gunn-wright-350.jpg</name><display-name>rhiana-gunn-wright-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>77555</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Rhiana Gunn-Wright posing indoors</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/rhiana-gunn-wright-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/rhiana-gunn-wright-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rhiana-gunn-wright-80.jpg</name><display-name>rhiana-gunn-wright-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24646</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rhiana Gunn-Wright posing indoors</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rhiana Gunn-Wright previewed some of the insights she'll share during her February 10th event.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>She’ll share climate policy and environmental justice insights during a public virtual event hosted by the Institute for Social Transformation
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change. Racism. Disparities in health and livelihoods. The biggest challenges of our modern era are not as separate as they might seem. Rhiana Gunn-Wright wants to help others see how environmental degradation and social injustices are deeply intertwined. Because understanding these connections is a powerful starting place for meaningful change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunn-Wright, lead developer of the Green New Deal and current climate policy director at the Roosevelt Institute, will share her insights at a </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/event/climate-justice-conversation-with-rhiana-gunn-wright/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free public virtual event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation, coming up on Wednesday, February 10th, from 5:30&#8211;7 p.m. She&#8217;ll also meet privately, earlier in the day, with a group of graduate students and students from the People of Color Sustainability Collective to provide mentorship and discuss shared research interests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunn-Wright hopes audience members at her evening event will come prepared to think about climate change and social justice issues in new ways that could offer shared solutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ways that we've been thinking about climate change up until now&#8212;focusing on the technical aspects like temperature changes, parts-per-million in the atmosphere, and ice caps&#8212;have gotten us some wins, but they haven't gotten us as far as we need to go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In a time when there are so many issues competing for attention, this talk might be a way to help knit together many of those things for folks so they can see how to be effective.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Gunn-Wright will discuss the importance of integrating climate policy into a post-COVID economic recovery, and she&#8217;ll detail opportunities for the Biden administration to tackle climate change in a way that centers environmental justice for frontline communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Envisioning a path forward</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities of color are disproportionately affected by health impacts, like asthma, from the burning of fossil fuels, and they&#8217;re also most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including extreme heat and flooding. These trends are the legacies of discriminatory policies, and Gunn-Wright says climate policy must seek to right these wrongs.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People have given up their bodies and their lives, often unwillingly, for us to be able to prosper off of fossil fuels,&#8221; Gunn-Wright explained. &#8220;And now, they need resources to weather what's coming.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunn-Wright says climate policy also needs to transition society away from the use of fossil fuels rapidly enough to keep global warming below the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, beyond which the risk of catastrophic impacts increases greatly. It&#8217;s a monumental task that she describes as, &#8220;changing our source of energy from one that is poisoning us to one that is not.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those goals in mind, several years ago, she developed a national climate action plan called the Green New Deal. That plan was then introduced as a congressional resolution in early 2019, and since that time, it has stimulated global discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an architect of the Green New Deal, Rhiana has presented one of the most important policy initiatives to address, arguably, the most crucial issues in the world right now,&#8221; said Chris Benner, director of the Institute for Social Transformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner said he&#8217;s very excited that faculty, students, and community members will have a chance to learn from such a world-renowned leader.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Building a movement</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunn-Wright plans to share advocacy and organizing tips to help others become climate leaders, too. She says federal climate policy often takes direction from successful initiatives at the state and local level, so getting involved with local climate-related issues is a great way to start. And, ultimately, the most meaningful types of climate action come from joining together with others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Figure out who your people are, and then move alongside them,&#8221; Gunn-Wright said. &#8220;Because one thing we've seen is that individual action isn't enough. It's great to do as much as you can as an individual to reduce your waste, to vote for climate policy, and to do other things in your individual sphere, but we're at a time when we need power. And power, particularly in the U.S., comes from numbers and pressure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more of Gunn-Wright&#8217;s tips and insights, interested members of the public should be sure to </span><a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_o7ezK23iR3q0E80jgIrhvg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the upcoming event. Valentin Lopez, chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, will provide opening remarks, then Gunn-Wright will dive into conversation with the event&#8217;s moderator, Associate Professor of Environmental Studies Sikina Jinnah. Jinnah encourages both climate experts and newcomers to the issue to participate in this event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The type of work that Rhiana is doing to reframe climate politics along a justice lens is really the future of politics,&#8221; Jinnah said. &#8220;To have the opportunity to engage with someone who has been so incredibly effective at what she is fighting for is an inspiration for all of us.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f800d40807270172c1b96bd8899ef29"><name>sanders-john-alumni-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alum inspires kids to create a personal relationship with nature</title><summary>John Sanders's fascination with the ocean began when he moved with his parents to Venice, Calif.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>John Sanders was on a UC Santa Cruz research vessel in the Monterey Bay trying to capture the attention of a group of summer-school kids when a pod of about 16 orcas chased and then attacked a grey whale and her calf.&#160;</p>
<p>The students, mostly middle-schoolers from the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District who were part of a summer science program at UC Santa Cruz, watched open-mouthed. Afterward, they pestered Sanders with so many questions about orcas, whales, and marine life that he took them to a library so they could do research for themselves.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an eye-opener for me on how students integrated information,&#8221; said Sanders, who now heads his own hands-on, science education program, the Delphinus School of Natural History, in San Luis Obispo. Aimed at kids from age 7 to 12, the three- and five-day camps Sanders offers are aimed at turning screen-fixated kids into mini&#8211;field scientists.&#160;</p>
<p>Last year, he shepherded some 100 children through his program.</p>
<p>Sanders&#8217;s first taste of the natural world came from his maternal grandparents&#8217; 40-acre farm in Laurel, Miss. Because the area was still segregated, Sanders said, there were few stores where the family could shop, so they hunted, fished, and raised beans, potatoes, corn, peanuts, and hogs. The farm was where he learned to recognize the natural cycles of plants and animals.</p>
<p>It was when his parents moved to Venice, Calif., however that Sanders&#8217;s fascination with the ocean began. He said he would spend hours roaming the beaches and exploring wetlands. He came to love the quiet of an estuary and the natural silence of the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. He would examine the colors in a single rock, sniff plants to capture their smell, and observe seabirds, and he learned to identify animal footprints. His only restriction was that he had to be home before the streetlights came on.</p>
<p>After graduating with a biology degree from UC Santa Cruz, Sanders joined the campus&#8217;s graduate program and was one of the first preceptors at what was then College Eight. In 2002, he got a job as a naturalist as part of Camp KEEP (Kern Environmental Education Program), an outdoor science school for fifth- and sixth-graders in Kern County affiliated with the county&#8217;s Office of Superintendent of Schools. He founded Delphinus in 2011.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>His camps are built on the idea of exploration and observation, according to Sanders. Instead of lectures, students do water-quality testing around Morro Bay or stroll through chaparral at Monta&#241;a de Oro State Park. They hike in Pinnacles National Park, where the 400 species of native bees there open a conversation about the concept of resource allocation, Sanders said. He&#8217;ll also take students to a spot near Fairfield where they can explore the San Andreas Fault, or on a trip to examine Morro Rock as an illustration of how plate tectonics moved it from its origin near Los Angeles, 180 miles away. His goal is to show his students how to observe and then let the questions flow into a discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so much about their environment that these kids don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Sanders said. &#8220;Because they are learning in an environment where they can play as well as explore, they come to enjoy being outdoors.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The Delphinus School is funded primarily through enrollment fees, which range from $100 to $500 per session, although when Sanders first started, he financed the school with his own money.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;What inspires me is that I&#8217;m helping to develop a whole generation of environmental stewards who aren&#8217;t just casual observers of nature,&#8221; Sanders said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/sanders-john-feat.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/sanders-john-feat.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sanders-john-feat.jpg</name><file-size>24309</file-size><width>400</width><height>190</height></thumb><thumb-alt>John Sanders</thumb-alt><title>John Sanders: Natural Leader</title><description>John Sanders (Rachel Carson ’89, biology) aims to help develop a generation of environmental stewards.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f8b8840807270172c1b96bd87da3914"><name>mlk-2021-convocation-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reform, abolition, and vision</title><summary>Organizer and prison industrial complex abolitionist Mariame Kaba to address Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation, which will be held virtually for the first time&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 forced the cancellation of many parades and marches marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the pandemic will not put a damper on </span><a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/mlk#:&#126;:text=37th%20Annual%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr%20Memorial%20Convocation&amp;text=February%2012%2C%202021%20at%205,p.m.%20to%207%3A00%20p.m."><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 37th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will pivot to an unprecedented all-virtual format when it takes place on Friday, February 12, from 5:30 to 7 p.m.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually the event is held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, which was packed to the rafters and with lines around the block for such speakers as activist, author, and distinguished UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita Angela Davis and Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation Planning Committee, made up of students, professional staff, and faculty,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expect a robust online crowd to hear keynote speaker </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariame Kaba, an organizer, educator, curator, and prison industrial complex abolitionist who is active in movements for racial, gender, and transformative justice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are fortunate to learn more about Mariame Kaba&#8217;s work on racial and gender justice and abolition, which is instrumental in dismantling the prison-industrial complex, structural racism, and anti-blackness,&#8221; said Associate Vice Chancellor/Chief Diversity Officer Teresa Maria Linda Scholz.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will provide transformative guidance to members of the UCSC community and beyond who are committed to community organizing and abolition work.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

They are among 31 members honored as 2021 AAS Fellows for extraordinary achievement and service.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta was recognized &#8220;for seminal contributions to studies of galaxy formation and evolution and stellar populations as well as a lifetime of dedicated service to the training of young scientists.&#8221; His research on the formation and evolution of galaxies includes studying the &#8220;fossil record&#8221; of local galaxies such as Andromeda, our large galactic neighbor, and he led the SPLASH collaboration, a large survey of red giant stars in Andromeda.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta has also been active for many years in efforts to increase access to STEM research opportunities for high school students. He founded the <a href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/">Science Internship Program</a> (SIP) at UCSC, and he is a cofounder of the Global SPHERE Network, which promotes programs like SIP that provide research experience for high school students.</p>
<p>Illingworth was recognized &#8220;for path-breaking studies of infant galaxies at the dawn of the universe, lifelong service to the astronomical community, and astute guidance on the national and international scene.&#8221; His research publications on the most distant and earliest galaxies, with an international team of scientists, have consistently been among the most highly cited papers on galaxies in the early universe.</p>
<p>Illingworth has also played leading roles in the development of major telescopes and astronomical instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as the ground-based Keck Telescopes and Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT). He served as deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in the 1980s, and he has served on numerous advisory teams and chaired several major astronomy and astrophysics policy committees. He received the AAS Lancelot M. Berkeley New York Community Trust Prize in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful to be able to recognize the scientific accomplishments and service to astronomy of a small group of our outstanding members each year,&#8221; said AAS President Paula Szkody.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn&#8217;t until she did a summer research internship at Rice University&#8217;s Earth sciences department that she found her passion. She thought it was amazing that you could use the chemical signatures of rocks to find out how they came to be.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I found it fascinating that rocks, the land beneath your feet, mountains, valleys&#8212;things we often take for granted&#8212;can tell us about Earth&#8217;s history,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They hold a record of what occurred a long time ago&#8212;billions and billions of years ago.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that this kind of work fit her very well. &#8220;It was detective work but also laboratory analysis, which I had grown to really enjoy,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her skill in the field led her to win funding last year from NASA through the </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-six-early-career-planetary-scientists-to-continue-exceptional-research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planetary Science Early Career Award program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She will use the money to assist in her research in cosmochemistry, the chemical analysis of meteorites. She is one of six scientists to get the grants, which are awards of up to $200,000 each.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The child of immigrants from Haiti, she grew up in the Little Haiti area of Miami. Her father still works there as a foreman in a cemetery. Her mother is a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home. Telus is the first person in her family to get a bachelor&#8217;s degree, a doctorate, or be a professor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third of six children, Telus was never pushed by her parents to succeed in science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Basically, they just wanted me to finish college,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They never pressured me to do anything in particular. I felt the freedom to try different things.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telus started off in environmental studies, but found that it was mostly centered on public policy, which didn&#8217;t fit her interests. She gravitated to Earth sciences because it involved using physics, chemistry, and math to understand how the Earth formed and changed through time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, she moved past the Earth to focus on studying meteorites&#8212;rocks from outer space.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just fell in love with the idea that we have rocks that formed a long time ago when the solar system was forming and when planets were baby planets,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They record a period of time that we no longer have access to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she began her studies at college, she was so excited about what she was learning that she didn&#8217;t pay much attention to the fact that she was the only Black person in her geology classes. As she neared finishing her doctorate and started to consider finding a job, she became a bit nervous.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see people like me in these positions,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she found a lot of support every step along the way and was encouraged by connections she made with Black scientists at conferences. She sought out mentors who could give her the guidance she needed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you know you have certain disadvantages, it helps to have people who will help you and be your cheerleaders,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She appreciates growing up in an area with a lot of Black people where Black History Month was celebrated every year. She remembers singing songs and learning about famous civil rights leaders and other famous Black people in elementary school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she has her own kids, she wants to pass on that knowledge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of people died for a simple right to live and be an individual, and I think that should be celebrated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Their strength, courage, and sacrifice should be remembered. It doesn&#8217;t just benefit Black people. Every oppressed person in the world benefits from the civil rights movement and all of the things Black people have had to overcome.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/telus-myriam-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/telus-myriam-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>telus-myriam-featured.jpg</name><display-name>telus-myriam-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>34985</file-size><width>400</width><height>190</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Myriam Telus</thumb-alt><title>Meteoric Success: Myriam Telus</title><description>Planetary scientist Myriam Telus, a NASA early-career award winner, reflects on her journey to UC Santa Cruz to study meteorites: Discovering her passion, seeking out mentors, and finding inspiration in the courage of civil rights movement leaders.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="650b3444807270172c1b96bdc4b8a7e5"><name>public-works-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seawater intake replacement, bike path improvement projects win public works awards</title><summary>A $1.1 million project to replace the seawater intake structure at the UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab was selected as environmental project of the year by the Monterey Bay chapter of the American Public Works Association. </summary><start-date>1612308600000</start-date><display-name>public-works-awards</display-name><path>/2021/02/public-works-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/public-works-awards</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1612307969066</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612322202466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Construction</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/aerial-view-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/aerial-view-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aerial-view-500.jpg</name><display-name>aerial-view-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>119233</file-size><width>500</width><height>563</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/diver-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/diver-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diver-80.jpg</name><display-name>diver-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8982</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>aerial view of long marine lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>In this aerial view of UCSC's Long Marine Lab, the seawater intake is in a tiny pocket beach at the base of the point.

(Photo by Long Marine Lab)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>A $1.1 million project to replace the seawater intake structure at the UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab was selected as environmental project of the year by the Monterey Bay chapter of the American Public Works Association. <br/><br/>The project entailed divers who could only work during minus tides at the base of a 30-foot coastal cliff and concrete that had to set in cold ocean water within four hours but not seize while being pumped. <br/><br/>It was supposed to be completed over three months in fall 2019 but high surf over several weeks brought work to an end in December after only 10 days of actual work. <br/><br/>A revised schedule for last summer was impacted by COVID-19, and an unprecedented lightning storm followed by the CZU Lightning Complex Fire. Work finally ended last September. Despite the natural impediments, the seawater intake system continued to deliver up to 1,000 gallons a minute to labs on the marine terrace operated by UCSC and state and federal agencies. <br/><br/>Another UC Santa Cruz project, the Great Meadow Bike Path, phase 2, was selected for an award of merit as a transportation project of less than $5 million. It, too, was hampered by COVID-19 and wildfire, particularly smoke. Both awards were announced at a virtual ceremony Jan. 27 by the Monterey Bay APWA chapter. <br/><br/>The original 44-year-old mile-long bike path was upgraded to current Caltrans standards. The new path follows the same route but with wider bike lanes and shoulders, improved signage, and safer road crossings. The uphill portion can also accommodate pedestrians since it is wider.<br/><br/>The seawater intake structure is located in a small pocket beach below the marine terrace and suffered significant damage from corrosion and heavy wave action. Despite temporary repairs, an inspection in 2018 revealed that the system was well beyond its effective useful life. Its failure would mean significant loss of life to marine animals that depend on fresh, filtered seawater at UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Campus. <br/> <br/>Nine separate federal, state and local regulatory agencies were involved in the permitting process and a biologist was on the project site at all times during construction. A seawater repair project of that sort had never been done before, said the project manager Phil Boutelle from UCSC&#8217;s Physical Planning Development and Operations office.<br/><br/>&#8220;Completing a repair in the state marine protected area under the federal marine sanctuary hadn&#8217;t been done before, so everyone involved got creative to make it happen, including regulators and contractors,&#8221; Boutelle said of the effort. He credited campus planning staff for making sure the project was able to be built. &#8220;The PPDO planning team was nimble and responsive. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without their support.&#8221; <br/><br/>Divers were lowered in a cage by a crane positioned on the bluff above which sped the process of accessing the work site and helped prevent impact on mussels on the reef. <br/><br/>During the first five weeks of construction, the dive team lost more than half of its planned work days because of high surf, which made working conditions unsafe and the site inaccessible. <br/><br/>Work was delayed until summer 2020 when surf conditions were expected to be flatter but high swells frequently delayed construction. Work often took place at night to coincide with minus tides. The dive crew was in the water in the early morning hours of Aug. 16 when the dry lightning storm hit. They soon got out. The lightning not only stopped work but ignited dozens of fires that further delayed progress because of smoke, campus closures and travel bans.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65f5e42d807270172c1b96bde4322b82"><name>robert-stevens-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Robert Bocking Stevens, fifth UCSC chancellor, dies at age 87</title><summary>Robert Bocking Stevens, a legal scholar in England and the United States who served as the fifth chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, died Jan. 30 in Oxford, England, at age 87.&#13;

He later became Master of Pembroke College, Oxford University, until he retired in 2001.<br/><br/>At UC Santa Cruz, Stevens worked to increase student body diversity and accommodate growing demand for attendance while also working to repair town-gown relations over issues of university impact on traffic and housing. Stevens was in office when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake struck and memorably allocated UC resources to aid recovery efforts in the city of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Stevens re-initiated planning for an engineering school by commissioning a faculty committee to study the idea. In 1991, Stevens submitted a proposal to the UC Office of the President, and a gift from the late Jack Baskin&#160;ultimately helped launch UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in 1997.<br/><br/>In an interview with the <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/stevens">Regional Oral History Project</a> shortly before he left Santa Cruz, Stevens said he was proud of his efforts to strengthen recruitment from underrepresented communities. &#8220;The fall I arrived 23 percent of our students were students of color. Next fall, (1991) 45 percent of our freshmen students will be students of color,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So there&#8217;s been a very dramatic change.&#8221;<br/><br/>He said he spent his first two years on campus purposefully working closely with the city to improve the town-gown relationship.<br/><br/>After the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake hit, ultimately causing about $7 million in damage on campus, Stevens directed UC resources to the city and county of Santa Cruz. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t need extra police and UCLA sent them so we lent police to the city. UCLA sent emergency medical teams whom we lent to the county,&#8221; Stevens said. &#8220;My goal was not to make any demands on the city at all. So we didn&#8217;t use their fire services, we didn't use their police.&#8221; <br/><br/>Stevens was born June 8, 1933, in Leicester. He was educated at Oxford University and at Yale University, where he earned a masters of law. He first came to the United States at age 23 to take a fellowship at Northwestern University Law School. <br/><br/>Stevens later returned to England to become a law tutor at Keble College and launch a practice as a barrister. In 1960 Yale Law School offered him a position as an assistant professor, and he returned to the U.S. He became a U.S. citizen in 1971. <br/><br/>During much of his 16-year tenure at Yale, Stevens served as a legal adviser to the Commission on East African Cooperation in Nairobi, and later advised a successor organization, helping to negotiate agreements between Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and their neighbors. He taught his first course in legal history at Yale and the subject became the focus of his research.<br/><br/>Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, from 1978 until 1987, he served as <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/college-communications/news/robert-bocking-stevens-1933-2021">president of Haverford College</a>. Earlier, from 1976 to 1978, he was provost and professor of law and history at Tulane University. He also taught at Oxford University, the London School of Economics, Stanford University, and the University of East Africa.<br/><br/>In his interview with Randall Jarrell of the Regional Oral History Project, which he described as a &#8220;debriefing&#8221; after he announced his resignation, Stevens was very frank in admitting that he knew little about UC Santa Cruz before he was appointed chancellor. At the time he was also in the running for the top jobs at Case Western University, the University of Essex, and Dartmouth College.<br/><br/>He described a secretive interview process during which he first visited the campus and was told to say, if asked, that he was the brother of the person leading the tour. He said he took the job because he was impressed by the campus and its small college structure, and he and his wife liked Northern California. <br/><br/>Stevens accepted the job in the spring of 1987, succeeding Robert Sinsheimer. He was followed by Karl Pister. <br/><br/>Stevens wrote more than half a dozen books, including <em>In Search of Justice</em> (1968), <em>Welfare Medicine in America</em> (1974), <em>Law Schools: Legal Education in America: 1850-1960</em>, (1983) and <em>The English Judges</em> (2002).<br/><br/>He is survived by his wife, Kathie, three children &#8212; two from an earlier marriage &#8212; and two grandchildren. His youngest, Robin, was born in Santa Cruz when Stevens was chancellor and is now an author of fiction for children.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/stevens</url><title>Chancellor Stevens' oral interview with the Regional History Project</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.haverford.edu/college-communications/news/robert-bocking-stevens-1933-2021</url><title>Haverford College obituary</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="697a9159807270172c1b96bd4cd6e59f"><name>sad-news-regarding-former-chancellor-robert-stevens</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sad news regarding former Chancellor Robert Stevens</title><summary>It is with a heavy heart that I share the news of the passing of former UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert B.

He died at his home in Oxford, England, on Jan. 30, at the age of 87.<br/><br/>Chancellor Stevens took great pride in the increased access for students from all backgrounds during his four years at UCSC. From 1987 to 1991, the number of students of color on our campus rose about 20 percent. Joining a university whose mission is to serve students from diverse ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds is what sold him on becoming a UC chancellor. He also worked hard to foster positive relations between our campus and city leaders. In the days following the earthquake, he collaborated with city leaders to work together to recover as one community.&#160;<br/><br/>I did not know Chancellor Stevens personally, but he reached out after my arrival to campus to offer his best wishes, and again this summer when the wildfire was nearing campus. I appreciated his kindness and support in both instances.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Please join me in taking a moment to recognize Chancellor Stevens&#8217; contributions to campus, which are detailed in a&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/robert-stevens-in-memoriam.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">story on our campus newscenter</a>.

<p><span>The IDA received 1056 submissions for the 2020 awards, which included 365 documentary features,153 documentary shorts,153 documentary series, 52 student films, 39 music documentaries, and 33 audio documentaries or podcasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The nominees were selected by independent committees of 190 documentary makers, curators, critics, and industry experts from 25 countries. The aim of the IDA is to honor excellence in the documentary field worldwide by both emerging and established filmmakers.</span></p>
<p><span>Alumna <strong><i>Melanie Dang Ho</i></strong>&#160;(Social Documentation, 2020) was nominated in the <i>Best Short</i> category for her M.F.A. thesis film,<strong>&#160;</strong><i>s&#7889;ng &#7903; &#273;&#226;y (to live here), </i>which focuses on the lives of Vietnamese shrimpers and elderly farmers in New Orleans, exploring the relationship between land and labor.</span></p>
<p><span>A Vietnamese American filmmaker from Florida, she is working towards a career in documentary film editing, amplifying the voices of those on the margins. She is also one of six young filmmakers recently selected by the Center for Asian American Media for its inaugural Sauce Fellowship--a nine-month program offering resources, networking opportunities, workshops, mentorship, and connection to the distribution platforms of public media. </span></p>
<p><span>The fellowship is designed not only to provide a platform for Asian American stories to be lifted from a personal perspective, but also to expand the pipeline of diverse creators in public media.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Orion Rose Kelly</strong> (Film and Digital Media, 2017),&#160;and <strong>Marrok Sedgwick</strong> (Social Documentation, 2019) were both nominated for the <i>David L. Wolper Student Documentary Award</i>. It recognizes exceptional achievement in non-fiction film and video production at the university level, and is intended to bring greater public and industry awareness to the work of students in the documentary field.</span></p>
<p><span>Kelly was nominated for her film <i>Na Luta Delas</i>, about the growing violence against trans and queer women of color in Rio de Janeiro. Based in the Bay Area, she is a filmmaker, photographer, and video/photo editor who specializes in projects that involve violence and/or trauma, with a focus on human rights, criminal justice, sexual violence, and LGBTQ+ communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Kelly&#8217;s photos and video installations have been exhibited at The J. Paul Getty Museum, Lighthouse LA, Soapbox Gallery, UCSC&#8217;s Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, and Urban Decay in London.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Sedgwick went on to win the 2020 <i>David L. Wolper Student Documentary Award</i> category for his M.F.A. thesis film,&#160;<i>People Like Me, </i>which challenges dominant perspectives about non-speaking autistic people. The film is about autism acceptance, featuring interviews with non-speaking autistic adults about their visions for the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A disabled trans activist and educator who uses art as a primary tool for challenging society&#8217;s injustices, Sedgwick works as a creative producer and documentarian with a focus on the stories of those most underrepresented in the media today.</span></p>

Marine mammals chirp and squeal as they swim along. The pounding of surf along a distant shoreline heaves and thumps with metronomic regularity. These are the sounds that most of us associate with the marine environment. But this soundtrack of a healthy ocean no longer reflects the acoustic environment of today&#8217;s ocean, plagued with human-created noise.</p>
<p>A global team of researchers set out to understand how man-made noise affects wildlife in the oceans, from invertebrates to whales, and found overwhelming evidence that marine fauna and their ecosystems are negatively impacted by noise, which disrupts their behavior, physiology, and reproduction, and can even cause mortality. The scientists call for human-induced noise to be considered a prevalent stressor at the global scale and for policy to be developed to mitigate its effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there is a lot of concern now about anthropogenic effects on the global environment, most of the attention has been focused on climate change and ocean acidification. We wanted to get people to recognize that noise needs to be part of that discussion,&#8221; said Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Costa was part of a small group of marine scientists who came together in 2019 to discuss ocean noise at a meeting organized by Carlos M. Duarte, distinguished professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. After the initial discussions, they recruited a broader group of scientists, all leaders in their fields, and conducted a thorough review of the issue.</p>
<p>Their findings, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eaba4658">published February 4 in <em>Science</em></a>, are eye-opening as to the global prevalence and intensity of the impacts of ocean noise. Since the industrial revolution, humans have made the planet, and the oceans in particular, noisier through fishing, shipping, infrastructure development, and more, while also silencing the sounds from marine animals that once dominated the pristine ocean.</p>
<p>The deterioration of habitats such as coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and kelp beds due to climate change and other human pressures has further silenced their characteristic sounds&#8212;the soundtrack of a healthy ocean&#8212;which guide the larvae of fish and other animals drifting at sea into finding and settling on their habitats. The call home is no longer audible for many ecosystems and regions.</p>
<p>The Anthropocene marine environment, according to the researchers, is polluted by man-made acoustic phenomena, and should therefore be restored along sonic dimensions, as well as along more traditional chemical and climatic ones. Yet, current frameworks to improve ocean health ignore the need to mitigate noise as a pre-requisite for a healthy ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is there actually is a way forward, and many of the solutions are coincident with carbon reduction, such as electric engines for ships,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;We have tools to deal with sound, and unlike many other pollutants it is not persistent. Once you turn off the source, it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Costa, who has been studying underwater noise for several decades, noted that other researchers at UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences are also studying the effects of ocean noise on marine mammals, including Colleen Reichmuth, Ari Friedlaender, and Terrie Williams.</p>
<p>The new study points to the rapid response of marine animals to the human lockdown under COVID-19 as evidence of the potential for rapid recovery from noise pollution.</p>
<p>Sound travels far, and quickly, underwater. And marine animals are sensitive to sound, which they use as a prominent sensorial signal guiding all aspects of their behavior and ecology. &#8220;This makes the ocean soundscape one of the most important, and perhaps under-appreciated, aspects of the marine environment,&#8221; the study states. The authors hope the evidence presented in the paper will &#8220;prompt management actions...to reduce noise levels in the ocean, thereby allowing marine animals to re-establish their use of ocean sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team set out to document the impact of noise on marine animals and on marine ecosystems around the world. They assessed the evidence contained across more than 10,000 papers to consolidate compelling evidence that man-made noise impacts marine life from invertebrates to whales across multiple levels, from behavior to physiology.</p>
<p>&#8220;This unprecedented effort, involving a major tour-de-force, has shown the overwhelming evidence for the prevalence of impacts from human-induced noise on marine animals, to the point that the urgency of taking action can no longer be ignored,&#8221; said coauthor Michelle Havlik, a doctoral student at KAUST.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deep, dark ocean is conceived as a distant, remote ecosystem, even by marine scientists,&#8221; Duarte said. &#8220;However, as I was listening, years ago, to a hydrophone recording acquired off the U.S. West Coast, I was surprised to hear the clear sound of rain falling on the surface as the dominant sound in the deep-sea ocean environment. I then realized how acoustically-connected the ocean surface, where most human noise is generated, is to the deep sea; just 1,000 meters, less than 1 second apart!&#8221;</p>
<p>The takeaway of the review is that &#8220;mitigating the impacts of noise from human activities on marine life is key to achieving a healthier ocean.&#8221; The study identifies a number of actions that may come at a cost but are relatively easy to implement to improve the ocean soundscape and, in doing so, enable the recovery of marine life and the goal of a sustainable use of the ocean.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Nydia Vel&#225;zquez opened the proceedings by acknowledging that the coronavirus pandemic has &#8220;sparked a once-in-a-lifetime crisis for American small businesses,&#8221; and that, &#8220;as we start the new year, it is not clear that conditions have improved.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress is currently considering next steps for facilitating an equitable recovery process, so Fairlie was called upon to share his latest research on the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, including the disproportionate hardships faced by minority-owned businesses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Fairlie&#8217;s most widely-cited research has shown that minority-owned businesses are affected by pandemic-related closures at higher rates. From February to April, the number of active African-American-owned businesses dropped 41 percent, Latinx business ownership fell by 32 percent, and Asian business ownership dropped by 26 percent, compared to a 17 percent decline for white business owners. The overall number of American business owners during this period plummeted by 3.3 million, or 22 percent.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No other two-month, or even 12-month, window of time has ever shown such a large change in business activity,&#8221; Fairlie told the committee. &#8220;For comparison, from the start to the end of the Great Recession, the number of active business owners dropped by only five percent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>New data shows progress and setbacks</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the spring, Fairlie&#8217;s most recent data have shown that active business ownership rates among many minority groups were on a recovery trend, despite slower rates of recovery for Asian Americans and immigrant-owned businesses. But this trend peaked in October, then reversed course when new rounds of lockdowns in November and December brought a backwards slide toward increased small business closures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From October to December, overall small business activity dropped by six percent, with minority business owners once again experiencing larger drops of up to 10 percent. Fairlie is particularly concerned about the effects of these losses among the two most vulnerable sets of business owners, African American and Latinx people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Prior to the pandemic, business ownership and revenues were already low for both groups,&#8221; Fairlie said. &#8220;But perhaps more importantly, there is a huge wealth gap.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie explained that half of all Black families in the U.S. have less than $10,000 in total wealth, and half of Latinx families have less than $25,000 in total wealth. White levels of wealth are seven to 18 times higher. Minority-owned businesses also tend to be concentrated within the economic sectors most affected by the pandemic, like the service industry, and they generally operate at a smaller scale, which leaves them more vulnerable to economic shocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many minority business owners will simply not have the financial resources to weather prolonged closures,&#8221; Fairlie said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also presented new data on California sales losses for the second quarter of 2020, which showed average losses of 17 percent, but with stark disparities across industries. Hotels, for example, had lost 91 percent of their taxable sales, while restaurants lost 61 percent, and clothing stores lost 56 percent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, industries like brick-and-mortar retail are losing market share to online commerce, as customers seek to minimize their contact with others. Fairlie fears these trends may linger even after the pandemic subsides.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re just more used to buying things online,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re used to that convenience of having UPS deliver a package to our house. And very likely, that package is not from a small business. That package is from a big-box store or an online retailer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Solutions for supporting small businesses</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie recommends that relief efforts could support small businesses in building their online presences, perhaps through aid with website development. Search engines could also help by prioritizing local businesses in search results over online and big-box retailers. And the committee&#8217;s Vice Ranking Member, Representative Roger Williams, of Texas, noted that e-commerce support efforts could include expanding internet access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unfortunately, there are so many rural areas across the country, including my district, that do not have access to high-speed internet,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;This is setting these small businesses up for failure, simply because they do not have access to the necessary infrastructure to succeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie also shared his thoughts on the importance of financial assistance for businesses. In particular, he recommended rent relief measures for businesses that are struggling to make ends meet. And he explained findings from his review of 15 million pandemic relief loans, which showed mixed results for these programs among minority communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the first round of loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), minority business owners faced barriers in accessing funding, partly due to the types of financial institutions through which it was distributed. Changes to distribution methods then improved the flow of funding for the second round, but PPP loan amounts per employee still tend to be lower for minority-owned businesses. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, meanwhile, reached minority communities effectively with both the amount and number of loans provided.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure future relief efforts are equitable, Fairlie says the federal government must collect more data on race as part of their relief programs. And, ultimately, the most important thing governments can do to support small business health will be to ensure rapid vaccine distribution, so that customers can regain confidence in patronizing their favorite small businesses once more. Chairwoman Nydia Vel&#225;zquez expressed similar sentiments in her closing statements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As we continue to vaccinate more Americans, we move closer to the end of this crisis, but we are not there yet,&#8221; Vel&#225;zquez said. &#8220;Until that happens, small businesses will continue to struggle to return to pre-pandemic performance, and they will need our support.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="74506691807270172c1b96bde8bc173a"><name>student-affairs-success-podcast</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Affairs and Success launches new podcast</title><summary>After nearly a full year of operating remotely due to the impacts of Covid-19, it's easy to feel disconnected from our campus culture, as well as from each other.</summary><start-date>1612512000000</start-date><display-name>Student Affairs and Success launches new podcast</display-name><path>/2021/02/student-affairs-success-podcast</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/student-affairs-success-podcast</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1612564162170</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612831615739</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="gmail-p3">After nearly a full year of operating remotely due to the impacts of Covid-19, it's easy to feel disconnected from our campus culture, as well as from each other.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Don Williams, founder and artistic director of AATAT, he was a skinny little kid in Michigan when he decided to try out for a middle school football team. Most of the boys were bigger and older than Williams, he said, but he practiced hard, and when it came time to find out if he&#8217;d made the squad&#8212;the coach said if a player opened his locker on a certain day and found equipment, he was in&#8212;Williams fully expected to be on the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the appointed day, he flung open his locker. It was empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of giving up, however, Williams tugged on a mismatched pair of old thigh pads and half-broken shoulder pads he found in a corner, pulled on a jersey, and slipped onto the field. He tried to hide behind some of the bigger guys, he said, but the coach spotted him and ordered him to take off his jersey.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So when he sees the crazy stuff I had on, a tear comes to his eye and he says, &#8216;This boy wants to play football,&#8217;&#8221; Williams remembered. &#8220;That was a turning point in my life. It came to me then I could do anything I wanted to do if I applied myself and went for it. I never lost that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why, when a few African American theater arts students approached him on campus 30 years ago and described their feelings of isolation and how they saw few stories that reflected themselves in the curriculum they studied, Williams felt that same determination. Even though he was doing technical work for the department and had no funding besides his own wallet, he agreed to start an African American theater troupe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, AATAT&#8212;the only student African American theater troupe in the University of California system&#8212;has staged plays by African American playwrights like Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winner August Wilson&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Turner&#8217;s Come and Gone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blues for an Alabama Sky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Pearl Cleage, as well as taken up works that deal with issues of race, injustice, and discrimination. It has awarded more than $100,000 in scholarships, has brought its performances into the community, and has amassed a cadre of devoted alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think AATAT is so much more than a student group,&#8221; said Ted Warburton, interim dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It is a spiritual home, a place of belonging for our students of color who oftentimes express real feelings of being unmoored or excluded. It&#8217;s also a place where Don inspires students not only to express themselves but also to take on leadership roles.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Creating the dream</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams&#8217;s love for the theater started with a high school talent show, but he cut his production teeth in Los Angeles, working with actor Ted Lange (from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Love Boat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and Nick Stewart, founder of the Ebony Showcase Theatre. He&#8217;d founded a theater troupe at Michigan State University, where he got his undergraduate degree, pursued an M.F.A. in directing at the University of Southern California, and knew exactly the work he faced to stage a theater production on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He convinced other African American students&#8212;10 in all&#8212;to join the group that first year and picked the play, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceremonies in Dark Old Men </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Lonne Elder III, which deals with issues of Black manhood, family, and racism in America. He bankrolled the production himself, appropriating old props and costumes from the Theater Arts Department and convincing a barber in town to lend him a barber&#8217;s chair, which is the focal point of the play. The students knew they would earn no credits but spent hours rehearsing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The play was offered for three nights at the Stevenson Events Center. Tickets were free. The place was packed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We raised $1,500 in donations, and I asked the audience if they wanted to see this happen again and they cheered,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;So, the next year, I did the play, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amen Corner</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by James Baldwin.&#8221; The play deals with the role of the church in an African American family and the effects of poverty brought on by racial prejudice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of Black students come up in the church,&#8221; Williams said, &#8220;so </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amen Corner</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a natural extension of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even then, the troupe was becoming a family for African American students, who made up a small part of the campus population. By 2019, African American students were still only 4.3 percent of university enrollment. Membership in the troupe has ranged from 15 to 40 in any given year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of (Black students) felt like they were isolated,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;You might find yourself in a dorm and you were the only one on the floor who was Black. You might be on campus a whole year and know only two or three Black people. That makes it hard on students, especially if you come from L.A. or Oakland where you are used to seeing reflections of yourself all around you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, his wife was cooking meals for the troupe and some troupe members joined Williams at his church, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My wife is a good cook and she would make real soul food for them. The students would request her chili and her mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese,&#8221; Williams said. Members of Williams&#8217;s church even pitched in.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Momentum builds</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That second year, I felt the momentum building,&#8221; said Eric Jackson-Scott, M.D. (Rachel Carson &#8217;95, chemistry), an occupational medicine physician who played the role of Theopolis in AATAT&#8217;s first play, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceremonies in Dark Old Men</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The excitement and enthusiasm started to become something bigger. It was the natural evolution of something spectacular.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1995, AATAT became a 5-unit class, and Williams was released from part of his technical job to direct the program. Funding was still problematic but the plays rolled on: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by David Rabe, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fences</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by August Wilson, and the gospel musical </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tambourines to Glory, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with music by Langston Hughes and Jobe Huntley. Money raised from the plays was turned into four scholarships given to students each year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niketa Calame-Harris (Oakes &#8217;02, theater arts), an actor and film producer best known for voicing Young Nala in Disney&#8217;s 1994 animated film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lion King</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, remembered her AATAT role in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before It Hits Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Cheryl West, which dealt with the AIDS crisis and discrimination against gay men.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After our play closed, the rate of students getting tested for AIDS and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) went up,&#8221; Calame-Harris said. &#8220;That was really cool to me. It showed me how art can inform and impact life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams also believed it was important to connect the community to these plays. The troupe has presented its works at the Louden Nelson Community Center in downtown Santa Cruz, at numerous high schools, and at Monterey Peninsula College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When AATAT performed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Soldier&#8217;s Play</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winner Charles Fuller, which is set in 1944 and deals with the murder of a Black sergeant on an Army base, Williams invited to the performance two veterans of an all-Black Army troop, the 54</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coast Artillery Regiment. The regiment was stationed in Santa Cruz during WWII to guard against enemy attack and, according to accounts of the time, faced discrimination from some hostile townspeople. After the performance, Williams talked about issues raised in the play and introduced the two men, recounting their service and weaving the threads of the play with their lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I made them honorary members of the theater troupe,&#8221; Williams said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those after-play dialogues are a regular part of AATAT performances, and so is the student research into topics that underlie each play, according to Williams. The result, said Williams, is that students often begin to not only find themselves and their voice but also feel they can assert their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When students go through that drill, they come out with a whole different mindset,&#8221; Williams said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The theater is grounded in hands-on experience and emotional connections,&#8221; Warburton said. &#8220;Don is producing, in powerful ways, a positive change that combats racism and creates a shared responsibility for sustaining that change now and into the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>You're all right</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask AATAT alumni about Williams ("Papa Don," as he is known to them) and they&#8217;ll describe him as energetic, positive-minded, dedicated, and devoted to student leadership. They&#8217;ll also recall his trademark sayings: &#8220;Uplift one higher than yourself,&#8221; &#8220;You have to believe in some things you can&#8217;t see,&#8221; and his most famous: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what others say about you, you&#8217;re all right with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don taught me time management, leadership skills, communication, and belief in the possible and the impossible,&#8221; Jackson-Scott said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the phone, Williams rolls out his tales like the born storyteller he is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Africa, they have this bird [a metaphorical symbol] called Sankofa whose head faces in one direction with his feet pointed in the other,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;The idea is that in order to understand your future, you must have an understanding of your past. That principle has been with me all my life. I have always wanted to do something with substance that reflects my culture. I&#8217;m really focused on trying to teach students and the community that we have a rich history behind ourselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, &#8220;just tap into the nightly news and think you understand Black people, but I can create a stage and tell you some of those stories&#8221; to help you see and feel and hear that experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s what he and the troupe have been doing for three decades now.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> This profile is a follow-up to an <a href="../../2020/03/laurie-garrett-coronavirus-interview.xml">interview with Laurie Garrett we ran in March 2020</a>, at the very beginning of the pandemic.&#160;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemics expert Laurie Garrett is thrilled that &#8220;the adults are finally in the room&#8221; when it comes to a national COVID-19 response.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett (Merrill '75, biology), an outspoken critic of the Trump administration&#8217;s handling of the COVID outbreak, praised the Biden administration&#8217;s strong emphasis on science and data, and its empathy toward victims of the devastating disease.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen compassion from leadership,&#8221; said Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning science journalist and frequent MSNBC science contributor. &#8220;For the first time, we&#8217;ve seen genuine understanding of grief."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she recently retweeted an exhaustive breakdown of COVID data, released by Andy Slavitt, a senior adviser to the White House's COVID response team, showing viral-test positivity rates, and hospital bed and staff shortages in every state.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the sort of info that we should have been seeing to guide our national and local response for a year," she said, taking a dig at the Trump administration and its shambolic response to the crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may sound like an unusually cheery outlook from Garrett, who warned of a deadly globe-spanning outbreak long before the novel coronavirus spread across the Earth.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But make no mistake; Garrett remains vigilant about the need for an all-out race to stay ahead of highly contagious COVID variants that have made inroads in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s especially concerned about the paltry amount of genomic testing and surveillance that is needed to detect the new variants. The CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna have given interviews saying they are working on rapidly altering their existing vaccines so they will have mRNA code not just for the baseline COVID-19 but for the subtypes, but those vaccination tweaks raise logistical as well as regulatory concerns for Garrett.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then you get to the whole question of how regulatory agencies approve these rapidly. Do we have to do clinical trials all over again? Well, at the pace in which variants are showing up, the virus will keep winning," she said. "On the other hand, we can&#8217;t just throw up our hands and get rid of all safety regulations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A voice of caution and concern</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett has a longstanding reputation of noticing what others aren&#8217;t seeing. Consider the fateful tweet she posted on December 31, 2019, with an understated tone that has come back to haunt her:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A new, mysterious outbreak in China,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Symptoms are described</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SARS?src=hashtag_click"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> #SARS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-like, but there is no evidence yet of human-2-human transmission. And it&#8217;s centered around a fish market in Wuhan, not around live civets, as was the case with SARS. Still, merits watching.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett now wonders at the calmness of that tweet.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rankly I would have sounded a greater alarm even then, except that I&#8217;d taken a lot of beatings on social media,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I was accused of being a fear monger, of whipping up hysteria, and all this kind of stuff, so I took a fairly &#8216;this bears watching&#8217; perspective. What I really wanted to say was, 'Holy crap! My hair&#8217;s on fire!'&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Garrett&#8217;s media presence has increased exponentially. Her Twitter following has ballooned to nearly 240,000, and she is in constant demand to appear on news programs and on panels. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vanity Fair</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have dubbed her a COVID-19 &#8220;Cassandra&#8221; whose warnings went ignored for far too long. Now, she has the nation&#8217;s ear&#8212;and her schedule is often overwhelming.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she adjusts to a breakneck pace, Garrett, like everyone else, is pondering what the future will hold, and what a &#8220;new normal" is going to look like.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was saying to everybody back in February [2020], I was giving this a 36-month &#8216;best case&#8217; timeline," Garrett said. &#8220;The worst case would be we end up with [COVID] as a permanent feature in the global health landscape.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>An all-out race against variants</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worried Americans have some daunting questions about the immediate future as well as the long-term prognosis. For instance, could the United States ramp up genomic testing and surveillance in time to get a better handle on these spreading strains before the situation gets out of control?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett noted that the new administration is trying to keep up with the variants, &#8220;But you can&#8217;t just snap your fingers and have a national mechanism of genomic surveillance. And you can&#8217;t snap your fingers and suddenly fix every single thing that is wrong with the vaccine rollout. There has been something wrong with every single step of&#160; it .&#8230; We are in this reactive mode, and the virus is racing ahead.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett said that the global response to COVID remains &#8220;haphazard&#8221; and without broad agreement between heads of state about a clear strategic plan or even an explicitly stated outcome, ranging from COVID containment to outright eradication.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need a strategic plan,&#8221; Garrett said. She calls Biden&#8217;s COVID response impressive and an enormous improvement over Trump&#8217;s response. &#8220;It&#8217;s nearly 200 pages of basically tactical maneuvers on how to get around the virus. But it doesn&#8217;t state the strategic goal. Is the goal to get everybody back to work, or deal with the economy, or eradicate the virus, or somewhere in between?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in other countries, &#8220;strategic goals are unfortunately nonexistent," she said. &#8220;Containment, elimination, eradication are all specific terms, and nobody wants to make a declaration at this time [because] it&#8217;s politically charged. But because we&#8217;re not doing that, all the tactics we&#8217;re using&#8212;vaccination, testing, quarantine&#8212;are haphazard, reactive. The virus has us by the reins and we are trying to tame the horse while it is bucking all over the place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while she was appalled by the Trump administration&#8217;s COVID response&#8212;she accused him of</span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/2/3/laurie_garrett_coronavirus_trump_admin_response"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;sabotaging America&#8217;s response to the pandemic&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;she noted that few other countries seem to have COVID under control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are not ahead of the virus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere,&#8221; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett said. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closest you get are island countries like Taiwan, Iceland, and New Zealand. They managed to get control within their boundaries, but the new variants are moving quickly around the world and everybody&#8217;s going to face another round. And then there&#8217;s going to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">another</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We clearly have hit an evolutionary tipping point now where there are sufficient numbers of people harboring virus in their bodies for sufficient time so the virus has ample opportunity to evolve.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless there is a successful, massive push to vaccinate areas of the world that have had a disorganized approach to treatments and vaccinations, Garrett said, &#8220;we&#8217;re putting selection pressure on the global viral population."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Garrett warns Americans not to let their guard down.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The mask is still the best protection you have," Garrett said, while expressing regret for remarks she made, early in the pandemic, in which she undervalued the use of mask-wearing indoors. &#8220;We now know this virus is more contagious as an aerosol than influenza, the common cold, and respiratory viruses.&#8221;&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett strongly recommends continued mask use even for those who have already received vaccines.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she commiserates with those who feel that quarantine and isolation has been wearing them down psychologically.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a virus that exploits love and community and fun, and boy, you know, we are all really tired of not having fun," she said. "Our basic human psyche wants us to do the opposite of what we need to do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, every society on Earth is struggling how to resolve the tension between economics and controlling the virus, though the strain is perhaps at a lower volume </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in places that have strong social-safety nets, she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Room for cautious optimism</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett said she&#8217;s heartened by the Biden administration&#8217;s willingness to cooperate with other countries in the global COVID fight.&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;re seeing steps taken to engage with the rest of the world so America is no longer going to be an isolated aberration. We&#8217;ll be a player on the international stage again. All of this is cause for hope,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean that things are right around the corner going to get solved," Garrett cautioned. &#8220;But it does mean that we can begin to think again strategically of a disease that doesn&#8217;t know borders, that can't be controlled in one country, and that requires a scale of international cooperation. And through the mere act of compassion, we can begin to see the vitriolic volume and incorrect protest come down a bit, and Americans can engage in conversation again. That would certainly help.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Xavier Prochaska, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, and his coauthors of a landmark paper describing a fast radio burst from a massive galaxy have been chosen to receive the prestigious Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The prize is given annually to the authors of an outstanding paper published in the association's journal <em>Science</em>.<br/>
<p>UCSC graduate student Sunil Simha is also a coauthor of the paper and made substantial contributions. Prochaska and Simha were part of an international team that determined the precise location of a fast radio burst, a powerful burst of cosmic radio waves, for the first time ever from a single pulse.</p>
<p>Prochaska coordinated the team&#8217;s follow-up observations of the galaxy from which the burst originated, using three of the world&#8217;s largest optical telescopes. The observations revealed that these mysterious signals originate in massive galaxies like our own Milky Way.</p>
<p>The prize-winning paper, &#8220;A single fast radio burst localized to a massive galaxy at cosmological distance,&#8221; was published in <em>Science</em> online on June 27, 2019, and in print on August 9, 2019. It was one of several high-impact papers on fast radio bursts published by Prochaska and his colleagues in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>Prochaska's research sheds light on early cosmology and structure formation in the universe, including the formation and evolution of galaxies. Three times in the previous decade (2011, 2014, and 2015), his discoveries have been recognized by the editors of <em>Physics World, Science,</em> or <em>Astronomy</em> as among the top scientific breakthroughs of the year. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in 2017.</p>
<p>Every year hundreds of ground-breaking research papers are published in the journal <em>Science</em>, but only one is selected for the prestigious AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize, the association&#8217;s oldest award. The best paper is chosen based on the impact in its field and its wider, interdisciplinary significance.</p>
<p>The authors of the winning study will receive the award in a virtual ceremony on February 10 during the 2021 AAAS Annual Meeting.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/06/fast-radio-burst.html</url><title>Astronomers make history in a split second with localization of fast radio burst</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="844e2634807270172c1b96bd7f27cf0d"><name>housing-webinar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Webinar for students to focus on off-campus housing</title><summary>The webinar is filled with helpful resources, information about the housing process and connections with school and city officials. </summary><start-date>1612771200000</start-date><display-name>Housing webinar</display-name><path>/2021/02/housing-webinar</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/housing-webinar</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1612832450072</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612832450072</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/screen-shot-2021-02-08-at-4.59.46-pm.png</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/screen-shot-2021-02-08-at-4.59.46-pm.png</link><site>news</site><name>screen-shot-2021-02-08-at-4.59.46-pm.png</name><display-name>screen-shot-2021-02-08-at-4.59.46-pm.png</display-name><file-size>275759</file-size><width>458</width><height>718</height></image><image-alt>Flier for workshop</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Are you moving off-campus in the fall?

<p>UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/">Academic Excellence (ACE) Program</a> has for decades been helping students succeed in their classes and graduate with degrees in STEM fields. The $450,000 grant from the Genentech Foundation is enabling the program to expand its services and provide the resources students need to succeed in the remote learning environment, with the aim of disrupting the widening equity gaps in STEM retention caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The UCSC <a href="https://ibsc.ucsc.edu/">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells (IBSC)</a> received a $400,000 grant to expand their existing partnership with California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) to provide mentoring, research opportunities, and other support for underrepresented STEM students at CSUMB. The Genentech-sponsored Academic Inspiration Network (GAIN) will give UCSC postdoctoral fellows mentoring experience and training while providing enhanced academic support for CSUMB students.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mesa.ucsc.edu/">MESA College Prep program</a> in UCSC&#8217;s Educational Partnership Center was awarded a $25,000 grant to strengthen its work providing hands-on STEM education, STEM career exploration, and college preparation to high school students who are underrepresented, low income, or first-generation college-bound in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.</p>
<p>Many students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM majors have faced especially difficult challenges in the sudden transition to remote learning driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. ACE Program Director Susanna Honig said the challenges include inadequate internet access and the difficulty of managing online classes while living at home with their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the students we serve have been greatly impacted by the health crisis and the financial crisis, and there is a huge digital divide with respect to the resources needed for remote learning,&#8221; Honig said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more important than ever now to reach out and engage with students. Having these extra resources to maintain and expand our services in a virtual environment will enable us to help more students succeed during this challenging time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Genentech grant will support the ACE Program&#8217;s efforts to serve more students, add additional wraparound services for students who are facing inequities, and connect them to the resources they need. The program will add new staff, including new student staff hired from within the program. In addition, the ACE Program will collaborate with UCSC&#8217;s Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL) to develop and implement new tools and methods to support effective virtual science instruction at UCSC and potentially other institutions as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;By working with CITL, we hope to leverage and extend our impact beyond helping ACE students, so our active learning approach can be translated across the STEM departments at UCSC,&#8221; Honig said.</p>
<p>The GAIN program aims to enhance the learning experience and improve retention of underrepresented STEM students at CSUMB by partnering them with postdoctoral fellows conducting stem cell research at UCSC. The postdocs will receive mentoring training from CSUMB faculty to prepare them for working with the CSUMB students. In each year of the four-year program, it will support three postdoctoral fellows and 10 to 12 CSUMB undergraduates, and six students per year will be able to conduct a summer research project with their postdoc mentor. The grant also provides funds for computers and internet data plans to help students facing barriers to accessing remote learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overall idea is to help students left behind by the COVID-19 crisis,&#8221; said IBSC Program Officer Catharina Casper-Lindley. &#8220;Those challenges are real. Our colleagues at CSUMB say they are losing more students from their classes, not because they aren&#8217;t capable of following the material, but because of the logistics of remote learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GAIN program builds on an existing partnership between IBSC and CSUMB, funded by the National Institutes of Health, to provide training in teaching and mentoring to postdoctoral fellows. Both programs are led by the same team, including Casper-Lindley, Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC, Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC, and Aparna Sreenivasan, associate professor of genetics and molecular biology at CSUMB. The IBSC, originally funded through the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), provides the framework for these various training programs.</p>
<p>The three new grants are funded through Genentech and the Genentech Foundation&#8217;s Diverse Future of STEM Fund, which aims to break down barriers for underrepresented students pursuing careers in science and medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate existing equity gaps, worsening the systemic barriers that students of color face, particularly in the fields of science and medicine,&#8221; said Kristin Campbell Reed, executive director of Genentech corporate and employee giving and the Genentech Foundation. &#8220;Through our support for innovative programming at local and national postsecondary institutions, we hope to help build a more inclusive and diverse scientific and medical community.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.gene.com/stories/giving-for-a-more-just-healthcare-system</url><title>Genentech: Giving for a More Just Healthcare System</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8dd93d7d807270172c1b96bdd017dc8e"><name>kirsten-howley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>What Hollywood gets wrong (and right!) about protecting the Earth from asteroids</title><summary>Meet alumna Kirsten Howley, the real-life astrophysicist working to prevent 'Armageddon'.</summary><start-date>1613059200000</start-date><display-name>What Hollywood gets wrong (and right!) about protecting the Earth from asteroids</display-name><path>/2021/02/kirsten-howley</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/kirsten-howley</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1612992560463</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1613061220624</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>womens-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Robyn Schelenz, UCOP</name><title></title><phone/><email>Robyn.Schelenz@ucop.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSPIUl8DmSE" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption>Asteroids hitting the Earth have been a staple of Hollywood blockbusters for years.

The heroes who stop it in just the nick of time are a group of orange-suited Americans, all men.</p>
<p>Life isn&#8217;t always like the movies.</p>
<p>Not that an asteroid couldn&#8217;t slam into Earth, mind you. Asteroids &#8212; mostly tiny ones &#8212; pass by our planet virtually every second. But the people charged with stopping the big ones aren&#8217;t reaching for their spacesuits with mere hours to spare.</p>
<p>And spoiler alert: They also aren&#8217;t all men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say the number one question I get when I tell people what I work on is, &#8216;Oh, like Armageddon?&#8217; And it&#8217;s nothing like &#8216;Armageddon,&#8217;&#8221; says Kirsten Howley, an astrophysicist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab whose day job includes defending our planet from asteroids.</p>
<p>Howley, who earned her Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz in 2011, doesn&#8217;t have an orange jumpsuit at hand, but her job is serious business. She and her team of planetary defenders specialize in how we might deflect an asteroid that poses a threat to Earth. Like Bennu.</p>
<p>Bennu, weighing more than 78 billion kilograms, is an ancient asteroid currently orbiting the sun on a path that brings it close to Earth. It has a 1-in-2,700 chance of colliding, albeit not until 2185.</p>
<p>Last fall, NASA collected a sample from Bennu, the first NASA mission to procure material from an asteroid as it traveled through space. Those samples, once they make it back to Earth, will help physicists like Howley with their very important job &#8212; to make sure Bennu (and objects like it) don&#8217;t impact.</p>
<p>What that effort requires is a lot more complicated, and less immediately perilous, than the movies would have you think, although the goal of saving life on Earth is just the same.</p>
<p>For starters, Bennu is far more compelling than some dumb rock. What we&#8217;ve already learned, and hope to learn about it, could not only save the planet &#8212; it could also help change our understanding of what an asteroid (or even life) is.</p>
<p><strong>Bennu</strong></p>
<p>Before you think of Bennu simply as a missile hurtling through space, consider it as an object of interest in its own right.</p>
<p>Bennu is much older than Earth. Discovered in 1999, it&#8217;s roughly 4.5 billion years old and is believed to have formed 10 million years before our own solar system. That makes Bennu of extraordinary interest to scientists who want to piece together how our world came to be.</p>
<p>Little NASA spacecraft OSIRIS-REx (or Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer) collected a sample from the asteroid in October 2020, and will return within three years with its precious cargo. Scientists hope these small fragments from Bennu will shed light on the origins of life on Earth; indicate whether we could mine asteroids for rare elements; and signal whether Bennu contains water.</p>
<p>If asteroids do have water, the possibility of humans living far from planet Earth becomes much easier to imagine. Photos from the NASA spacecraft also captured images of particles flying off Bennu a few times a week &#8212; making it what they call an active asteroid, a rare classification.</p>
<p>In short, Bennu will help us learn a lot more about asteroids, and possibly ourselves. Of course, it&#8217;s also as tall as the Empire State building, and possesses an orbit that could get a little too close for comfort.</p>
<p>Study it while we can, but if it gets too close, what will we do? That&#8217;s where Howley comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Planetary defenders</strong></p>
<p>If this were a movie, Howley and her team would be on the poster, among the people tasked with saving the Earth. But Howley, an Oakland native who chased her childhood passion for the stars from community college to UC Santa Cruz, where she became the first person in her family to earn a Ph.D., is not sitting around waiting to jump onto a rocket at a second&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>Because she doesn&#8217;t have to. Her arsenal against Earth-killing asteroids includes physics and math.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA was tasked with finding all of the asteroids that were a kilometer size and larger, and they have found more than 90 percent of those objects that come close to Earth's orbit, any of them that might be a near-Earth object or potentially hazardous,&#8221; Howley says. Howley considers &#8220;close&#8221; to Earth as less than a hundred million miles. Any asteroid that is coming within that distance and is a football field-and-a-half in size, or larger, is potentially hazardous.</p>
<p>You can exhale knowing that there aren&#8217;t any asteroids coming near Earth that fit Howley&#8217;s criteria in this century &#8212; not even Bennu. If it does hit Earth, it won&#8217;t strike until 2175 at the earliest. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Howley and her team aren&#8217;t constantly preparing and improving our asteroid response.</p>
<p>Unlike Bruce Willis, who in the movie is chasing after a Texas-sized asteroid, Howley is far more concerned with smaller objects &#8212; asteroids that are harder to track and find and which won&#8217;t take out the entire world, but could still do major damage.</p>
<p>These are asteroids that can damage a city or a small state, and because they are smaller, they are harder to see. None of these are currently threatening Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any asteroids right now that we are concerned about,&#8221; Howley says.</p>
<p>Asteroids like Bennu allow Howley to collect data about their orbits, so they can extrapolate for future asteroids and develop mitigation strategies that could prevent a hurtful impact. And they help teams like hers to evaluate newly discovered asteroids.</p>
<p><strong>Avengers, assemble</strong></p>
<p>One thing that is like the movies is that preventing a major asteroid from hitting Earth is a team effort. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory specializes in deflection and mitigation strategies. NASA thinks about spotting all the asteroids in the great beyond and how to get to them if they have to do so. Their teams, and teams from all over the world, meet together annually to discuss and simulate asteroid management strategies. Their thinking is very, very long term.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Bennu&#8217;s 1-in-2,700 chance of hitting Earth in 2185.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds scary!&#8221; Howley says. &#8220;However, that probability is going to evolve. 1-in-2700 is because we don't really know with enough accuracy what its orbit is going to be in 2135.&#8221;</p>
<p>2135 contains what is known in astronomy as a keyhole, a moment when the orbit of an object can drastically shift &#8212; to or away from Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we know that better, the odds will change.&#8221; (A collision will become less likely, Howley suspects).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a mitigation strategy for Bennu,&#8221; Howley adds, and we have already demonstrated our capacity to learn more about it &#8212; to send up our OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, for example.</p>
<p>The amount of data we have about Bennu, and our ability to forecast where it will be more than 100 years from now, makes it easy for Howley to sleep at night. As does the ongoing, international work to manage and plan for the threat of other asteroids.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worry more about wearing sunscreen,&#8221; says Howley.</p>
<p>That really means something when you understand just how catastrophic it would be should an asteroid like Bennu hit Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Bennu were to impact Earth today it would release about 2.7 gigatons of energy &#8212; that's more than a million Hiroshima-type bombs and nobody wants that kind of impact,&#8221; Howley says.</p>
<p>But we have studied Bennu&#8217;s orbit well enough to know this is not a threat in the near future.</p>
<p>And thanks to NASA&#8217;s little OSIRIS-REx spacecraft &#8212; the Bruce Willis of this film &#8212; we will soon know more about Bennu&#8217;s composition and mass. That kind of information is really important to developing mitigation strategies, so we can understand how the asteroid would react if, say, we decided our only chance to save Earth was to bomb an asteroid into oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>Explosions in deep space</strong></p>
<p>So what about the explosions? What about the last-minute heroics?</p>
<p>In &#8220;Armageddon,&#8221; Dolly, the aforementioned asteroid the size of Texas (&#8220;we do not know of any asteroid the size of Texas,&#8221; Howley notes), was just an hour from hitting Earth when the movie&#8217;s heroes scrambled to stop it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, we're talking about something that's an 800-mile-in-diameter object that's going to hit Earth in one hour. The amount of energy it would take to push two equal-sized pieces in opposite directions such that they miss Earth [like in the movie] is equivalent to about the total energy output of the sun in a day,&#8221; Howley says. &#8220;And we do not have that capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don&#8217;t need that capability if we can see them coming earlier. The variety of strategies Howley and teams like hers deploy are designed to avoid asteroid-vs.-man showdowns.</p>
<p>Using an explosion to redirect an asteroid &#8212; like in &#8220;Armageddon,&#8221; &#8212; is actually possible, Howley says: &#8220;A nuclear device is not out of the question. It actually is a very efficient approach in terms of depositing energy into a body to give it a push.&#8221; A push away from Earth.</p>
<p>One option Howley is working on to deliver such a push is called HAMMER or Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response.</p>
<p>The hammer, in this case, would be a small spacecraft carrying a nuclear device that would explode on or near the asteroid. This is much different than an explosion on Earth &#8212; all that nuclear energy would go right into the asteroid, rocketing the asteroid away. That little spacecraft, should it ever be sent upon such a mission to Bennu, would benefit from the work of its predecessor, the present-day OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, as we would need to know the composition of an asteroid before attempting such a strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to deposit a bunch of energy and break up the asteroid in an unpredictable way, we want to make sure we know we&#8217;re in control of what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; Howley says.</p>
<p>The 1998 movie &#8220;Deep Impact&#8221; portrays just such a scenario, where an attack on an asteroid causes the asteroid to break into two pieces, still dangerous.</p>
<p>Howley and other planetary defenders have figured out that we can avoid this problem by using some kind of kinetic impactor &#8212; for example, a spacecraft, sans nuclear weapon, that simply rams into the asteroid, and nudges it off course.</p>
<p>The kinetic impactor option also steers clear of the admittedly tough politics that could surround any use of a nuclear weapon for planetary defense. But it&#8217;s something that Howley and other international teams think about how to navigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although I can assure you it&#8217;s safe, there&#8217;s still a perception it is not,&#8221; she says. Fortunately, constant international cooperation has laid the groundwork for diplomacy. Teams around the world meet and simulate how they would respond to threats from both a scientific and political point of view. How would you deal with a skeptical world leader? How would you communicate to a worried public? They run through all of these scenarios, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just think it's good to have a plan,&#8221; Howley says.</p>
<p>Of course you can&#8217;t always plan for every eventuality. Some smaller asteroids are hard to spot &#8212; like the 2020 QG asteroid that passed within 10,000 miles of Earth from the direction of the sun (and probably would have burned up in our atmosphere had it come too close).</p>
<p>Or the Chelyabinsk asteroid in 2013 that exploded in the sky over Russia, causing a blast wave that injured 1,500 people.</p>
<p>NASA is working on a program to improve our capabilities for spotting the harder-to-see ones, which nonetheless have an extremely low probability of causing catastrophic damage on Earth. There are a lot of objects moving around in space, including meteoroids, satellites, and space debris. Of course, the consequences of the low-probability events Howley plans for could be very destructive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm constantly reassuring my friends and family like, &#8216;Oh, there's another one I didn't even know about.&#8217; I think it's good to know that these things are flying by all the time, we've seen a lot of them. Sometimes we don't discover them until they are close to Earth passing by. That is quite common just because they're dim and they're hard-to-see. So it's always good to keep perspective,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But just because something is coming close to Earth doesn't mean that it's a risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are other benefits to Howley and her team&#8217;s work, beyond preparing for scenarios that hopefully never come to pass. Their studies can help advance our understanding of things that are larger than just asteroids, like how life got started on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this information is useful just for science in general, for other ideas that we haven't even thought of that might be outside the box, things that people want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asteroids could one day be a stepping stone for humanity to life on other planets, for example. The idea of mining asteroids for essential elements is another possibility that could come to pass because of the work being done today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists of the present day always benefit from the science that was done before them,&#8221; Howley says. &#8220;All of this will benefit the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, while Howley may get texts from time to time from friends and family worried about the latest asteroid to make headlines, it&#8217;s important to remember, there&#8217;s no need to sensationalize. The sky is vast and fascinating. Step outside and enjoy it &#8212; but don&#8217;t lose any sleep over it. Save the scary stuff for the movies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/asteroid-near-earth-what-do-we-do</url><title>Original post on UC News</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="92ae8eec807270172c1b96bdbef717c3"><name>jones-aaron-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Listening and bringing change</title><summary>Aaron Jones, interim Educational Opportunity Programs director, founded the orientation program Black Academy, which has dramatically increased African Black Caribbean students' retention rate at UCSC.</summary><start-date>1613073600000</start-date><display-name>Listening and bringing change</display-name><path>/2021/02/jones-aaron-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/jones-aaron-profile</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1613073649359</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1613780861318</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>black-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Staff Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/jones-aaron1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/jones-aaron1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jones-aaron1.jpg</name><display-name>jones-aaron.jpg</display-name><file-size>28540</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Aaron Jones, interim director of the Educational Opportunity Programs on campus, organized</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/jones-aaron-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/jones-aaron-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jones-aaron-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jones-aaron-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2184</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aaron Jones, interim director of the Educational Opportunity Programs on campus, organized</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Aaron&#160;Jones, interim director of the Educational Opportunity Programs on campus, organized Black Academy, a six-day orientation program for African Black Caribbean students to help them find their paths through college.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Aaron Jones, interim Educational Opportunity Programs director, founded the orientation program Black Academy, which has dramatically increased African Black Caribbean students' retention rate at UCSC
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Jones grew up in the neighborhoods of Inglewood, Hawthorne, and South Central L.A. His father drove a forklift. His mother worked at the county social services office. Both parents wanted Jones to get a degree but, since neither had been to college themselves, they didn&#8217;t know how to get him there&#8212;or what he could expect when he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when Jones was hired as an African Black Caribbean (ABC) retention specialist at UC Santa Cruz in 2016 and asked to start a program to help ABC students transition to college life, he relied on his own experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones, now interim director of the Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) on campus, organized Black Academy, a six-day orientation program for African Black Caribbean students to help them find their paths through college. Mentors were paired up with new students and sessions were offered to cover basic questions like how to sign up for classes and buy books. Lists of campus resources were handed out. There was socializing and panels to discuss Black identity and how to deal with things like microaggressions that might occur. Friendships formed as students spent the orientation period housed together in the Rosa Parks African American Theme House on campus. This fall will be Black Academy&#8217;s sixth year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We front-load information so the unfamiliar world students walk into will become a bit more familiar,&#8221; said Jones, who, as a first-generation student at UC Riverside, arrived at his dorm room not even knowing he needed to bring his own sheets.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Academy also includes periodic gatherings during the year so new and older members can connect.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results have been impressive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jones, while UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s retention rate for all students after the first year ranges from 70&#8211;80 percent, the same retention rate for students who went through Black Academy is 90&#8211;95 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jones, while programs like Black Academy and EOP aren&#8217;t the only safe place on campus for ABC students, &#8220;it&#8217;s that students find someone in these places that will help them feel safe and gives them the energy (and help) to go out and interact with things that might not be positive,&#8221; Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also about listening and bringing change to the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones, for instance, has created a research fellowship with the Chancellor&#8217;s Office, the African American Resource and Cultural Center, and the Black Student Union that engages undergraduate ABC students to investigate campus experiences relating to housing, policing, and being a Black Muslim on campus, among other topics. It&#8217;s a way, Jones said, for the campus to better understand needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What drives Jones, who completed his doctorate in higher education leadership from Azusa Pacific University in 2019, is a desire to help students not face the same struggles he did as a first-generation Black student and to make sure students are given every chance to succeed, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also is pushed by the need for more change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really do value the work we do and the difference we make, but there is always more to be done and I think that&#8217;s another motivator for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It takes people like me, but it also takes campus leadership to really integrate these structures and turn things around&#8230;. We have to re-examine the whole way we do this work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb

year&#8217;s <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_auOxmhlFQXSwdjLXKOo3wg"><strong><i>Helen Diller Disting</i></strong><i></i></a><strong><i><a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_auOxmhlFQXSwdjLXKOo3wg">uished Lecture in Jewish Studies</a></i></strong> will feature guest author and scholar <strong>Sarah Abrevaya Stein</strong>&#8212;in conversation with UCSC&#8217;s Neufeld-Levin Chair of Holocaust Studies&#160;<strong>Alma Heckman</strong>&#8212;on Wednesday, February 17, at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>In a virtual event presented by the Center for Jewish Studies, they will discuss Stein&#8217;s recent award-winning book, <i>Family Papers: A Sephardic Journey Through the Twentieth Century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span>Admission is free and open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Family Papers</i> explores the history of the Levy family&#8212;Sephardic Jews with roots in the Ottoman city of Salonika (now Thessaloniki, Greece), drawing from their correspondence and records to trace four generations of family history across five continents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In the process, Stein offers a glimpse into the global history of Sephardic Jews, marked by the end of empire, the Holocaust, and diaspora.</span></p>
<p><span>Named one of the best books of 2019 by <i>The Economist and Mosaic </i>magazine<i>, </i>and a <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Editors' Choice, <i>Family Papers</i> was also a National Jewish Book Award finalist.</span></p>
<p><span>As the <i>New York Times </i>noted<i>, </i>&#8220;The account of this one Mediterranean clan, like the best micro-histories, contains much more than a family story, illuminating the forces that shaped the world we live in now&#8230;a superb and touching book about the frailty of ties that hold together places and people.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Stein is a professor of history and the Maurice Amado Chair in Sephardic Studies at UCLA, as well as the Sady and Ludwig Kahn Director of the Alan D. Leve Center for Jewish Studies. She is the author or editor of nine books, including <i>Extraterritorial Dreams: European Citizenship, Sephardi Jews, and the Ottoman Twentieth Century,</i> and <i>Plumes: Ostrich Feathers, Jews, and a Lost World of Global Commerce</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Stein is also the recipient of the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature, three National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and two National Jewish Book Awards.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alma Heckman</strong> is the Neufeld-Levin Chair of Holocaust Studies and assistant professor of history and Jewish studies at UC Santa Cruz. She specializes in the modern Jewish history of North Africa and the Middle East, with an interest in citizenship, political transformations, transnationalism, and empire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Heckman is the author of <i>The Sultan&#8217;s Communists: Moroccan Jews and the Politics of Belonging </i>(Stanford University Press, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span>This event is presented by the Center for Jewish Studies and made possible by the Helen and Sanford Diller Family Endowment for Jewish Studies.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also<i> </i>part of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s yearlong exploration of the theme of&#160;<a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/this-2020-2021-theme-memory/">Memory</a>, focusing on questions such as: &#8220;What can a family&#8217;s letters, photographs, and fragments tell us about the history of nations that don&#8217;t exist and families that have migrated to many continents?&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>And &#8220;What is the relationship between individual memory, collective memory, and history?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The idea is to explore what can memory tell us about our past, present, and future, and how memory is passed down through generations in order to build a better future.</span></p>

The analyses show that the Columbian mammoth that inhabited North America during the last ice age was a hybrid between the woolly mammoth and a previously unknown genetic lineage of mammoth.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03224-9">published February 17 in <em>Nature</em></a>, also provides new insights into when and how fast mammoths became adapted to cold climate.</p>
<p>Coauthor Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said the results &#8220;push back pretty substantially what we&#8217;d come to think of as the oldest possible ancient DNA.&#8221; The previous record was DNA from a 750,000-year-old horse, which Shapiro&#8217;s team analyzed in 2013.</p>
<p>In the new study, researchers were able to analyze the genomes from three ancient mammoths, using DNA recovered from mammoth teeth that had been buried in the Siberian permafrost for 0.7 to 1.2 million years. Around one million years ago there were no woolly or Columbian mammoths, as they had not yet evolved. This was the time of their predecessor, the ancient steppe mammoth.</p>
<p>This is the first time that DNA has been sequenced and authenticated from million-year-old specimens, and extracting the DNA from the samples was challenging. The scientists found that only minute amounts of DNA remained in the samples and that the DNA was degraded into very small fragments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This DNA is incredibly old. The samples are a thousand times older than Viking remains, and even pre-date the existence of humans and Neanderthals&#8221;, said senior author Love Dal&#233;n, professor of evolutionary genetics at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The age of the specimens was determined using both geological data and the molecular clock. The analyses showed that two of the specimens are more than one million years old, whereas the third is roughly 700 thousand years old and represents one of the earliest known woolly mammoths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could tell from the geological and paleontological context that they were old, but we couldn't say with certainty how old,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;Fortunately, the DNA itself provides some clues. Because changes to the genome accumulate in a clock-like way, we could count the differences between these old mammoth genomes and other mammoth genomes (from mammoths that lived sufficiently recently that we can date their bones), and use this to approximate how long ago these old mammoths lived.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected origin</strong></p>
<p>Analyses of the genomes showed that the oldest specimen, which was approximately 1.2 million years old, belonged to a previously unknown genetic lineage of mammoth. The researchers refer to this as the Krestovka mammoth, based on the locality where it was found. The results show that the Krestovka mammoth diverged from other Siberian mammoths more than two million years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;This came as a complete surprise to us,&#8221; said lead author Tom van der Valk. &#8220;All previous studies have indicated that there was only one species of mammoth in Siberia at that point in time, called the steppe mammoth. But our DNA analyses now show that there were two different genetic lineages, which we here refer to as the Adycha mammoth and the Krestovka mammoth. We can&#8217;t say for sure yet, but we think these may represent two different species.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers also suggest that it was mammoths that belonged to the Krestovka lineage that colonized North America some 1.5 million years ago. In addition, the analyses show that the Columbian mammoth that inhabited North America during the last ice age was a hybrid. Roughly half of its genome came from the Krestovka lineage and the other half from the woolly mammoth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important discovery. It appears that the Columbian mammoth, one of the most iconic Ice Age species of North America, evolved through a hybridization that took place approximately 420,000 years ago&#8221;, said co-lead author Patr&#237;cia Pec&#780;nerova&#769;.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution and adaptation</strong></p>
<p>The second million-year-old genome, from the Adycha mammoth, appears to have been ancestral to the woolly mammoth. The researchers could therefore compare its genome with the genome from one of the earliest known woolly mammoths that lived 0.7 million years ago, as well as with mammoth genomes that are only a few thousand years old. This made it possible to investigate how mammoths became adapted to a life in cold environments and to what extent these adaptations evolved during the speciation process.</p>
<p>The analyses showed that gene variants associated with life in the Arctic, such as hair growth, thermoregulation, fat deposits, cold tolerance, and circadian rhythms, were already present in the million-year-old mammoth, long before the origin of the woolly mammoth. These results indicate that most adaptations in the mammoth lineage happened slowly and gradually over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access to such ancient evolutionary history allows us to discover even more about how evolution works,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;There were at least two lineages of mammoths that lived in Siberia during the Middle Pleistocene, and both of these lineages contributed ancestry to mammoths that lived in North America.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Future research</strong></p>
<p>The new results open the door for a broad array of future studies on other species. About one million years ago was a period when many species expanded across the globe. This was also a time period of major changes in climate and sea levels, as well as the last time that Earth&#8217;s magnetic poles changed places. Because of this, the researchers think that genetic analyses on this time scale have great potential to explore a wide range of scientific questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the big questions now is how far back in time we can go. We haven&#8217;t reached the limit yet. An educated guess would be that we could recover DNA that is two million years old, and possibly go even as far back as 2.6 million. Before that, there was no permafrost where ancient DNA could have been preserved,&#8221; said Anders G&#246;therstr&#246;m, a professor in molecular archaeology and joint research leader at the Centre for Palaeogenetics.</p>
<p>The study is the result of an international collaboration involving 22 scientists from nine countries.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Since COVID-19 emerged just over a year ago, our campus community and our university operations have gone through change, uncertainty and countless impacts to our daily lives both on and off-campus. Throughout the journey, our fellow Slugs have stepped in and stepped up to work on COVID-19 response, resumption and resiliency planning. We have learned a lot and are in a continual cycle of planning and adaptation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba aims to change the national conversation around &#8220;racialized and gendered systems of violence organized through the prison industrial complex (PIC), which includes prisons, policing, and surveillance.&#8221; She said that she was moved to fight for abolition &#8220;when I realized that prison in fact normalizes and reproduces violence rather than ending it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba, an educator, organizer, author, and activist, is the founder and director of Project NIA, which works to end youth incarceration. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also a researcher at </span><a href="https://www.interruptingcriminalization.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interrupting Criminalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Research in Action at the </span><a href="http://bcrw.barnard.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnard Center for Research on Women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project she cofounded with police misconduct attorney and organizer Andrea Ritchie in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The convocation had an unprecedented all-virtual format because of COVID-19, which served as a jumping-off point for Kaba&#8217;s lecture and dialogue with Associate Feminist Studies Professor Gina Dent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those of us here today have survived 2020, a year defined by a global pandemic and expanding economic crisis and some of the largest racial justice protests the U.S. has ever seen,&#8217;&#8217; Kaba said. &#8220;What a time to be alive, as the young folks like to say.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her lecture, Kaba traced her activism to uproot racialized violence back to when she was a teenager living in New York City. But she emphasized that her mission was not just about dismantling the PIC. It was also about &#8220;helping local communities targeted by the [PIC] to be stronger, healthier, and more self-determined. I&#8217;m a PIC abolitionist because I want to dismantle a system predicated on death, and to build one focused on life and safety.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of her lecture emphasized the importance of creating, building up, and maintaining &#8220;a world where we have everything we need: food, shelter, education, health, art, beauty, clean air, and more; as an abolitionist, I&#8217;m trying to prefigure the world in which I want to live. Our work isn&#8217;t just a movement </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">agains</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">t cages and cops. It&#8217;s a movement</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different ways of living together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her remarks, Kaba referenced the legacy and impact of Martin Luther King Jr., lingering in King&#8217;s spirit of mutual aid during the Montgomery Bus Boycott from December 5, 1955, to December 20, 1956.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1956, Montgomery police arrested King on the grounds that he had been&#8212;just barely&#8212;speeding, going a measly five miles over the speed limit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He knew the real reason he had been harassed was he had been using his car to help participants in the boycott,&#8221; Kaba said. During his time in solitary confinement, he penned his famous &#8220;Letter From a Birmingham Jail.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba used that&#160; painstakingly organized &#8220;carpool or rideshare system, which brought an end to the segregated bus system in Montgomery,&#8221; as a shining example of the mutual aid needed in the fight against the PIC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I share this example &#8230; because people don&#8217;t make the connection between the boycott and mutual aid,&#8221; a term that keeps coming up in news stories over the past year or so, when self-determination helped communities survive the pandemic and stand up to anti-Black violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When cities locked down this spring across the world, people took it upon themselves to deliver groceries to the elderly and immunocompromised,&#8217;&#8217; Kaba noted. &#8220;Organizers stocked networks of fridges and pantries with free food and distributed hand sanitizers.&#8230; In June, during a protest against police brutality, volunteers handed out water, warm food, masks, and massages. A few weeks later during the West Coast wildfires, mutual aid groups handed out water and offered free food to firefighters [and fire victims].&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same spirit of &#8220;cooperation for the sake of good [and] creating reciprocal relationships with care&#8221; can also help abolitionist activists prevail in the long term, she said. &#8220;The key things to remember about mutual aid is it empowers communities to meet needs like housing, healthcare, food, and transportation. It is premised on solidarity, not charity. It rejects saviorism, hierarchy, and authoritarianism. Mutual aid exposes the failures of the current system and shows an alternative.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba emphasizes that the fight for justice is a collective struggle. When skeptics suggest that &#8220;marching &#8230; doesn&#8217;t accomplish anything,&#8221; Kaba is quick to remind them that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 happened in the wake of mass demonstrations against racism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So make sure that you find your people, that you work with others to change the world," she said. "Don&#8217;t be a lone ranger!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her remarks, Kaba had a dialogue with Professor Dent, who praised her work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to tell you how proud and happy I am to have you with us,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;You are always an incredible organizer.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dent noted that Santa Cruz and the Bay Area are important places for the development of the prison abolition movement. She praised Kaba for the advocacy work she has done on behalf of more than 100 Black men who were subjected to torture by police to extract confessions. Kaba has advocated for reparations for the torture survivors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason I&#8217;m asking about this is because many people are looking for the kinds of [advocacy work] you are providing for us tonight,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;These examples show us what we can do now. Abolition isn&#8217;t something in the future. Abolition is something we&#8217;re living now and working on.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba has cofounded multiple other organizations and projects over the years including </span><a href="http://wechargegenocide.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Charge Genocide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://chicagofreedomschool.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Freedom School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Chicago Taskforce on Violence against Girls and Young Women, </span><a href="https://loveprotect.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love &amp; Protect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://just-practice.org/just-practice-collaborative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Practice Collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://survivedandpunished.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survived &amp; Punished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is a member of the Movement for Black Lives Policy Table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaba offers a radical analysis that influences how people think and respond to how violence, prisons, and policing affect the lives of people of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is the author of </span><a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1345-missing-daddy"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing Daddy</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which a child narrator explores the emotions she feels surrounding her father&#8217;s incarceration. Her forthcoming book, </span><a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1664-we-do-this-til-we-free-us"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Do This &#8216;Til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be published this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under normal circumstances, the convocation is held in downtown Santa Cruz. It celebrates the life, dream, and enduring vision of Martin Luther King Jr. High-profile speakers who have addressed the crowd at the convention include Yolanda King, activist, actress, and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr.; the late actress and activist Cicely Tyson; Harvard University professor Cornel West; author and social activist bell hooks (Ph.D. &#8217;83, literature); and poet, commentator, activist, and professor Nikki Giovanni.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

of Berkeley Engineering Tsu-Jae King Liu to kick off this year&#8217;s Women in Tech Symposium with a &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; on defining the new era of human-computer interaction.</p>
<p>Now in its fifth year, this annual symposium will showcase sector opportunities, current challenges, and the career paths of experts in human-computer interaction (HCI). The <a href="https://wit.berkeley.edu/women-in-tech-symposium/">Fifth Annual Women in Tech Symposium on the New Era of Human Computer Interaction</a> will take place virtually on Friday, March 12.</p>
<p>Human-computer interaction is a multidisciplinary field that combines new technology in cyber-physical systems with human-centered design and usability. The symposium will examine leading-edge technologies and challenges to ensuring equitable and inclusive HCI. The <a href="https://cce.ucsc.edu/">Center for Computational Experience</a> in UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering is a cosponsor of the symposium, which is organized by <a href="https://citris-uc.org/">CITRIS and the Banatao Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Katherine Isbister, the center&#8217;s director and a professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz, will host a panel discussion on human-computer interaction and games.</p>
<p>&#8220;This panel brings together women with deep expertise in different areas at the intersection of games and human-computer interaction,&#8221; Isbister said. &#8220;They are all doing interesting work, and they show the surprising breadth of work being done in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panelists include UCSC alumna Anne Sullivan, an assistant professor of digital media at Georgia Tech and director of the StoryCraft Research Lab; Rilla Khaled, an associate professor of design and computation arts at Concordia University in Montreal and director of the Technoculture, Art, and Games Research Center; and Regan Mandryk, professor of computer science at the University of Saskatchewan and a pioneer in the study of games users and their experiences.</p>
<p>Isbister&#8217;s research focuses on developing new methods for improving the experience of interactive technologies. She is particularly interested in designing games and other interactive experiences that heighten social and emotional connections. She is the author of several books, including <em>Better Game Characters by Design</em> and, more recently, <em>How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design</em>.</p>
<p>Takayama, who studies human-robot interaction, is also affiliated with the Center for Computational Experience, which brings together faculty with expertise in engineering, arts, humanities, and design. Takayama uses her background in psychology, cognitive science, and HCI to examine human encounters with new technologies. Prior to joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2016, she was a senior user experience researcher at GoogleX and was a research scientist and area manager for human-robot interaction at Willow Garage. She is a World Economic Forum Global Future Council Member and Young Global Leader.</p>
<p>Other speakers at the symposium include Katia Canepa Vega (UC Davis), Ankita Raturi (Purdue University), Jenna Rodriguez (CERES Imaging), Christina Harrington (DePaul University), and Uma Balakrishnan (Tesla). The event will also feature presentations of the Women in Tech Initiative&#8217;s Athena Awards. Melody Ivory, technologist at Thrivafy, will close the event with a talk titled &#8220;Sustainable Disruption: Ensuring an #InclusiveHCI Future Is Not Enough.&#8221;</p>

It is a grand achievement for a small theater group willed into existence by a visionary staff member and a dozen students to be thriving three decades later. The troupe, whose history and evolution are </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/aatat-30th-anniversary.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed in this issue of Tuesday Newsday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has contributed greatly to the vibrancy of our campus.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our entire community is made richer by the spaces the troupe provides, by the performances its student actors deliver, and by the community service in which they engage. Each generation of AATAT students has sought to create new forms of theater and service, including mentoring high school students and distributing more than $100,000 in scholarships. Students this year have risen above the challenges of the pandemic, designing online theater productions and virtual outreach programs for high schools throughout the state, forging new ways to build a more equitable, anti-racist world.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The troupe has also served as a valuable space for our Black students, providing them with an outlet to express their experiences and a way to ensure that their voices and histories are valued and represented in our campus community.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally important to us is the foundation that the troupe provides for its members after their time on campus. Yes, some work as performers, but all are prepared to serve as leaders in their communities, whether as engineers or attorneys, actors or activists.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate the opportunity to share a message of celebration that highlights the excellence of our Black students and alumni, and to promote the deep healing Black theater can offer both actors and audiences.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So congratulations, troupe members, past and present. And a heartfelt thank you, Don Williams, for your 30 years encouraging students to both tread the boards and to create a better world while doing so. Theater is an imaginative collaboration that brings new worlds to life and allows us to imagine our world differently. UC Santa Cruz is a different and better place today because of the work of the African American Theater Arts Troupe.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b1c03e7a807270172c1b96bdc470e507"><name>fall-planning</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preliminary update on fall planning</title><summary>Last month the Office of the President shared a message that all UC campuses planned to return to primarily in-person instruction in the fall and that early decision-making has given us a long planning runway to prepare and incorporate feedback.</summary><start-date>1613548800000</start-date><display-name>Preliminary update on fall planning</display-name><path>/2021/02/fall-planning</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/fall-planning</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1613594902110</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662576159501</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Thank you for attending last week&#8217;s forum and for your questions and feedback as we work together to bring back in-person instruction in fall 2021. A <a href="https://video.ibm.com/recorded/129388788">recording of the forum</a> is available to watch online. Last month the Office of the President shared a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/planning-for-fall-quarter.html">message</a> that all UC campuses planned to return to primarily in-person instruction in the fall and that early decision-making has given us a long planning runway to prepare and incorporate feedback.</p>
<p>In the next month, we will share more detailed plans. This message is meant to share some of the planning assumptions we are currently working with so that everyone can begin to think through their own plans for fall.</p>
<p>These assumptions could be impacted by a host of factors including the speed of the vaccination rollout across our communities. If there are challenges that delay the rollout, the assumptions below will need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>We are anticipating updated statewide guidance for higher education institutions to come out later this year. This guidance could require us to further adjust our plans. The guidance used for our current academic year was released in August, after many universities began fall instruction.</p>
<p>Below are the key general planning assumptions for fall quarter. Individual circumstances may vary for a variety of reasons, including adjustments or accommodations required by law:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be remote teaching and learning options for fall quarter. We plan to provide options that will allow students to remain fully remote by providing most classes needed for making progress toward degrees remotely.&#160;
<ul>
<li>Larger lectures will be remote/online only and discussion sections could be a mix of in-person and remote.</li>
<li>Instructors will be encouraged to design class sessions for either in-person students or for remote students, but to try not to engage students in both modalities at the same time.</li>
<li>Some courses could have two offerings, one in-person and one remote/online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For in-person courses, we are exploring scenarios for 50 percent classroom occupancy to facilitate social distancing, well-being and COVID mitigation.</li>
<li>We are exploring scenarios for two-thirds on-campus housing occupancy to facilitate appropriate distancing, well-being, and COVID mitigation.&#160;</li>
<li>Departments, colleges, and other course-sponsoring units will receive guidance on in-person instruction in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Flexibility is key &#8212; plans and scenarios may change based on the progress of the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our planning values are flexibility, community well-being, COVID mitigation, and ensuring educational access as we learn to work together in a new environment. Our plans continue to be subject to change due to variable health and safety conditions. We are committed to transparent communication and the prioritization of well-being.&#160;</p>
<p>We welcome questions and concerns. We do not have all of the answers, but we are using your questions and feedback to inform our planning processes and decision-making.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, and Herbie Lee, Vice Provost, Academic Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b60e2094807270172c1b96bdd0d56998"><name>fairness-in-ai</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer scientist Yang Liu wins $1M grant for research on fairness in AI</title><summary>Liu’s research aims to achieve more equitable outcomes from decision-making tools based on automated machine-learning algorithms.</summary><keywords>Yang Liu, Fairness in AI</keywords><start-date>1613635200000</start-date><display-name>Computer scientist Yang Liu wins $1M grant for research on fairness in AI</display-name><path>/2021/02/fairness-in-ai</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/fairness-in-ai</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1613667115125</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1668624405130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/yang-liu-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/yang-liu-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yang-liu-350.jpg</name><display-name>yang-liu-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>65066</file-size><width>350</width><height>477</height></image><image-alt>Yang Liu</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/yang-liu-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/yang-liu-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yang-liu-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>yang-liu-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18054</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Yang Liu</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Yang Liu</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Liu’s research aims to achieve more equitable outcomes from decision-making tools based on automated machine-learning algorithms</article-subhead><article-text><p>Yang Liu, assistant professor of computer science and engineering in the <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz, has received $1 million in funding from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) and Amazon for research on the long-term effects of human interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) systems used to support decision-making.</p>
<p>Liu&#8217;s project, called &#8220;Fairness in Machine Learning with Human in the Loop,&#8221; is funded through the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505651">NSF&#8217;s Program on Fairness in AI in Collaboration with Amazon</a>. Machine learning is a powerful data-driven approach that is now being used in many ways that affect people&#8217;s lives, prompting growing concerns about how to ensure that the technology is fairly and responsibly deployed and leads to equitable outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people started trying to automate decisions using machine learning, they realized that the algorithms can introduce bias to the decision-making process,&#8221; Liu explained. &#8220;These algorithms can inherit and reinforce pre-existing biases in the datasets that are used to train them, so a lot of studies focus on ways to remove the bias when training the model.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said less attention has been paid to the long-term consequences of deploying machine-learning models as people interact with them and respond to the decisions they generate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The focus on static datasets does not address the dynamic interaction between people and AI,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;We want to build a framework to capture the interaction between machine learning and human behavior, so we can understand how it affects people in the long run and how machine learning can be used to improve people&#8217;s well being in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liu&#8217;s team has a broad range of expertise and includes researchers at the University of Michigan, Ohio State University, and Purdue University. The project will include a substantial experimental component, which will generate high-quality data from human subjects to help validate and improve the modeling assumptions used in the analysis and algorithmic design.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m particularly excited about this part of the project, because typically we don&#8217;t have good data on how people respond and make sequential decisions over time,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;So the first part is very mathematical and analytical, and then the experimental part will give us data to see how people really interact with these models.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea for the experiment is to use an online crowdsourcing platform to create something like an online game that will allow the researchers to observe how people respond to a machine-learning system for making decisions about, for example, loan applications. People recruited for the experiment would be assigned a role with a certain profile, and the system would provide feedback after a decision is made, allowing people to take actions to improve their chances on the next round.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I apply for a loan and get denied, I want the model to suggest actions for me. I want to hear that, if you change this feature of your profile, your chance of approval will be higher next time,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>When people respond in self-interested ways, however, it can lead to feedback loops with unexpected and unintended consequences. That&#8217;s why the project focuses on &#8220;the human in the loop,&#8221; placing the feedback and strategic nature of the human element front and center to provide a better perspective on the long-term impacts of algorithmic decision-making.</p>
<p>Liu said the project is a great fit for UC Santa Cruz, which has strong programs in data science, human-computer interaction, and ethical algorithms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The environment here is great, with a lot of interest and expertise in both the technical and the ethical aspects of this technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The students are interested in this too, and the grant provides an opportunity to engage more undergraduates in this research and to raise awareness of the issue of fairness in AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>NSF and Amazon have partnered to jointly support computational research focused on fairness in AI, with the goal of contributing to trustworthy AI systems that are readily accepted and deployed to tackle grand challenges facing society. Liu&#8217;s project was awarded $625,000 from NSF and $375,000 from Amazon through this program.</p>
<p>&#8220;NSF is delighted to join with Amazon to support this year&#8217;s cohort of FAI projects,&#8221; said Henry Kautz, director of the NSF&#8217;s Division for Information and Intelligent Systems. &#8220;Understanding how AI systems can be designed on principles of fairness, transparency and trustworthiness will advance the boundaries of AI applications. And it will help us build a more equitable society in which all citizens can be designers in and benefit from these technologies.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b62f1d03807270172c1b96bd827e2b2e"><name>champion-of-science</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Representative Lofgren named 2021 ‘Champion of Science’</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz and the UC system nominated Rep.

Rep. Lofgren joins this distinguished group of policymakers for her unwavering dedication to federal investment in scientific research during her more than 20 years in office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rep. Lofgren&#8217;s consistent support for federal investment in scientific research helps to ensure that our nation&#8217;s research universities will continue as innovation leaders,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Her support of legislation to advance science and innovation and her leadership on reforming our nation&#8217;s immigration system are certainly deserving of the Champion of Science award.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz and the University of California system nominated Rep. Lofgren for the award. As the Chair of the Committee on House Administration and a senior member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep. Lofgren has supported legislation to advance science and ensure a strong research workforce now and in the future, including the Scientific Integrity Act and Research Investment to Spark the Economy (RISE) Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rep. Lofgren is a true Champion of Science,&#8221; said John Latini, president of the Science Coalition. &#8220;As our nation&#8217;s researchers work tirelessly to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect their communities, Rep. Lofgren&#8217;s dedication to securing robust, predictable federal investment in fundamental science research meant the U.S. was better equipped to tackle the crisis.

<p>Since 1999, more than 100 members of Congress have been recognized with the Champion of Science Award for their efforts to secure federal funding for fundamental scientific research through their voting records, bill sponsorships, letters of support, or other activities aimed at boosting scientific discovery. Awardees were selected both for their support of research institutions and their efforts to ensure fundamental scientific advancement across all disciplines.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bc532df7807270172c1b96bdecbdfb6c"><name>covid19-vaccine-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on COVID-19 vaccination distribution</title><summary>COVID-19 vaccine planning continues to be a concentrated focus for our campus.

This message updates where we are with campus vaccinations and also provides the latest information we have on the rapidly changing framework and vaccine-distribution model that the state of California is implementing.</p>
<p>As of Feb. 12, our campus has provided first-dose COVID-19 vaccinations to 600 individuals. Approximately 200 of those people (primarily our health-care workers, who are in what the state refers to as the Phase 1A category) have received a second dose. We will be vaccinating another 200 individuals this Friday, bringing the total number of those who have received first doses from campus to 800.</p>
<p>As you can see in the table below, we have now reached the point where we have opened up appointments for all onsite employees in Group 3. If you are in this category, you should have received an emailed vaccination appointment invitation from Student Health Services to your UC Santa Cruz account. The email contains all of the information you need to make your appointment. Appointment times have filled quickly. As not everyone who is invited to receive a vaccine chooses to get one, and some get them through another provider, the number of invites must be larger than the number of appointment slots. While we understand that there are not enough slots to accommodate all eligible Phase IB Group 3 employees at this time, we will add slots based on the number of doses we receive. As we shared in our <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/update-on-covid-19-vaccine-distribution.html">prior vaccine updates</a>, the number of campus affiliates who fall into Groups 1-3 in the table below is more than 2,000. Please continue to monitor the online appointment system for available openings. Our <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html">Student Health Center</a> team members are working diligently to support our campus community.</p>

<p>As stated at our COVID-19 information forum on Friday, Feb. 12, a <a href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/WfRRwzKR4We">video</a> of which is available online, the state guidelines related to vaccine eligibility and distribution processes continue to change. Since Friday, the state has rolled out additional changes to its <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">vaccination framework</a> by incorporating a series of health-related factors into the eligibility considerations. The state has also released more details on the third-party administrator, by posting the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/Blue-shield-of-california-GovOps.pdf">Blue Shield contract</a> online. Blue Shield will manage vaccine distribution for the state moving forward.</p>
<p>As the state distribution model is implemented through this arrangement with Blue Shield, the role that UC Santa Cruz plays as a vaccine clinic for our own population will change. More information will be shared as details become available.</p>
<p>In the meantime, and contingent upon our ability to receive doses for allocation, we continue to provide vaccines through our campus clinic to the members of our campus community who meet the state and UC Office of the President eligibility criteria. Though we originally anticipated receiving 200 doses each week for the next two weeks, changes to state distribution guidelines now make that uncertain. Looking further out, we are not sure whether we will remain an eligible vaccination site or what our dose allocation will be.</p>
<p>Though we are optimistic as more vaccines enter the supply chain in our state, we recognize that the continual modifications in eligibility criteria and distribution process can cause uncertainty, concern and stress. We continue to encourage everyone to get the vaccine through the earliest option provided to you through community clinics. All of these clinics still can be impacted by dose shortages, including issues arising this week due to the inclement weather across the country. You can use the state&#8217;s <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">MyTurn application</a> to check your vaccine eligibility. If you are in Santa Cruz County, you can access the county&#8217;s <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx">vaccine webpage</a> for additional information on local options for vaccine clinics.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued patience as we all navigate the rapidly changing vaccination landscape in our state and community. You can find additional information on our vaccine distribution at the Student Health Center COVID-19 <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html">vaccine website</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c6577007807270172c1b96bda2cbde05"><name>big-creek-flood</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Massive debris flow swamps Big Creek Reserve as heavy rains follow summer wildfire</title><summary>Boulders the size of vehicles and decades-old redwoods were ripped from the banks of the Big Creek drainage when an atmospheric river inundated the Landels-Hill Big Creek Natural Reserve on the Big Sur coast in late January. &#13;

(Photo by Mark Readdie)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boulders the size of vehicles and decades-old redwoods were ripped from the banks of the Big Creek drainage when an atmospheric river inundated the Landels-Hill Big Creek Natural Reserve on the Big Sur coast in late January.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 14 inches fell in two bouts in a 50-hour period between Jan. 26 and Jan. 28, Big Creek Reserve manager Mark Readdie said. Rainfall on the ridgetops could have been even higher but it&#8217;s not known because the Dolan Fire destroyed a National Weather Service weather station last August as it swept across the reserve&#8217;s 8,000 acres that UC Santa Cruz manages as part of the UC Natural Reserve system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fire left hillsides stripped of vegetation and created a lot of loose soil and hazard trees, Readdie said. Once the rain hit the soil began to move. Essentially the hills melted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geologists are investigating exactly what happened. Readdie said they don&#8217;t know whether there was a single large landslide in the Big Creek drainage or multiple slides across the 16 square miles of watershed. In any case, a huge amount of material and a lot of force &#8212; a high-flow event &#8212; struck the watershed and rumbled toward the coast.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a note to his colleagues Jan. 30, Readdie called it a &#8220;mass-wasting event&#8221; somewhere up the Big Creek fork.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logs that had been in the creek channel for decades began to move, formed a logjam and then burst free the night of Jan. 27 or early Jan. 28, Readdie said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, logs and debris removed trees and boulders from the creek bank. At one point the water looked to be nearly 20 feet above the past creek bed level. The canyon road in several places is buried in debris, inundated with water, or damaged, Readdie reported.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cove at the coast, once 12 to 15 feet deep and filled with kelp, is now a beach filled with gravel and sediment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same storm and same physics washed out Highway 1 at Rat Creek just two miles north of the Big Creek Reserve, cutting off access from the north.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a silver lining, Readdie said: &#8220;We got hit with the fire, we got hit with the flood. The amazing thing is we skipped having our facilities damaged.&#8221;&#160; One structure was lost &#8212; the shower between the Gatehouse and the creek was crushed by logs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task now for Readdie and the five other Big Creek Reserve staff members is to deal with infrastructure repair, get potable water back in operation, repair communications systems, and &#8220;get access back to our roads,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though staff and firefighters were able to protect the reserve&#8217;s buildings when the wildfire hit six months ago it destroyed the campground where groups of students would stay, and some above-ground water pipes were burned. The flood then finished the job, ripping out pipes, wrapping some around trees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Creek Reserve is a research station, a classroom, and a laboratory. Its guiding principle is to contribute to the understanding of ecological processes as they occur and to provide a benchmark for interpreting long-term environmental change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without question, Big Creek is experiencing environmental change. &#8220;Big impacts define the landscape,&#8221; said Readdie, who obtained his undergrad and Ph.D at UC Santa Cruz and who has managed the reserve since 2007.&#160; &#8220;We had a big fire and a massive hydrological event.&#8221; Scientists continue to study the effects of the fire, now they will also study the geology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Creek continues to inspire, Readdie said, but the big question now is what is the new normal as nature takes its course. How to facilitate research and teaching while preserving the ecological integrity of the reserve.&#160; From an operational view, the canyon road is not usable, portions of an interpretive trail are gone. What will be repaired and what will be allowed to remain as is?</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c863bdc1807270172c1b96bd30ff7c6a"><name>three-minutes-moving</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bringing physical engagement into the online teaching and learning environment</title><summary>A new series of videos is now available to UCSC students, faculty, and staff to help offset the increasingly sedentary lifestyle generated by the Covid-19 pandemic.</summary><keywords>covid-19, sedentary lifestyle, remote learning, zoom,  dance, yoga, martial arts, movement,  online exercise, ucsc arts division, uc Santa Cruz news, ucsc online education, ucsc arts division news</keywords><start-date>1613976000000</start-date><display-name>3 Minutes Moving</display-name><path>/2021/02/three-minutes-moving</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/02/three-minutes-moving</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1613974715810</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1613976182074</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/3-minute-movement-500.png</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/3-minute-movement-500.png</link><site>news</site><name>3-minute-movement-500.png</name><display-name>3-minute-movement-500.png</display-name><file-size>252215</file-size><width>500</width><height>321</height></image><image-alt>UCSC online education 3 Minutes Moving videos</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/three-minute-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/three-minute-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>three-minute-thumb.png</name><display-name>three-minute-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>20067</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>dancer from UCSC online education 3 Minutes Moving videos</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>A new series of videos is now available to UCSC students, faculty, and staff to help offset the increasingly sedentary lifestyle generated by the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>Organized by theater arts dance lecturer Cid Pearlman, <i>3 Minutes Moving</i> (3MM) offers easy access to physical engagement with a variety of three-minute movement experiences&#8212;presented by accomplished teachers in dance, martial arts, and contemplative movement practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>These free videos are designed to promote health and wellness for all body types, and no previous movement training is necessary. 3MM is a project of UCSC Online Education in collaboration with the dance faculty of UCSC&#8217;s Theater Arts Department, with support from Porter College and the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History.</span></p>
<p><span>Pearlman explained how this project came about.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Along with my position as a dance lecturer in theater arts, I currently work as an instructional designer with UCSC Online Education&#8212;this is a CARES Act funded position and gives me the opportunity to support faculty bringing their courses online during these challenging and difficult times,&#8221; said Pearlman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Shortly after I began working with Online Education, I had a distanced backyard visit with my friend and UCSC dance/theater arts colleague Cynthia Ling Lee. One of the things we talked about was the need to bring physical engagement into the online teaching and learning environment in a way that would reach people who don&#8217;t necessarily have a regular movement practice. This sparked the idea of <em>3 Minutes Moving</em> (3MM).&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We spend so much time now in front of our screens and we need to move our bodies. I think three minutes is a short enough amount of time that folks won&#8217;t be intimidated to try something new,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Tapping her network of colleagues in dance, martial arts, yoga, and other related practices, Pearlman reached out to a dozen artists initially, ones that she knew could succeed in the abbreviated format. The series began in January, featuring six artists, and more videos are being added each month through the end of June.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Pearlman noted that the homemade feel of the 3MM videos is intentional, with each artist creating<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>their own video with whatever technology they have at hand. Some are more produced and edited,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>while others are shot on phones in one take.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;What&#8217;s important to me is the connection the 3MM artist makes with the viewer&#8212;that the person watching feels invited to move,&#8221; said Pearlman. &#8220;Some movement practices are more contemplative and can be done seated, and others are quite energetic and can be a bit challenging.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>She added that 3MM is hosted publicly on UCSC Online Education&#8217;s YouTube channel and can be accessed by anyone. It can also be imported as a Module into any Canvas Commons course. &#8220;Our hope is that faculty in all disciplines will include 3MM videos in their courses and encourage their students to move.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Pearlman&#8217;s campus colleagues</strong> have been very supportive of the new project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;As a dancer, I have always known the value of a movement practice and how it helps to balance emotional and physical wellbeing,&#8221; said Porter College provost and associate professor of theater arts, Gerald Casel. &#8220;These 3-minute snippets give us a rich resource for sharing and learning about our bodies, and how to connect more deeply to ourselves&#8212;from the slow and cellular to the vigorous and rhythmic aspects of dance practice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We also get to experience a wide variety of movement styles that are often imbued with cultural inflections that highlight the kinetic diversity of expression and possibility for emotional richness,&#8221; Casel added.</span></p>
<p><span>UCSC Online Education director Michael Tassio noted that<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><span>after a quarter of remote instruction, there was growing evidence of the impact COVID-19 was having on the physical and mental health of students, faculty and staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;None of us were used to being at a computer for such long&#160;periods&#160;of time, or to having our interactions with others transposed&#160;to Zoom, email, and texts,&#8221; said Tassio. &#8220;<i>3 Minutes Moving</i> is a small step towards improving mental health by interjecting physical&#160;activity into our daily routines. Even if you can't follow&#160;each movement, they are sure to make you smile and improve your day.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>

<p><span>A program of the Leonardo International Society for Art, Science, and Technology (ISAST), the mission of LASER is to encourage contribution to the cultural environment of a region by fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and opportunities for community building.</span></p>
<p><span>On Thursday, March 11, the&#160;<a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/"><strong><i>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</i></strong></a>&#160;at UC Santa Cruz will present its first LASER talk of 2021&#8212;now continuing in a virtual format&#8212;beginning at 5 p.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The event will feature research presentations by <strong>Jasmine Alinder</strong>, Dean of the Humanities (&#8220;<i>Representing Japanese American Incarceration</i>&#8221;), and <strong>Katharyne Mitchell</strong>, Dean of the Social Sciences (&#8220;<i>Sanctuary Space and Insurgent Memory</i>&#8221;).</span></p>
<p><span>Admission is free and open to the public with <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_D-YA-aa_Qv6rxYK_Wr3nnQ"><em><strong>registration</strong></em></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;LASER Talks have always been quite popular, and since last spring, when they moved online, hundreds of people from the Santa Cruz community and beyond have tuned in to experience the rich program of talks by&#160;nationally and internationally renowned&#160;UC Santa Cruz faculty and other scholars and artists,&#8221; noted Rachel Nelson, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The talks offer lively insights into the work being done on campus, and there&#8217;s clearly a lot of interest in the exchange of ideas between faculty working in the arts and humanities, and others researching in the social sciences and physical sciences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;For the next LASER, we are particularly thrilled to feature the dean of Humanities, Jasmine Alinder, and dean of the Social Sciences,&#160;Katharyne&#160;Mitchell,&#8221; Nelson added. &#8220;This is going to be a chance to look into the minds of these two visionaries at UC Santa Cruz, to see where their creative ideas and research come from, and find&#160;out what they are working on right now.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Humanities dean Jasmine Alinder is also a professor of history at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;She is an interdisciplinary, community-engaged scholar and teacher of public history, the history of photography, and the history of Japanese-Americans during World War II. As a historian of photography, her research investigates what she characterizes as &#8220;the presumptive right to the camera.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Alinder earned her doctorate in the history of art at the University of Michigan, with an emphasis on the history of photography, her M.A. in art history at the University of New Mexico, and an A.B. in art history from Princeton University. She joined UC Santa Cruz last August from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where she was a professor of history and associate dean of the humanities in the College of Letters and Science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Social Sciences dean Katharyne Mitchell is a professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;Her current research focuses on the ethics, practices and politics of church sanctuary in the protection of refugees in Europe. Her recent books include <i>Making Workers: Radical Geographies of Education</i> (2018), and the co-edited <i>Handbook on Critical Geographies of Migration</i> (2019).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Mitchell is working on a monograph, &#8220;Sanctuary Space: Memories of Insurgency,&#8221; and an edited volume on philanthropy and humanitarianism. She is the author of more than 100 articles and book chapters and the recipient of grants from the MacArthur Foundation, Spencer Foundation, Fulbright Foundation, and National Science Foundation. She also received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2016.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz has always pursued excellence and aspired to distinction &#8212; in teaching, in research, in access to education, in public service. The incredible achievements we have seen in our relatively short history have not happened by chance. Our campus sustains a clear vision for its future, shaped partly through intensive planning efforts undertaken regularly over the span of our 55 years.</p>
<p>A draft of our latest effort, the 2021 UC Santa Cruz Long Range Development Plan, was released last month. It reflects four years of work by campus leaders and planners, plus extensive collaboration with campus and community members. It sketches in broad strokes how our main campus and Westside Research Park might develop over the next two decades.</p>
<p>Long-range planning is an inexact science. Our first LRDP, undertaken in 1963, assumed we&#8217;d have 27,500 students by 1990, roughly 9,000 more than we enroll today. It described a campus with 20 residential colleges and 10 professional schools extending across the entire 2,000 acres, from the meadows at the base of campus to the redwoods in the north. We currently have 10 colleges and one professional school, in engineering. But planning efforts of this magnitude are extremely valuable. They force us to ask hard questions about what we have accomplished and what directions the university might take in the future.</p>
<p>The challenging part is to translate the answers to these big questions into a land-use plan, which is what the LRDP is. It designates areas on campus for specific uses, such as housing, academic or recreational areas. It does not green-light growth. It simply details where future infrastructure would go if it is eventually needed and funded. Every future project would need some level of environmental analysis and its own approval before any earth is moved.</p>
<p>These are exciting times for our campus. UCSC joined the&#160;Association of American Universities this past academic year, underscoring the impact and quality of our research and teaching.</p>
<p>Demand for a UCSC education remains at record levels, the diversity in our student ranks is growing, and we are educating an increasing number of first-generation and low-income students. We rank among the top universities in the nation for student social mobility, suggesting we are on track in our mission to provide educational opportunity and access to all Californians. Our responsibility is figuring out how we will educate the next generation while protecting what makes UCSC special. This plan does that, charting an innovative and sustainable course for our campus.</p>
<p>The UCSC of 2040 will be more functional and flexible. Our footprint will remain compact, with new learning, research and housing spaces clustered in our existing academic core. New paths and street designs will make us less car-dependent. Campus natural reserves will be nearly double their current size. And here&#8217;s a key point: We aim to house 100% of new student enrollment over the 19,500 students already planned for under our 2005 land-use plan. That not only lessens housing impacts in the city, but traffic, too. The plan also calls for additional employee housing. And all facilities will be integrated into the landscape, just as campus founders proposed nearly 60 years ago, highlighting our long-standing commitment to respect the campus natural environment.</p>
<p>The draft LRDP and the accompanying draft Environmental Impact Report are available online for review at lrdp.ucsc.edu. We want your feedback. We have created a community handbook that provides a summary of the detailed draft Environmental Impact Report and technical documents. There&#8217;s a frequently asked questions webpage to help people understand the plan. The public comment period for our draft EIR extends to March 8.</p>
<p>This plan is a visual expression of our mission, detailing how we will advance it while stewarding the incredible land on which the university resides. Help us create a clear guide for the next 20 years.</p>

<p>The UC Santa Cruz community can expect to see a number of changes at the Bay Tree Bookstore over the coming months, including a new name and a broader embrace of e-commerce.&#160;A new name for the campus store has yet to be selected.</p>
<p>These changes, scheduled to be rolled out by fall 2021, are driven, in part, by the ever-increasing preference among students and faculty for highly portable digital textbooks, rental textbooks, and other course materials.</p>
<p>For years, textbooks had been the bookstore&#8217;s focus. The upward trend for using digital formats has been mirrored by a steep downward trend in purchases of course materials from the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these changes, it is well-past time for the Bay Tree Bookstore to thoroughly incorporate an e-commerce business model so that it can provide our students, faculty, and staff with top-of-the-line tools and services in support of academic success,&#8221; said Sue Matthews, associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services.</p>
<p>The new campus store will continue to offer all of its existing products including test supplies, office supplies, computers and technology, along with the ever popular UCSC apparel and gift items. Without the need to display and store quantities of hardcopy books, the store is also making plans to reduce its on-campus footprint.</p>
<p>Shifting to an e-commerce business model for course materials requires a technological infrastructure and technical expertise not currently available on our campus. To overcome these hurdles, the store will work with a partner with proven expertise and infrastructure to support the online shopping experience, Matthews said. UC Santa Cruz staff will continue to work in the store with customers.</p>
<p>There are many advantages in enhancing the store&#8217;s digital experience, particularly lower costs for academic materials. It also allows the campus to contemplate the incorporation of mechanisms that can further drive down costs and increase accessibility to course materials.</p>
<p>Inclusive access is a model that was pioneered by UC Davis, and has since been adopted by many colleges and universities nationwide. In this model, all course materials selected by the instructor are made immediately available to students upon enrolling in that course. This means that every single enrolled student is assured access to those materials before their first day of class and at a lower cost than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>The campus will select an online preferred partner, after gathering input from campus stakeholders and thoroughly reviewing its options.</p>
<p>Those who appreciate the experience of reading a physical book can rest assured that all available hard copy forms of course materials&#8211;new, used, and rental&#8211;will still be available from the preferred partner. Additionally, faculty and students who prefer to shop elsewhere will always have the flexibility to do so.</p>
<p>The store will soon be seeking engagement with stakeholders and other representatives from cross-sections of the campus as these changes are further developed and implemented.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also refreshing the express store, which will be managed by the campus dining team to allow the campus store to focus on its core operations. The express store will reopen in fall 2021.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz senior Arcelia Gonzalez Jimenez, who hopes to be a doctor someday, was searching for ways to help with the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic.</p>
<p>When she saw an ad asking for students to help with testing, she jumped at the opportunity. Last summer, she joined the first cohort of students trained to help run the campus&#8217;s asymptomatic testing program.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html">program</a> provides rapid, free, and easy tests for members of the campus community who do not show any symptoms of COVID&#8211;19. The program is helping to reduce the virus&#8217;s spread in the campus community and the surroudning community.</p>
<p>Jimenez provides testing materials&#8212;a swab and vial to collect the sample&#8212; to students, faculty, and staff who then self-administer their tests. She talks through the process and lets them know that they will get results back in two-to-three days.</p>
<p>Jimenez and her co-workers help administer between 200 and 400 tests each day at Crown and Merrill colleges, one of several testing centers on campus.</p>
<p>Students who live on campus are required to get COVID&#8211;19 testing twice a week.</p>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz has announced it will continue with primarly remote instruction this academic year, the campus continues to house students on campus and run dining halls. The health center and some other campus facilities remain open for in-person services.</p>
<p>Jimenez said she was a little nervous at first when she took the testing job because she wondered how it would affect her five roommates. But her fears eased when she learned about all the safety protocols and precautions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There really is very little to worry about in those spaces if you&#8217;re careful,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jimenez and her co-workers change into new masks when they get to work and sanitize their stations regularly. They also have Plexiglas in place separating them from those who need tests. Everyone observes social distancing, staying six feet apart.</p>
<p>While there have been cases of COVID&#8211;19 on campus, she has never tested positive.</p>
<p>Jimenez, who is from Novato, is majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology. She plans to take a gap year or two after graduating this year so she can get more experience in clinical settings or doing lab work before eventually applying to medical school.</p>
<p>Her experience working at testing centers has made her impressed with how efficient and streamlined everything is and made her proud of those who set them up. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had people who work at other testing sites not related to UC Santa Cruz who have come in to check out our testing process,&#8221; she said. The visitors look for tips of how they can improve their own testing sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;That made me appreciate even more the scientists and the workers who work on campus regularly, especially the ones who took the initiative to set all of us up so people can be safe and healthy and do their work or live on campus,&#8221; Jimenez said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0394286807270172c1b96bdf31b987c"><name>faculty-honors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus accepting applications for the 2021-2023 Faculty Director of Honors</title><summary>The Division of Undergraduate Education is undertaking a search for the 2021–23 Faculty Director of Honors.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic-fatigued American public is looking for answers to a long list of burning questions: Is the outlook for the next few months going to be sunny, or bleak? Can we safely visit our aging parents or grandparents after they are vaccinated? Can the vaccines protect us against the troubling new COVID variants that are arising around the globe?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz infectious disease expert A. Marm Kilpatrick explored these pressing issues on February 16 during his second Zoom-based lecture on COVID since July, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/07/marm-kilpatrick-kraw-lecture-covid.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when he called for caution and personal responsibility as ways for communities to protect themselves from the disease.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talk was moderated by Beth Shapiro, UCSC professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kraw Lecture is part of a popular series of science and technology talks made possible by a gift from UC Santa Cruz alumnus George Kraw (Cowell '71, history and Russian literature).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The big, obvious question is, what about the vaccines, and do they protect us against these new variants, and the answer is a qualified &#8216;yes,&#8217;&#8221; said Kilpatrick</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during his presentation, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 vaccines, variants, and more: Our latest understanding of the science of COVID-19, and the road ahead.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That word "qualified" spoke volumes. Kilpatrick emphasized that scientific knowledge on most variants is still limited, and that more of these things keep arising on the scene. Meanwhile, ominous headlines continue popping up on news feeds, including a report about a laboratory study suggesting that COVID&#8217;s South African variant&#8212;which has been detected in the United States&#8212;may reduce protective antibodies brought forth by the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by as much as two-thirds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the same study, referenced in a February 17 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">story, found the vaccine &#8220;was still able to neutralize the virus and there is not yet evidence from trials in people that the variant reduces vaccine protection.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some variants are more transmissible&#8212;and possibly deadlier&#8212;and require higher immunity or more restrictions to avoid them, including mask use and social distancing. But Kilpatrick said he remains confident that vaccines will keep the public safe in spite of the troubling variations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most scientists believe that there's still going to be substantial protection, especially against severe disease,&#8221; said Kilpatrick, speaking of variants in general, and the vaccines currently available in the U.S.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variants were the "wild card" in Kilpatrick&#8217;s presentation, and he laid out the factors that will determine what happens in the next three months, the next sixth months, and more than a year from now.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all depends on whether the population can take sensible measures to protect itself while awaiting vaccination&#8212;and whether those vaccinations can overtake or keep pace with the variants now spreading at a rapid rate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The U.S. must vaccinate people as fast as possible and keep transmission low until we do so with masks and distancing and ventilation," Kilpatrick said. "We still need to know whether the variants can cause severe disease in people that are vaccinated. We don&#8217;t think so, but we don&#8217;t have as good data as we would like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasized that those who have already had COVID-19 should still make sure to get vaccinated, because vaccine-derived immunity appears to be superior to immunity derived from infection.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a quick aside, I know that some people are already making tables of different vaccines and saying, &#8216;Which one should I get? Johnson &amp; Johnson or Moderna or the Pfizer?' So what I want to say, overall, is that all the vaccines that are going to be licensed here in the U.S. and other countries will provide at least some protection and often very high protection against [serious COVID-19 infection], and the ones we&#8217;re considering here have provided substantial protection against all currently known variants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick said socially distancing and masks remain necessary, even after vaccination, because vaccination isn&#8217;t 100% effective in blocking infection, so people who have received the vaccine could become infected and transmit the virus to someone else. In addition, scientists still don&#8217;t have a clear idea of how long vaccination protection against disease lasts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know protection against disease lasts at least two or three months, probably longer,&#8221; he said, but added that it&#8217;s still an open question.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if this was the beginning of the end, and if the next few months would bring relief from the pandemic, edging the nation to some semblance of normalcy, Kilpatrick said that depended, in part, on how fast companies can make and deploy booster vaccines that block infection from new variants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He predicted that all people who want vaccines in the United States will get them within the next six months to a year, greatly reducing severe illness but not stopping all infection. Unfortunately, during the same time period, many developing countries will actually not have access to vaccines, because most of the rich countries will have bought up all the doses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"That's a real challenge, and as a result of that, the virus will continue being transmitted in these countries and we'll get new variants popping up," Kilpatrick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaying a question from the audience, Shapiro asked if it was safe for families&#8212;including non-vaccinated children&#8212;to visit aging parents or grandparents who&#8217;d been vaccinated, especially in cases when families would need to fly to see these relatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a little bit of a tough question,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;Life is all about risk and reward.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vaccinated senior&#8217;s chance of getting &#8220;any sort of symptomatic infection&#8221; is greatly reduced, &#8220;the chances are probably not zero, but it&#8217;s a very low number.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the travelers must take into consideration that the vaccinated senior citizen could infect family members &#8220;by being a carrier but not getting sick themselves." Kilpatrick said the data suggests such an occurrence is &#8220;relatively low,&#8221; but it&#8217;s still worth considering this risk factor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mother has been vaccinated now, " Kilpatrick said. &#8220;She&#8217;s 78, so she&#8217;s in that high-risk category.&#8221; He&#8217;s going to hold off on hanging out with her until he gets vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming infected and transmitting the virus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the safety of reopening schools this spring, Kilpatrick weighed the considerations. For one, there is a very low risk of COVID-19 infection causing severe disease in children. The real risk is to teachers and the possibility that children would bring disease home to unvaccinated parents or grandparents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that data indicate that school reopening in cases where the campuses and resources allow for social distancing and ventilation and include mask-wearing is quite safe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But in some campuses that is not possible, " he said. &#8220;Some buildings have really crappy ventilation and no windows.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, Kilpatrick expressed optimism that the United States would draw closer toward its goal of getting the epidemic under control in the coming months. But it&#8217;s far too early to start celebrating.&#160;</span></p>

A saxophone solo, a drum break, and a sinuous bass line may transport audience members, but these musical flights are also living metaphors of autonomy and resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Porter,&#160; a professor of history, history of consciousness, and critical race and ethnic studies at UC Santa Cruz, has a longstanding fascination with musical improvisation as a creative, generative art form with implications that go far beyond the record turntable or the stage.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The performative aspects of improvisation can be a way of doing different political work, some of which might be called resistance, survival, and promoting one&#8217;s own resiliency in the face of the forces that impact our lives,&#8221; Porter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvisation is a complex art. On the one hand, an accomplished improviser must be a master of technique, discipline, and craft. On the other hand, it requires a certain looseness and an ability to make plenty of room for collaborators in an ever-changing aural landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conversation, in classrooms, and in his published writings, Porter has a passionate, clear, and ingratiating way of breaking down this complex sociopolitical musical concept in a way that engages, entertains, and makes scholars want to delve more deeply into jazz and other forms of improvised music as socially relevant artistic expressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preface to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound Changes: Improvisation and Transcultural Difference,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a forthcoming book from the University of Michigan Press, Porter and the book&#8217;s co-editor, Daniel Fischlin, describe &#8220;the creative risk-taking &#8230;. , movement and momentum that make improvisation an exciting, unpredictable, ubiquitous, and necessary endeavor,&#8221; one that yields self-determination and power in a creative context.</span></p>
<p><strong>A long and winding musical pathway to UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sense, Porter&#8217;s long path to UC Santa Cruz started during his childhood in the East Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jazz was in my house all the time,&#8221; Porter recalled. &#8220;Both of my parents listened to the music and played saxophone. My father was probably a bigger jazz fan than I was. When I was a teenager, I listened to funk, soul, rock, blues, and fusion kind of stuff I found in record bins, but the interest in jazz had already been ingrained.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in history from UC Berkeley before starting his graduate studies at the University of Michigan, where he earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in American studies in 1997. That year, he married Catherine Ram&#237;rez. Both went on to become faculty members at the University of New Mexico before moving on to UC Santa Cruz, where Ram&#237;rez is a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. Porter said he was drawn to the campus &#8220;because it seemed like a really rich place to do my work and have a dialogue with people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter has written or co-edited an impressive array of books exploring improvisation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing for Keeps,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the books he has co-edited with Fischlin, collects 12 essays showing how improvisation provides the means for its participants to address past traumas and ongoing crises while imagining better futures in places ranging from South Africa and Egypt to the United States, Canada, and the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter and Fischlin are also co-editing the forthcoming book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound Changes: Improvisation and Transcultural Difference,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showcasing improvisation in case studies drawn from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Oceania.</span></p>
<p><strong>A tool for change</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter became interested in improvisation and its possibilities nearly three decades ago when he was still in graduate school. In the early to mid-1990s when he was searching for a dissertation topic, jazz was resurgent, with musicians such as Wynton Marsalis reaching large audiences while working to shape the public conversation around jazz and its importance as a cultural tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, when scholars in the emerging field of jazz studies were documenting the meanings circulating around jazz music over the years, Porter became interested in how musicians were theorizing its social significance. His dissertation, a history of Black musicians&#8217; thinking about jazz, became his first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is This Thing Called Jazz? African American Musicians as Artists, Critics, and Activists</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published in 2002 by the University of California Press.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, he has become interested in other forms of improvised music and how they, too, have been seen as potential tools for change. By definition, improvisation requires a deft combination of skill and flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The work [co-editor Daniel Fischlin] has done over the years has focused on interactive aspects of improvisation and how this ability, this sharing, requires you to put parts of your ego aside,&#8221; said Porter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvisers &#8220;need to listen carefully to what others are doing,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They have to be able to engage in a respectful musical dialogue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter had also noticed an intriguing overlap in activism and improvisational prowess. Many of the jazz world&#8217;s finest improvisers are known for their overt political stances, including Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln, whose anthem, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears for Johannesburg,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was part of a body of work exploring oppression and colonialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other prominent Black jazz greats, including Charles Mingus, were outspoken about being underpaid, and often underappreciated musicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He thought jazz musicians were serious artists but was perpetually outraged that they were not treated like serious artists,&#8221; Porter said. &#8220;He was very critical of the conditions in which they labored. He saw a certain legitimacy in playing in serious spaces where people listened to you instead of drinking and socializing."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvisation is a collaborative practice that can build communities, with musicians taking risks while uniting in an artistic goal, Porter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jazz improvisation can be seen as &#8220;resistance&#8221; music because jazz performers created art in the face of prejudice and also because of the political consciousness imbued in the music itself. Last fall, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s feature story called jazz &#8220;protest music &#8230; As it evolved, jazz remained a resistance music precisely because it was the sound of Black Americans building something together, in the face of repression.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But musical improvisers are only human, and there can be lapses of communication, divisions, as well as hierarchies and prejudices that can divide any community, Porter said. After all, human beings are complicated&#8212;and pandemic isolation has introduced another potential obstacle to improvisation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This goes back to the notion of resiliency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has been such a scramble&#8221; for musicians to make a living even before the pandemic, which has pushed many of them to the limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really worried about what comes next, whether musical venues that sustain these artists will survive,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some interesting experiments with interactive programs that let musicians perform &#8216;together&#8217; in real time though they may be thousands of miles apart,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Certainly, there are technologies we can use to sustain this sense of community. But hey, there is nothing like being in the room to have the full sensory experience of improvisation. That is just irreplaceable.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page

A new study published in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20836-3"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Communications</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzed data from UC Santa Cruz and hundreds of other long-term forest monitoring sites across North America to document that climate change is causing declines in seed production for older, larger trees in western forests while increasing seed production for younger, smaller trees in East Coast forests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the West Coast, these reductions in reproductive ability could limit the capacity of forests to bounce back following damages or die-backs from rising temperatures, drought, or pest infestations driven by climate change. However, understanding this trend could help guide forest management practices and improve the modeling of future changes to North American forests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from 48 institutions collaborated on this study, which was led by James S. Clark, Nicholas Distinguished Professor of Environmental Science at Duke University. UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Greg Gilbert, who directs FERP, contributed data for the study and is listed as a coauthor alongside UCSC Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Kai Zhu, who helped prepare FERP data for analysis and interpret modeling results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2007, dozens of students each quarter have participated in FERP internships through the Environmental Studies Department, and it was data collected by these students that made UCSC&#8217;s participation in the new paper possible.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert explained that student interns are responsible for mapping, measuring, and identifying all the trees on the almost 40-acre research plot, which is a part of the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. Interns also monitor a system of mesh baskets called &#8220;phenology traps&#8221; by checking them every two weeks to identify and count the seeds that collect inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can then use those data to estimate changes in the timing of production of flowers and fruits and seeds,&#8221; Gilbert said. &#8220;Or, as in this paper, we can look at estimates of the total amount of seeds being produced.&#8221;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because interns also collect data showing which trees are near each trap, Gilbert said seed production levels can then be related to the size of the trees producing those seeds, which was a crucial component of the recent paper. Seed production initially increases as trees get larger, but it declines once trees grow past a certain size. This contributed to the disparate impacts of climate change on seed production from coast to coast.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">East Coast forests contain many younger, smaller trees, and climate change is fueling their rapid growth, contributing to increased seed production. But on the West Coast, forests contain larger or more mature trees that have already maxed out their seed production, so climate change is more likely to contribute to a decline in their reproductive capacity. These trends held true for local forests in the Santa Cruz area, too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The UC Santa Cruz campus is covered with regrowth forest, as are many of the other forests in the area, and in that sense, they are a little bit more like East Coast forests that are recovering from massive clear-cut,&#8221; Gilbert said. &#8220;But many of our trees, such as the redwoods and the Douglas firs, grow to be very large rather quickly. So the really dominant species in our forests may have a reduction in their contributions to coming generations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert said it&#8217;s hard to know how these changes will play out across forests in our area, but any shifts in forest composition will take place over &#8220;tree generations,&#8221; or many decades. That gives scientists time to learn more and perhaps develop responsive forest management strategies. And Assistant Professor Kai Zhu, who specializes in using data science to study forest resilience and carbon sequestration, said the findings from the new paper will also help scientists to more accurately represent the role of forests in global climate models.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know forests are important because trees store a lot of carbon, but most of our climate models don't currently consider the demographic processes happening in forests,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that trees are living organisms. They can change. They can grow. They can die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a push to study tree mortality in response to climate change, Zhu said the beginning of a tree&#8217;s life had long been a missing piece. Now, the new paper equips scientists with a better understanding of how climate change affects tree reproduction, and life processes within forests can come into sharper focus. Ultimately, Zhu says this result demonstrates the scientific possibility of long-term monitoring sites like FERP and the value of students&#8217; careful seed-counting efforts over the years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This kind of seed data is very hard to get,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;The only way to get this data is you have to have a field site. You cannot observe this through satellites. So these kinds of plots are really valuable, especially to look at biological or ecological processes. It&#8217;s very important work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

conversation with literature professor <strong>Micah Perks</strong>, director of UCSC&#8217;s Creative Writing Program, in a live virtual event on Wednesday, March 3, at 6:30 p.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This free online event follows a month of in-depth programming and community engagement by UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide1"><strong><i>Humanities Institute</i></strong></a></span><span><i> </i></span><span>through its<i> </i><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/deep-read-launch.html"><strong><i>Deep Read</i></strong></a> program. This year, it focused on Orange&#8217;s </span><span><i>New York Times</i></span><span> bestselling novel </span><span><i>There There</i></span><span>&#8212;a multi-generational, fast-paced story about the lives of urban Native Americans in Oakland, CA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>One of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&#8217;s 10 Best Books of the Year, <i>There There</i> was long-listed for the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. It additionally received the Center for Fiction&#8217;s First Novel Prize and the Pen/Hemingway Award.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year&#8217;s <i>Deep Read</i> guest author Margaret Atwood praised the book as &#8220;A gripping deep dive into urban indigenous community in California: an astonishing literary debut!&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <i>Seattle Times</i> described it as &#8220;Bursting with talent and big ideas&#8230;funny and profane and conscious of the violence that runs like a scar through American culture.&#8221; And the <i>New York Times</i> noted that &#8220;<i>There There</i> has so much jangling energy and brings so much news from a distinct corner of American life that it&#8217;s a revelation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Literature professor Micah Perks</strong> said she was looking forward to interviewing Orange and, like everyone else, eager to find out what he has to say.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>If you've read <em>There There</em>, you'll know that it's surprising, and follows a weblike pattern of connections,&#8221; said Perks. &#8220;My hope is that we'll learn more about Tommy Orange's process in writing the book and about his life as a writer and creative political thinker.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I'm a writer and reader, so my questions are mostly about reading and writing this complicated multi-perspective novel, but I've also gotten questions from the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band panel and from colleagues in anthropology, so those will be in there too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Perks described the significance of Orange&#8217;s work and why it has been so popular with readers and critics alike.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It works to explode the cliche of Native Americans as only living on reservations, and of Native culture as being primarily linked to the past, as being gone, done,&#8221; said Perks.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;<em>There There</em> depicts the lives of many different urban, contemporary Native Americans in Oakland right now. The novel is as interested in video games and drones and 3D printing as it is in Pow Wows. And then it's a beautifully written novel with complicated characters and an exciting plot,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past few weeks, Perks has participated in various&#160;aspects of the 2021 Deep Read, and she noted the importance of this type&#160;of program for both students and the wider community.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Jennifer Tseng, my colleague in creative writing and sister fiction writer, and I led a salon on the craft of <i>There There,</i> and I went to other salons as well,&#8221; said Perks. &#8220;I love that our whole UCSC community&#8212;faculty, staff, students, alumni&#8212;can get together around the pleasure of stories and thinking.&#8221;</span></p>

Sandra Faber and alumna and former astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, will discuss their careers in a virtual &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; on Monday, March 8, at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Sullivan, who earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree in Earth sciences at UCSC in 1973 and went on to become the first American woman to walk in space, is an accomplished oceanographer and served as administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under President Obama. As a NASA astronaut, she helped deploy the Hubble Space Telescope and ensure its remarkable longevity and success as an instrument crucial to the research of astronomers such as Faber.</p>
<p>A professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, Faber is known for her pioneering research on the formation, structure, and evolution of galaxies, and for her contributions to the optical design of the Keck Telescopes and other astronomical instruments. She co-led the largest project in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope, a deep imaging survey of distant galaxies.</p>
<p>Both Faber and Sullivan have made wide-ranging contributions to science and received numerous awards and honors in recognition of their accomplishments. And both had formative experiences at UC Santa Cruz, where Sullivan discovered her interest in science as an undergraduate and Faber launched her career as a young faculty member in 1972.</p>
<p>In recognition of their achievements, and with the generous support of a donor, UCSC is naming two floors of the newly renovated Science &amp; Engineering Library in their honor: the Sandra M. Faber Floor (third floor) and the Kathryn D. Sullivan Floor (first floor). Two separate celebrations of these honors will be held in person after COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.</p>
<p>Their conversation on March 8 will be moderated by another groundbreaking UC Santa Cruz scientist, Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>

More details are available at </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614444209171000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdYbtmd9LBgvz1JB7P4fzCvrkjtg" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/<wbr/>fall-2021</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Several principles guide our planning:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will operate in a manner that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of our University community and our Santa Cruz neighbors.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students who may be fully remote should be able to continue making academic progress.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Departments and colleges should work with their instructors, their program faculty, their division, and the academic senate to determine the appropriate mix of remote, on-line, and in-person instruction.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>All plans are subject to change depending on public health guidance and regulations. Statewide and county guidance may place additional limits on our operations.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our planning involves two key local starting points: (1) Classrooms will operate at approximately 50 percent capacity due to distancing and ventilation requirements; (2) On-campus housing will operate at approximately two-thirds occupancy capacity.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Flexibility is critical; our assumptions and starting points could be impacted by a host of factors including the speed of the vaccination rollout across our communities. If there are challenges that delay the rollout, we will need to make adjustments to the mix of instructional modalities, classrooms, and housing capacity.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fall 2021 instruction will include a mix of remote, online, and in-person instruction. Courses that are scheduled now and in the coming weeks as remote for student enrollment will be offered remotely in fall 2021 - due to the complexities of classroom scheduling, there will not be a process for changing remote courses to in-person courses for fall &#8216;21. Those same scheduling complexities dictate that courses desired to have in-person components should be scheduled as in-person now. For scheduled in-person courses, we need to maintain flexibility in regard to classroom capacity modifications or an overall need to shift to remote instruction prior to the start of instruction if health guidance or other factors require changes in plans.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As co-signatories of this memo, the Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), Committee on Courses of Instruction (CCI), and Graduate Council (GC) are delegating authority for approval of remote offering of courses to course sponsoring agencies for fall 2021. Fully online courses continue to require review and approval by CCI. Noting that students may have difficulties meeting some program requirements during the pandemic, CEP, CCI, and GC are also prepared to receive and review in a timely way any requests from department chairs and program directors for temporary modifications of program requirements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. CEP, CCI, and GC will be sending out another letter with a more complete description of resources and processes for the fall soon. This will include guidelines for approving future online synchronous and hybrid courses.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Departments should offer sufficient remote or online course capacity so that students can make progress toward their major or major selection and qualification while remaining remote. Departments are encouraged to ensure that &#8220;packages&#8221; of remote/online courses reflecting standard major qualification pathways are available for first and second year students in their majors, and to communicate these to their prospective majors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Classes with more than 100 students should be planned and scheduled now to be remote or online.</span><span> Courses can have in-person or remote discussion sections, or a mixture of options, conditional on the availability of in-person classrooms. Due to the current planning cap at 50% of classroom capacity, all units on campus are encouraged to be creative in the use of the spaces they control, maximizing the use of available non-General-Assignment spaces such as meeting rooms for instruction, where possible.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Course meetings (primary or secondary sections) should generally be planned for all students to be either in-person or remote/online, rather than using &#8220;mixed delivery&#8221;, with some students in person and some remote at the same time in the same course meeting. Course sponsors can plan separate offerings of a course so that there are both in-person and remote/online options. For small graduate courses, the &#8220;mixed delivery&#8221; method may be easier to implement, and program instructors will retain the flexibility to consider this mode of instruction.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Instructors will have the opportunity to design courses with both asynchronous online material and in-person classroom interaction, to engage each student in multiple modalities. For example, by moving lectures to an online format, in-person sessions could focus on active learning. By having half of the class attend these in-person activities one day per week and half on another day of the week, a larger enrollment could be supported. Departments and instructors will have flexibility in these choices.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please keep in mind the importance of in-person experiences for first year students in support of the transition to college, as well as for second-year students who have not yet had any in-person UC Santa Cruz courses. These could be in-person discussion or secondary lab sections for large courses, or a large course could be offered as two separate sections, one in-person and another remote.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Department and Program Chairs and College Provosts should work with instructors to determine the modalities of their courses. To the extent possible, chairs and provosts should accommodate instructor preferences to teach remotely or online when these modalities are feasible for the achievement of course learning objectives. Divisional Offices can be an important resource in these discussions.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If course sponsors elect to offer in-person secondary discussion sections at 50% capacity, careful consideration should be made that TA duties and responsibilities are consistent with the collective bargaining agreement, including the description of duties form and assigned workload maximum per quarter.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our planning principles underscore flexibility, community well-being, COVID mitigation, and ensuring educational access as we learn to work together in a new environment. Our plans continue to be subject to change due to variable public health regulations. We are committed to transparent communication and the prioritization of health and well-being.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We have provided some of the key points here. For more details, please visit </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614444209171000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdYbtmd9LBgvz1JB7P4fzCvrkjtg" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/<wbr/>fall-2021</span></a><span>.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at UC Santa Cruz are now getting the opportunity to explore an area of study that's never been offered on campus before&#8212;delving deeply into the realms of Black revolutionary history, Black social movements, Black cultural expression, and Black studies as a formation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These topics are part of the campus's new Black studies minor, which launched last fall in response to overwhelming demand from undergraduates across academic divisions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minor is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered through UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Critical Race and Ethnic Studies program (CRES), a major under the Humanities Division.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Xavier Livermon is the first and, at this time, the only UC Santa Cruz faculty member hired to teach in the minor. Last fall, he launched the minor&#8217;s core class, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approaches to Black Studies.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To round out its curriculum, the minor draws from courses from other departments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livermon comes to Santa Cruz from the University of Texas-Austin, where he was an associate professor of African and African diaspora studies. His research exists at the intersection of popular culture, gender, and sexuality in post-apartheid South Africa, encompassing African cultural studies, Black popular music, Black performance, Black queer studies, HIV/AIDS, and African diaspora studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black studies minor is an essential part of &#8220;preparing to be a citizen of the world,&#8221; Livermon said. &#8220;To reimagine the history of the United States without understanding the foundational role of Black people is to misremember history.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In describing the goals of the minor, he referenced The 1619 Project, an ongoing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of the United States national narrative.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary and engaging</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black studies minor has an interdisciplinary approach.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students will be exposed to sociology, geography, the arts, social sciences, education, and anthropology. I hope that students from across the institution will be able to have this minor," Livermon said. "And, ideally, the prospect of a strong Black studies program will have a strong impact on student and faculty retention. That will attract more Black students, more students of color, more students who are interested in questions of social justice and how to remedy anti-Black racism.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of being part of Black studies at UC Santa Cruz was one of the factors that drew him to the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s very exciting to be part of building something from the ground up," Livermon said. &#8220;You don't often get that opportunity. You usually end up inserting yourself into an existing program and make small changes here and there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is an institution that has had a reputation for social and political awareness that hasn't always extended to fields including Black studies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re hoping to remedy that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He visualizes the minor as a necessary intermediate step toward establishing a Black studies major. This major will happen &#8220;if we can stabilize and build out this minor, if we can maintain strong student and faculty interest. It also depends on administrative support.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Hong, an associate professor of literature and the director of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, said the launching of the minor last fall was a long overdue and necessary first step. She noted that there has been a call for Black curriculum dating back to the campus&#8217;s founding in the '60s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to celebrate this, but at the same time it&#8217;s important to note that there is so much more work to do to fortify Black studies on campus,&#8221; Hong said. &#8220;Let us not forget that students have been calling not just for a minor but a Black studies major and potentially even a department. This is a stepping stone toward a larger goal, reflective of intense community organizing."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if the Black studies minor is a concept whose time has come, Hong clarified that the &#8220;time had come" for the program many years ago. Hong noted that a groundswell of support existed for the minor long before the May 25, 2020, police murder of George Floyd that instigated &#8220;a powerful mass movement &#8230;&#160; against the lethality of anti-Black racism.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://cres.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/black-studies-minor.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement published online in the summer of 2020,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hong referenced &#8220;the A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frikan/Black Student Alliance&#8217;s reclamation of Kerr Hall in Spring 2017, which paved the way for the Black Studies minor ... [This] was part of a powerful grassroots arc, stretching back to 1968 when UC Santa Cruz students advocated for the establishment of Malcolm X College (now Oakes College) as a space dedicated to </span><a href="https://history.santacruzpl.org/omeka/items/show/98364#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the study of the 'Black experienc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.' </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also recognize the committed faculty who sacrificed their own research time and the dedicated staff who worked long hours to bring this minor into being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Studies minor offers students grounding in the intellectual histories, political movements, cultural expressions, and critical theories of the Black diaspora, all while engaging a range of methodologies from across disciplines, Hong said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Attention to the significance of social justice is a hallmark of the minor,&#8221; Hong said. &#8220;Supported by faculty expertise in Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific, students can explore the globally multi-sited nature of Black freedom struggles, both past and present, and examine blackness through a comparative lens."</span></p>
<p><strong>Strong interest</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparing the case for the minor, CRES polled undergraduates across campus on their interest in Black studies last spring. Of nearly 200 respondents, 94% agreed or strongly agreed that UCSC would benefit from a Black studies minor, and 85% would be likely or very likely to take Black studies classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong said the survey, if it were held after the murder of Floyd, would have had an even more overwhelming response. She likened the upwelling of protests to &#8220;a moment when the dungeon is shaking and the chains are falling off.&#8221; And she mentioned that the minor was one of the demands made by students who reclaimed Kerr Hall in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Student Union at UC Santa Cruz has described the critical importance of a Black studies minor as a strategic step toward &#8220;an intellectual hub on this campus that focuses on Blackness, Black Lives, and Black Lifeworlds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students pushing for this minor have described, in detail, acts of racism and microaggression they have been subjected to and/or witnessed on campus. Those incidents, in&#160;addition to last year&#8217;s horrific acts of &#8220;anti-Blackness&#8221; racism and violence including the murder of Floyd, underscore the need for this minor, said Adonay Moreno (Kresge '21, CRES major and former president of the Black Student Union.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a very rich area of study,&#8221; said Moreno, who served as the unofficial liaison between the Black Student Union and CRES faculty to launch the minor.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Black students have been fighting for this for many years. I hope it will expand in terms of funding, faculty hires, and curriculum.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A necessary program</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreno also spoke of a lingering demand for a Black studies program &#8220;that will be sustained with the same amount of care, resources, and funding that other majors get on campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students may be interested in the activism of the Black Panthers and other groups, but a Black studies minor also provides a lens for them to delve into the legacies of other movements that are not as well known, including the Combahee River Collective, a Black feminist lesbian social collective that formed in Boston in 1974.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreno said the launching of this minor could improve the campus climate for Black students &#8220;because it will drive more students to apply and get in as well as transfer, so that&#8217;s a major part of it.&#8221; Moreno was drawn to UCSC because of the CRES program as well as the rich history of protest, including the Kerr Hall reclamation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This (minor) is also for students who aren&#8217;t Black, and who genuinely care to learn certain things that have been very harmful to the Black community," Moreno said. "That is not necessarily the purpose of Black studies. It&#8217;s more of an area of Black research and study based on the love and preservation of Black life.&#8221;</span></p>
