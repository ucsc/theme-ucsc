Anyone can take a wide range of remote courses offered across multiple departments. We welcome current students and international students, visitors from other UC campuses, colleges, and high schools as well as community members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote courses range from math to photography, biology to the Start-up Entrepreneurship Academy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and anything students need to get ahead or graduate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extended again this year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Remote instruction makes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Session even more accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing students to continue to make degree progress from anywhere,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Many students appreciate the accelerated five week pace of most summer courses and the fact that everyone pays the same lower in-state per-credit tuition rate.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer options allow ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun.&#160;</span></p>

<p>The SCGSR Program provides supplemental funds for graduate awardees to conduct part of their thesis research at a DOE national laboratory.</p>
<p>Nygren works in the laboratory of Sue Carter, professor of physics, and will use the award to conduct part of his research at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. His research project involves generating hydrogen gas from water as a renewable and carbon-free fuel source for vehicles and electricity generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible to generate hydrogen gas by superheating water in the presence of a catalytic material, and the heat can be provided by concentrated sunlight, making for an entirely carbon-free process,&#8221; Nygren explained. &#8220;At NREL, I will be investigating a promising candidate for the catalytic material, Barium-Cerium/Manganese-Oxide (BCM).&#8221;</p>
<p>SCGSR awardees work on research projects of significant importance to the Office of Science (SC) mission and that address societal challenges at national and international scale. The research projects are expected to advance the graduate awardees&#8217; overall doctoral research and training while providing access to the expertise, resources, and capabilities available at the DOE laboratories. Awardees were selected from a diverse pool of graduate applicants from institutions around the country. Selection was based on merit peer review by external scientific experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever we need to invest in a diverse, talented pipeline of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who can continue this legacy of excellence,&#8221; said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled that these outstanding students will help us tackle mission-critical research at our labs, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what their futures hold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking back, Nick Otis, director of the Office of Emergency Services and campus fire marshal, and Amanda Gullings, campus emergency manager, said they aren&#8217;t sure how they managed everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just did,&#8221; said Gullings. &#8220;We did what was in front of us and we got through it. It was a definite test of mental toughness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s Office of Emergency Services first began monitoring COVID&#8211;19 in January 2020 after reports of the virus started coming out of China. As it became clear that the virus was spreading rapidly, UC Santa Cruz switched in-person classes to remote learning. Gullings turned her focus to getting most faculty, students and staff off campus and protecting the essential workers who needed to stay like custodians, physical plant staff, campus inspectors, and construction workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early days, we thought it would be a short-term blitz,&#8221; Otis said. Nobody ever imagined that the COVID&#8211;19 restrictions would last more than a year.</p>
<p>The Office of Emergency Services staff had to filter through all the orders that were coming from various levels of government, including the country, the state, the county and the University of California system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to make sure whatever we did on campus was consistent with what the Office of the President was recommending and what was allowable in the county,&#8221; Gullings said.</p>
<p>Just as the university was settling into the new normal, a lightning strike in mid-August, set off the CZU wildfire that forced the evacuation of the campus. Some 1,200 residents had to be quickly relocated. This took some effort as not everyone could go to friends or families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotels were completely booked with people displaced and first responders arriving to assist,&#8221; Gullings said.</p>
<p>The university was able to find places for some evacuees in hotels with others going to other locations, including the Cocoanut Grove at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. It was the first time the campus had been evacuated due to a fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other fires impacted other campus locations, including the Mt. Hamilton Observatory (SCU Fire) and Big Creek Reserve in Big Sur (Dolan Fire).</p>
<p>Otis recalls needing to complete a lot of documentation on the fires, give updates to the state fire marshal and do damage assessments. It wasn&#8217;t until mid-September that the evacuation order lifted and students and staff could return.</p>
<p>After that, the focus shifted back to COVID&#8211;19 and making university buildings for the eventual return of in-person classes. Signs had to be put up throughout campus giving the now familiar guidance on mask wearing, handwashing, and distancing.</p>
<p>At the start of 2021, the University of California announced that all 10 campuses would be planning to return to primarily in-person activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;That for me was the moment when I felt I could take a deep breath,&#8221; Gullings said.</p>
<p>While masking and distancing will still remain in place for the foreseeable future, Gullings hopes there will be less restrictions as more people get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Otis said the biggest thing he learned from the last year is how important it is to be flexible when plans change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all had to adjust and adapt to this new working environment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The best thing about the challenges, he said, was that it brought the campus community together.</p>
<p>&#8220;It created a tighter bond, where we were able to work with each other more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a positive thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenges faced by the campus last year were too big for any one single person to solve, Gullings said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we&#8217;ve done has been a collaborative effort with so many different people,&#8220; she said. &#8221;I think the biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned was we&#8217;re so fortunate in higher ed to have a diverse and vast amount of knowledge on campus.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3830e5cb80727017480ce7261718ccaf"><name>pcc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pilipino Cultural Celebration reflects on past, looks to future</title><summary>The Pilipino Cultural Celebration is turning 30, and it’s marking the occasion with a digital play and interview video series featuring Bayanihan alumni. </summary><start-date>1620111600000</start-date><display-name>Pilipino Cultural Celebration reflects on past, looks to future</display-name><path>/2021/05/pcc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/pcc</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1620145399208</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620145662602</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2021/may-04/images/pcc-30-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2021/may-04/images/pcc-30-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pcc-30-500px.jpg</name><display-name>pcc-30-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>169116</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Flier for the May 7 launch of the cultural celebration</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2021/may-04/images/pcc-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2021/may-04/images/pcc-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pcc-80px.jpg</name><display-name>pcc-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14756</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Flier for the May 7 launch of the cultural celebration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The play, titled &#8220;Ano Ang Kwento Ko?&#8221; (&#8220;What is Your Story?&#8221; in Tagalog), follows four friends through the changes in their lives from 2015 to 2025.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Pilipino Cultural Celebration is turning 30, and it&#8217;s marking the occasion with a digital play and interview video series featuring Bayanihan alumni.</p>
<p>The annual celebration is presented by Bayanihan, a UC Santa Cruz organization that promotes understanding of the Filipino and Filipino-American experience.</p>
<p>Because of the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic the event will be entirely online instead of the usual in-person play and collaborative performances held at the UCSC Mainstage Theater. Organizers are working hard to make it as fun and engaging as possible, including holding a release party on the online video-game inspired platform Kumospace.</p>
<p>The theme of the Pilipino Cultural Celebration is &#8220;Legacy,&#8221; and the goal is to honor those involved in the past as well as to inspire those who will come in the future. Kora Fortun, co-chair of the celebration, said she wants current Bayanihan members to think about the legacy they will leave for those who come after them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What work can we do now so people who will be in our shoes a year or five years from now will be able to do even more than we are able to do?&#8221; Fortun said.</p>
<p>The play, titled &#8220;Ano Ang Kwento Ko?&#8221; (&#8220;What is Your Story?&#8221; in Tagalog), follows four friends through the changes in their lives from 2015 to 2025. Profiles of the characters are up on the PCC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pcc.ucsc/">Instagram</a> page: there&#8217;s Kathleen, an art-business major who hates the business side and loves to party; pre-med student Jason who sings in the shower to Disney songs and K-pop; Olivia, a politically aware environmental science student; and David a computer engineering student who is trying to make money to support his two siblings and single mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, we learn who they are and who they become,&#8221; said Anfernee Lai, co-chair of the Pilipino Cultural Celebration.</p>
<p>The play was a group effort of all core members of Bayanihan, with all helping brainstorm the storyline and the scenes.</p>
<p>Lai said it has been a challenge to put together the play because the performers had to film their scenes separately at their homes. Also, the performers don&#8217;t have training in acting. &#8220;There was a lot of retakes,&#8221; Fortun added.</p>
<p>The first act of the play will debut at 7 p.m. on Friday, May 7, at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/475265550231335/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5b%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22invite_link_id%5C%22%3A269636284879609%7D%7D%5d%22%7D">online community release party</a> on Kumospace. Those who join will be able to move around a virtual room with chairs and tables to chat with different groups of people during the first hour, with the play presented at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The remaining acts of the play will be released on May 14 and May 21.</p>
<p>The second part of the Pilipino Cultural Celebration involves the Alumni Project, a series of video interviews with more than 20 alumni, including those who helped with the first PCC in 1991.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite a project with students spending time tracking down alumni and then recording-minute interviews. That footage is then being edited into 10 episodes arranged around different subjects. Each episode is 9&#8211;12 minutes long. &#8220;We want it to be a resource for anybody who might be able to find inspiration infor it,&#8221; Fortun said.</p>
<p>The introduction to the series is up now on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIxaI-DdeM4">PCC YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Fortun and Lai have worked closely coordinating all the preparations for the Pilipino Cultural Celebration, sometimes meeting on Zoom up to four times a day with each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time and work is definitely worth it for the stories we want to tell,&#8221; Fortun said, adding that it is important to preserve a lot of the history and experiences of people in the organization.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="386d028180727017480ce7262ffbb116"><name>manong-generation-oral-history</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preserving the legacy of Watsonville’s first Filipino immigrants</title><summary>In partnership with the university, the community-led Tobera Project will develop an oral history archive and digital exhibition to be housed at McHenry Library. </summary><start-date>1620111600000</start-date><path>/2021/05/manong-generation-oral-history</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/manong-generation-oral-history</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1620149338706</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620150541288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/recio-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/recio-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>recio-400.jpg</name><display-name>recio-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>81576</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Dioscoro R.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz faculty and student researchers from the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts divisions are partnering with leaders of Watsonville&#8217;s Filipino community to document and preserve the rich history of the Manong Generation, the first wave of Filipino immigrants who came to California&#8217;s Central Coast in the 1920s and 1930s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Manong Generation were mostly young, single men who left the Philippines looking for work. In Santa Cruz County, they were recruited into low-wage farm jobs in the Pajaro Valley. They picked strawberries, cucumbers, and tomatoes and sorted beans. They put in 11-hour days hauling irrigation pipes through muddy fields. Though they were paid less than both white and Mexican workers at the time, they still often found a way to send a portion of their wages back to relatives across the Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, women and children were often legally barred from making the journey over from the Philippines because labor recruiters only wanted single men, and racist policies in California also made it largely illegal for Filipino men to marry white women. As a result, there were only about a dozen families with children among the original Manong Generation in the Watsonville area. Most of those children are now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. These days, they are community elders: the last remaining keepers of Manong Generation stories that have otherwise been erased from local history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watsonville-raised Dioscoro &#8220;Roy&#8221; Recio&#8217;s parents were both descendants of the local Manong Generation. His father, Dioscoro R. Recio, died in 2003, and when his mother also passed away in 2018, Recio began to fear that the stories of the area&#8217;s earliest Filipino immigrants could be lost forever. So he hatched a plan to preserve these memories for future generations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a term called &#8216;utang na loob,&#8217; which is kind of like a debt of gratitude, or your responsibility to your ancestors and showing respect and appreciation for what they endured,&#8221; Recio said. &#8220;I wanted to make sure that their stories are honored, because when you look at history books, they're not really recognized as part of the fabric of American society. This is our community, so it's our responsibility to tell these stories.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recio kicked off his efforts with a special event in October of 2019 at the Freedom branch of the Watsonville Public Library. He invited members of the local Filipino community to bring photographs, documents, and artifacts related to their family histories for inclusion in an exhibit at the library called &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.toberaproject.com/toberaproject"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watsonville is in the Heart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven McKay, a UC Santa Cruz associate professor of sociology who studies Filipino labor and migration, stopped by to check out the event and connected with Recio, who shared his vision for a large public archive of Filipino history housed somewhere locally. Those conversations grew into a partnership with the university that was officially announced in April.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a group of UC Santa Cruz researchers supported by </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are helping Recio bring his vision to life through developing an extensive oral history archive, digitizing and expanding the &#8220;Watsonville is in the Heart&#8221; exhibit collection, and planning a K-12 ethnic studies curriculum related to the project. The oral history archive and digital exhibition will eventually join the </span><a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/speccoll"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special collections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the university&#8217;s McHenry Library, where they&#8217;ll be accessible to both the local community and scholars and researchers around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s goal is to document the contributions of the Manong Generation while also shedding new light on the constant threats they faced from racial violence. Recio named the initiative The Tobera Project, in honor of Fermin Tobera, a Filipino American who was murdered during the infamous Watsonville Riots of 1930, when a white mob terrorized the local Filipino community for five days. Tobera was killed when a rioter shot into the side of a bunkhouse where he and other Filipino workers were hiding to protect themselves from the violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These events became an important part of Asian American history and the long legacy of anti-Asian violence and imperialism,&#8221; said Associate Professor Steve McKay. &#8220;But the documentation pretty much lives on in just two local newspaper accounts, so it&#8217;s a very thin documentation. Now, we have the families that descended from the folks who actually experienced it, and for the first time we're hearing their perspective.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKay and Assistant Professor of History Kathleen Gutierrez will lead UCSC&#8217;s work on The Tobera Project with Ph.D. candidates Meleia Simon-Reynolds and Christina Ayson-Plank. Undergraduates Nick Nasser and Toby Baylon will assist with conducting oral history interviews, alongside several trained community volunteers. Gutierrez said she believes the oral history archive will help to build greater understanding of the Manong Generation, including and beyond their experiences of the Watsonville Riots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We're hoping that this archive is going to be much more expansive in showing the diversity of experience in everyday life for Filipinos in Watsonville, including their resilience and the struggles of belonging and othering that were present in the city from the riots onward,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a community-generated effort to allow for more vibrancy to these stories, and I think the community deserves to have that kind of dynamism shown in an archive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those who will contribute stories to the oral history archive is Frank Madolora, a UC Santa Cruz graduate and retired social worker in Santa Cruz County who helped to care for many members of the Manong Generation as they aged, including his father.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the biggest regrets I have is that I didn't talk with my father enough before he passed away because I know he had so many stories,&#8221; Madolora said. &#8220;This project is a way for me to remember him and to let others know about that generation of Filipinos. In our dialect, &#8216;manong&#8217; means brother. They all came here as single males, then they bonded with each other and became each other's families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Recio, that sense of family and legacy are an important part of what he&#8217;s hoping to preserve through The Tobero Project. He chose to work with UC Santa Cruz, in part, to keep the project local and easily accessible for future generations. And already, young people are learning from and connecting with the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example is UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. candidate Meleia Simon-Reynolds, who is mixed Filipino. She said she never learned much about the local Filipino American community while she was growing up in Santa Cruz County. But now, she&#8217;s designing educational resources for The Tobera Project so that local teachers will be better prepared to share this history with students in the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Recio says he hopes The Tobera Project will lift up and validate the voices of local Filipino communities, a mission that feels all the more important in light of recent waves of anti-Asian violence both locally and across the country.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My father and his generation had to endure all of this racist sentiment just to survive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the time when Fermin Tobera was killed, he was just someone who was around who they thought didn&#8217;t belong. But The Tobera Project is saying, &#8216;Hey, we belong here, whether you like it or not.&#8217; And we want to make sure that our ancestors&#8217; stories are recognized as true American stories, just like anyone else&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="38f67db580727017480ce72689dbd2e7"><name>strauss-award-matt-sioson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Strauss Foundation award recognizes student’s work with families affected by incarceration </title><summary>Legal studies undergraduate Matt Sioson recently won $15,000 in funding from the Donald A.

Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation in support of his work sending books to children with incarcerated family members.</p>
<p>Sioson works with <a href="http://www.wallstobridgesproject.org/">Walls to Bridges</a>, an organization founded and operated by UC Santa Cruz students and graduates. He currently serves as director of the Walls to Bridges <a href="http://www.wallstobridgesproject.org/about/">Book Project</a>, leading a team of 15 student volunteers to wrap children&#8217;s books with a nice card, a bow, and stickers. These gifts are then sent to system-impacted children on their birthdays on behalf of an incarcerated family member.</p>
<p>"Most of the incarcerated participants in this project are fathers who send books to their children, but we also serve other family members, like brothers, uncles, and even grandfathers,&#8221; Sioson said. &#8220;What seems like a small gesture of gifting a book can mean the world to a child."</p>
<p>Since the Book Project&#8217;s founding, it has sent more than 1,000 books to 400 children, and it continues to receive requests from across the state.&#160;The Book Project ultimately aims to help families retain a sense of connection while also getting kids interested in reading from an early age.</p>
<p>"I love reading, and I grew up in a Filipino household, which really emphasized the importance of family, so the Book Project has always struck a chord with me and has been a joy to run," Sioson said.</p>
<p>There is no cost to families for participating in the program, and all of the books that children receive are of like-new quality, donated by community members or bookshop partners.</p>
<p>The Book Project&#8217;s work has become increasingly urgent during the pandemic, since visiting rooms across California Prisons have been closed and phone calls home have also been limited. Sioson says the new funding from the Strauss Foundation will help to continue operation of the program and allow him to reach more families.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This project is special because it maximizes positive impact with small actions; this keeps necessary funding low while reaching as many children as possible,&#8221; Sioson said. &#8220;We are always looking for donations to help run the project, and this award will go a long way. My team and I are grateful to the Strauss Foundation for giving us the funding and guidance to continue to support system-impacted families.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The Donald A. Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation, established as a memorial to the late Don Strauss of Newport Beach, awards scholarships to as many as 15 California college sophomores and juniors annually to carry out student-proposed public-service projects in their junior or senior year. Sioson was one of 14 scholars selected this year among recipients recognized for extensive records of community and public service, and a demonstrated desire to &#8220;make a difference.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="390f754680727017480ce726c82684ba"><name>keynote-aapi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Paying tribute to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</title><summary>Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, observed annually in May, creates awareness of, and pays tribute to, the generations of Asians and Pacific Islanders who have enriched America's history and are instrumental to its future success.</summary><start-date>1620111600000</start-date><display-name>Paying tribute to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</display-name><path>/2021/05/keynote-aapi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/keynote-aapi</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1620159984926</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620165568960</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2021/february-16/images/larive-kletzer-250.png</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2021/february-16/images/larive-kletzer-250.png</link><site>news</site><name>larive-kletzer-250.png</name><display-name>larive-kletzer-250.png</display-name><file-size>105075</file-size><width>267</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/campus-aerial-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/campus-aerial-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>campus-aerial-80px.jpg</name><display-name>campus-aerial-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>9994</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aerial photo of campus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, observed annually in May, creates awareness of, and pays tribute to, the generations of Asians and Pacific Islanders who have enriched America&#8217;s history and are instrumental to its future success.

<p>We encourage you to visit our <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/aapi-history-month/index.html">Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month landing page</a> throughout the month as additional stories are posted.</p>
<p>We appreciate having this opportunity to honor and showcase the excellence of our Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander colleagues, students and friends. The history of AAPIs in the United States is not always told in our history books, so it is important for us to document the deep contributions this community has made to our campus and to American society. By highlighting them, we also hope to contribute to the voices challenging the hateful narrative that has taken root in many parts of this country. This violence is not new, and it intersects with the systemic violence that hurts Black, brown and other marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and other months like it, are opportunities for us to denounce hate, to make clear that a diverse, welcoming climate is a top priority for us, and to build coalitions that demonstrate how we can work together to foster an inclusive climate where our differences are valued and all feel that they belong.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3918ef4080727017480ce7267195d784"><name>mine-remediation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Long-term monitoring shows successful restoration of mining-polluted streams</title><summary>Despite differences in aquatic life and toxic metals in streams across a broad region of the western United States, scientists found common responses to cleanup of acid mine drainage.</summary><keywords>David Herbst</keywords><start-date>1620111600000</start-date><display-name>Long-term monitoring shows successful restoration of mining-polluted streams</display-name><path>/2021/05/mine-remediation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/mine-remediation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1620160605980</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620162332260</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/leviathan-yellow-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/leviathan-yellow-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>leviathan-yellow-400.jpg</name><display-name>leviathan-yellow-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>258461</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>polluted stream</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/leviathan-clean-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/leviathan-clean-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>leviathan-clean-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>leviathan-clean-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23142</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>healthy stream</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Leviathan Creek below an abandoned open pit mine, an EPA Superfund site in the Sierra Nevada, where iron oxide deposits coat the stream bottom.

A new study based on long-term monitoring data from four sites in the western United States shows that cleanup efforts can allow affected streams to recover to near natural conditions within 10 to 15 years after the start of abatement work.</p>
<p>The four mining-impacted watersheds&#8212;located in mountain mining regions of California, Colorado, Idaho, and Montana&#8212;were all designated as Superfund sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which helps fund the cleanup of toxic-waste sites in the United States. They are among the few acid mine drainage sites where scientists have conducted extended studies to monitor the effectiveness of the remediation efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news from them all is that Superfund investments can restore the water quality and ecological health of the streams,&#8221; said David Herbst, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of a paper on the new findings to be published in the June issue of <em>Freshwater Science,</em> now <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714575">available online</a>.</p>
<h4>Leviathan</h4>
<p>For the past two decades, Herbst has been monitoring streams affected by acid mine drainage from the Leviathan mine in the central Sierra Nevada. The new study developed out of discussions he had with other scientists involved in long-term studies of similar sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are not many of these long-term studies of impacted watersheds, and by combining our data we could identify the common threads of recovery between these different sites,&#8221; Herbst said.</p>
<p>To assess the recovery of aquatic life in streams and rivers severely polluted by the abandoned mines, the researchers combined data from long-term monitoring over periods of 20 years or more. They used aquatic insects and other diverse invertebrate life (such as flatworms and snails) as indicators of the restoration of ecological health, with nearby unpolluted streams serving as standards for comparison.</p>
<p>Even with differing mixes of toxic metals and different treatment practices used to control the pollution at each site, the studies documented successful recovery to near natural conditions within 10 to 15 years. Much of the recovery was rapid, occurring within the first few years of treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These promising results and shared paths suggest that even daunting environmental problems can be remedied given the effort and investment,&#8221; Herbst said.</p>
<h4>Common responses</h4>
<p>The research also revealed that the sites shared common responses despite differences in the species of aquatic life occurring across this broad geographic region. Shared feeding habits, patterns of development, and behavioral characteristics unified how stream invertebrates responded to the alleviation of metal pollutants.</p>
<p>Species with traits such as feeding on algae, long life cycles, and clinging to the surfaces of stones became increasingly common as toxicity declined over time. Species that were more prevalent when metal concentrations were higher had traits such as rapid development, short life cycles, feeding on deposits of organic matter, and an ability to escape quickly off the bottom by drifting into the flow of water.</p>
<p>The species most sensitive to toxic metals are the mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies. Across all streams, the loss of these sensitive insects occurred at a toxicity level predicted by lab bioassays based on the combined levels of the toxic metals present.</p>
<p>&#8220;The convergence of these responses across streams and at a level consistent with how water quality criteria are established lends support to guidelines established for what chemical conditions are protective of stream and river ecosystems,&#8221; Herbst said.</p>
<p>The additive toxicity of the metals present determined the response to pollutants, he noted, showing that water quality standards should be based on combined metals present rather than singly for each metal. In other words, even if a metal is below its toxic level, when it is present with other metals the combined effect may exceed the tolerance of aquatic life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is vital to account for this factor in how water quality standards for metals are applied,&#8221; Herbst said.</p>

<p>An international team including UC Santa Cruz astrophysicists used observations from NASA&#8217;s Hubble Space Telescope taken two-and-a-half years before the star exploded to identify and study the massive star that became supernova SN2019yvr. The team presented their findings in a paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab838">published May 5 in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>.</p>
<p>The supernova was notable for the absence of a hydrogen signal in its spectrum, making it a rare type Ib supernova, explained coauthor Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;This class has always been intriguing, because the progenitor star has to somehow get rid of its hydrogen,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;This particular star, however, is a little weird for the type of supernova it produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Located 35 million light years from Earth in the Virgo galaxy cluster, the star appeared cool and yellow, with a much larger radius than expected. The typical progenitor for a type Ib supernova would be a hot, blue, compact stellar core stripped of its hydrogen envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen this scenario before,&#8221; said first author Charles Kilpatrick, who led the study as a UCSC postdoctoral researcher and is now at Northwestern University. &#8220;If a star explodes without hydrogen, it should be extremely blue&#8212;really, really hot. It&#8217;s almost impossible for a star to be this cool without having hydrogen in its outer layer. We looked at every single stellar model that could explain a star like this, and every single model requires that the star had hydrogen, which, from its supernova, we know it did not. It stretches what&#8217;s physically possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the years preceding its death, the star might have shed its hydrogen layer or lost it to a nearby companion star, Foley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have different theoretical pathways that can lead to this type of supernova, but in this case nature seems to have been more inventive than we are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still trying to put together a detailed model that can explain all of the observations.&#8221;</p>
<p>SN2019yvr was detected by the Young Supernova Experiment, which uses the Pan-STARSS telescope at Haleakal&#257;, Hawaii, to catch supernovae right after they explode. Foley, who helps lead the survey, said this is one of its first science results. The team was able to precisely determine the position of the supernova in the relatively nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4666, then used the earlier Hubble images to identify which star had exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it exploded, it seemed like a very normal hydrogen-free supernova,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;There was nothing outstanding about this. But the progenitor star didn&#8217;t match what we know about this type of supernova.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several months after the explosion, however, the researchers discovered a clue. As ejecta from the star&#8217;s final explosion traveled through its environment, it collided with a large mass of hydrogen. This led the team to hypothesize that the progenitor star might have expelled the hydrogen within a few years before its death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Astronomers have suspected that stars undergo violent eruptions or death throes in the years before we see supernovae,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;This star&#8217;s discovery provides some of the most direct evidence ever found that stars experience catastrophic eruptions, which cause them to lose mass before an explosion. If the star was having these eruptions, then it likely expelled its hydrogen several decades before it exploded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another possibility is that a less massive companion star might have stripped away hydrogen from the supernova&#8217;s progenitor star. The team, however, will not be able to search for a possible companion star until after the supernova&#8217;s brightness fades, which could take up to 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike it&#8217;s normal behavior right after it exploded, the hydrogen interaction revealed it&#8217;s kind of this oddball supernova,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s exceptional that we were able to find its progenitor star in Hubble data. In four or five years, I think we will be able to learn more about what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers obtained follow-up observations of the supernova using the Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and instruments at the Gemini Observatory, Keck Observatory, and Las Cumbres Observatory.</p>
<p>In addition to Kilpatrick and Foley, the coauthors of the paper include Katie Auchettl, Georgios Dimitriadis, David Jones, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, and C&#233;sar Rojas-Bravo at UC Santa Cruz, as well as researchers at the University of Toronto, University of Melbourne, University of Copenhagen, University of Illinois, and Johns Hopkins University.

Over the next two years, they built a team, attended conferences, hosted outreach events, and launched a grassroots campaign to highlight sustainability and social justice issues.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy. Most people didn&#8217;t know that even a small change in their daily habits, such as opting for a cup of fair-trade coffee, could have global implications. They didn&#8217;t realize that the growers of the coffee, tea, chocolate and other products they consumed might be paid less than a living wage and that child labor may be involved, especially in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. And they weren&#8217;t aware that conventional means of growing coffee and other commodities are often damaging to the environment, harming local ecosystems.</p>
<p>By the time Elphick was a senior, her friends from the campaign &#8212; Saajia Bidar, &#8217;20, and Sof&#237;a Wildvine, &#8217;19 &#8212; had graduated. She&#8217;d moved back home, to El Sobrante, for remote learning, and it would have been easy for all their efforts to fade away during the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic. But she reminded herself there was one big one box left to check: Pass a Fair Trade Resolution through the chancellor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>So, while she was on a hike at the beginning of winter quarter, Elphick was emboldened to email Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. And she answered.</p>
<p>Latham said she was immediately struck by the approach Elphick took with her outreach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ericka was both passionate about the topic and pragmatic about how to implement it on our campus,&#8220; Latham said. &#8221;She had clearly done a lot of homework on the topic, and by the time the proposal made it to campus leadership, it was already a very well-thought-out proposal."</p>
<p>Latham said she supported the values embedded in the proposal and that it was an honor to help to get the resolution finalized and signed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shared the proposal with the key offices across campus that would have responsibility for aligning business practices with the commitment,&#8221; Latham said. &#8220;All units were very supportive and had already implemented several practices that align with the commitment. When I took the proposal to the chancellor, I was able to articulate broad support.&#8221;</p>
<p>On March 12, UC Santa Cruz passed a Fair Trade Resolution that reflects its commitment to join the efforts of the Fair Trade Colleges &amp; Universities, a division of Fair Trade Campaigns, which recognizes towns, colleges, universities, schools, and congregations in the U.S. for embedding fair-trade practices and principles into their social and intellectual foundations and policies.</p>
<p>Simply put, fair-trade practices help protect both workers and natural resources from the exploitation that comes along with the high demand of a capitalist economy. The rigorous standards of fair trade link poverty reduction and environmental conservation, giving consumers confidence that the people behind the products they buy get fair wages for their work and safe working conditions, and that environmentally sustainable production will be practiced.</p>
<p>Here are some of the changes that will bring forth on campus, whenever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair trade coffee, tea, chocolate, and other fair trade products will be available in the dining facilities, at catered meetings and in administrative and faculty offices.</li>
<li>Fair trade food products, apparel and handicrafts (such as jewelry, and other gift items) will be available in the campus store.</li>
<li>The college will support students, staff, and faculty working to increase on-campus awareness of reliably sourced products through events, in curricula, and other efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The proposal is in strong alignment with our campus values of social justice and environmental stewardship,&#8221; Latham pointed out. &#8220;Every unit and campus leader I engaged with to get the resolution finalized is very supportive of the initiative. Our Sustainability Office will take the lead in assessing our progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Elphick prepares to graduate with a degree in psychology, she&#8217;s uncertain about her future career path. But she knows her work in the fair-trade movement will have a lasting and expansive impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair-trade products support workers and natural resources to prevent exploitation,&#8220; she said. &#8221;When supported by a large institution like UC Santa Cruz &#8212; or, even better, the whole UC system &#8212; the purchases of fair-trade products will have a major ripple effect. It&#8217;s very exciting!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="429d1e6980727017480ce7263751d780"><name>consensual-relationships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Interim Conflict of Interest Related to Consensual Relationships</title><summary>In October of last year, the Office of Equity and Equal Protection issued a new policy on conflicts of interest related to consensual relationships under a 6-month interim status.</summary><start-date>1620025200000</start-date><display-name>Interim Conflict of Interest Related to Consensual Relationships (Policy EEP–0001)</display-name><path>/2021/05/consensual-relationships</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/consensual-relationships</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1620320263748</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620320263748</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>In October of last year, the Office of Equity and Equal Protection issued a new policy on conflicts of interest related to consensual relationships under a 6-month interim status. It was extended for six months on March 29, 2021. The policy applies to everyone in the UC Santa Cruz community, including anyone who works, lives, visits, or otherwise engages in university activities, and seeks to clarify expectations and support staff and faculty in avoiding professional conflicts of interest related to consensual relationships.&#160;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This story is part of UC Santa Cruz's vaccination advocacy campaign, </span></i><strong><i>Arm in Arm,</i></strong><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is aimed at communicating to our campus community the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine for a safe reopening of California and UC Santa Cruz.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California now has the lowest rate of COVID-19 infections in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Jose Mercury News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports &#8220;a major surge of hope.&#8221; The state&#8217;s case rate is now less than a third of the United States average. Nonprofit journalism venture CalMatters</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ran a headline hailing California&#8217;s &#8220;stunning COVID reversal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news may be encouraging in the nation&#8217;s most populous state, but UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s COVID experts say this is not the time to slack off when it comes to protecting yourself against the coronavirus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They point to a complex reality that lies beneath the optimistic headlines. Variants are surging, U.S. vaccinations are falling from their peak levels, herd immunity is still a distant goal, and there is no sure-fire way of knowing whether others around us have been vaccinated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Rebecca DuBois, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Marm Kilpatrick, and Associate Professor of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology Susan Carpenter are urging all unvaccinated people to book an appointment to get their shots immediately, and follow CDC safety guidelines even after the vaccinations take effect.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only way society gets to reopen safely is if we are all vaccinated,&#8221; Carpenter said. &#8220;This virus will continue to thrive and mutate if we let it run rampant through communities. The only weapons we have in our arsenal against this virus are to socially distance, wear our masks, and get vaccinated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She likened potential victims of COVID to a water source. Dry up the lake, and watch COVID shrivel up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to remove [COVID&#8217;s] ability to replicate by removing its reservoir,&#8221; Carpenter said. &#8220;The sooner we all get vaccinated, the sooner the virus loses places to grow. We are seeing a rise in variants, and if we are not vigilant and keeping a step ahead of this virus we could end up back at the beginning. We do not want this. Right now our vaccines are working against the variants we see arising. Therefore, we are in an active race against the virus, and the only way for us to emerge victorious is to get vaccinated as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Safety in numbers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mass vaccinations started in the U.S. on December 14, 2020. DuBois pointed out the vaccination rollouts have been going on long enough to show that the vaccines are &#8220;extremely safe and incredibly effective.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There have been over 300 million COVID vaccine doses administered in the USA alone, with over 226 million of those doses being the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;If there were safety concerns in those vaccines, we would have seen them by now. There have been over 8 million doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine administered.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuBois, Carpenter, and Kilkpatrick agreed that the temporary pause on the Johnson &amp; Johnson v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accine was necessary while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed six reports of blood clots among people vaccinated with the J &amp; J shot in the United States.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think people should view this type of scrutiny as a reassuring and positive thing, knowing that any safety concerns at all, even a possible one in a million event, is investigated thoroughly,&#8221; DuBois said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a new report, the CDC said the blood-clot side effect is extremely rare, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old," the CDC wrote. "For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuBois praised the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for its one-dose formulation and its ability to be stored in a refrigerator rather than an ultra-cold freezer like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which will enable its distribution to hard-to-reach individuals or those who lack the ability to schedule two appointments for inoculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all three vaccines now available in the U.S., the protection from COVID-19 greatly outweighs the risks of severe side effects, said Ki</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lpatrick, who emphasized personal safety and economics as compelling reasons to get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Vaccines greatly reduce the chance of getting sick and dying, and also reduce the chance of transmitting the virus to someone else," he said. &#8220;R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">educing transmission in the community is our fastest and best way to restore our society economically and socially.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuBois emphasized civic pride and social responsibility as reasons to get vaccinated, along with a desire for more personal freedom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Getting a vaccine is a great way to show that you care about your community," DuBois said. &#8220;In addition, it is your opportunity to safely start doing your favorite things again. I got my vaccine and got to give my 92-year-old grandma a big hug.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those who have recovered from COVID-19 should get vaccinated, DuBois said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Scientists are generally observing higher levels of antibodies in vaccinated people compared to people who were naturally infected," she said. "So there is still a benefit to getting the vaccine, even if you had COVID in the past."</span></p>
<p><strong>Is herd immunity within reach?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong messaging campaign is essential to achieving herd immunity, Carpenter said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only way we get back to 'normal' is to achieve herd immunity worldwide,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Therefore we need everyone to take the vaccine. The data shows that these vaccines are safe, and we see in Israel where over 50% of the population has been vaccinated just how effective their vaccine campaign has been. In Israel, society is reopened and their case rate is staying very low. This should encourage all those who are hesitant that we can get back to normal if we get vaccinated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in this stage of the pandemic, herd immunity remains an elusive goal, according to scientists and public health officials interviewed for a recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Carpenter agreed that&#160; &#8220;the numbers of people who are refusing to be vaccinated are going to inhibit the United States in getting to herd immunity anytime soon, if ever, as the article states,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it's the unfortunate reality we are facing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very frustrating as the only way the pandemic ends is if we reach herd immunity, so trying to get that message out there is important.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick agreed that human behavior will play a strong role in whether the United States achieves herd immunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The herd immunity threshold, when the fraction of people that are immune is high enough so that each person infects, on average, less than one other person, can definitely be reached by a combination of vaccination and infection, but it's worth noting that the threshold level changes as social patterns change,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;If we stop wearing masks and resume pre-pandemic social behavior then the threshold will be much higher than if we maintain some pandemic measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In some communities, even with pre-pandemic behavior, vaccination may keep immunity above the level needed to prevent the virus from being sustained locally, whereas in others lower vaccination will allow for low to moderate levels of transmission until infection leads to immunity increasing to the threshold in that community,&#8221; Kilpatrick said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common thought among scientists is that we will not reach herd immunity to the point where this virus disappears entirely, DuBois said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if the USA becomes mostly vaccinated, the rest of the world has a long way to go, so the virus will continue to spread globally,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;People should not be holding out hope that the virus will simply disappear&#8212;it will keep coming back into our community and infecting susceptible individuals. However, I do think we will eventually reach a point where the majority of Americans have some level of immunity, preferably via vaccination and not natural infection, and there will be fewer cases of severe disease.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Taking precautions&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three COVID experts agree that people should also take measures to avoid getting infected if they frequently have contact with unvaccinated people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Protection from vaccination&#8212; one dose for J&amp;J or two doses for Pfizer or Moderna&#8212;against symptomatic and severe disease and death is relatively high,&#8221; Kilkpatrick said, noting that the vaccines are&#160; 70&#8211;95% effective against symptomatic disease.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Data is less robust for more severe disease, but protection is likely similar or possibly higher," he said. "But that protection rate is definitely not 100%."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, people should still take measures to avoid becoming infected, and should adjust their own behavior to reflect their specific risk of severe disease and death that increase enormously with age and substantially with preexisting conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick also noted that the vaccines are 60&#8211;90% effective when it comes to reducing the chance of an infected person transmitting COVID to another person. That&#8217;s a very significant amount of protection, but it still leaves room for vigilance, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wearing masks in public is an important way to reduce the chance of becoming infected or transmitting the virus if people are indoors,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. "Outdoors, masks are important if people are having close contact with other people.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Americans have celebrated the recently updated CDC guidelines, listing more activities that vaccinated individuals can safely resume. For example, the agency recently eased face mask guidelines for fully vaccinated people outdoors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But we are not yet at the point where every adult has had the ability to get their full course of a vaccine ,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;Until then, it is still important to wear masks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to encourage the culture of mask wearing until this pandemic is over,&#8221; Carpenter said. &#8220;We do not know who has been vaccinated and who has not. Also remember no one under 16 has been vaccinated yet, and so I think we should be setting an example for our children and continue to wear masks until we know it is safe."</span></p>
<p><strong>Bad information&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the vaccine rollout has been impressive, with around 100 million Americans fully vaccinated, misinformation on vaccines and vaccine safety remain widespread and damaging, the experts agreed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Countering this misinformation is difficult because people often don't seek out other information,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;For example, people who identify as politically conservative are currently less likely to get vaccinated. There are some strategies that appear to be effective in reaching a subset of the population that currently is not choosing to get vaccinated, but it is time-consuming and challenging. This is one of the biggest current challenges in ending the pandemic in the U.S.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter would like to believe that anyone could be persuaded to take the vaccine when presented with the facts. All scientists and medical professionals have a moral responsibility to work against misinformation, listening to people's concerns and providing them with information to help alleviate them, Carpenter said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Engaging at a local level will be important,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are vaccine hesitant, &#8220;it can be helpful for them to know that their friends, family, colleagues, or other trusted individuals received the vaccine," DuBois said. "So spread the word and celebrate when you get your shot."</span></p>

The rapid accumulation of viral genome sequences presents new opportunities for tracing global and local transmission dynamics, but analyzing so much genomic data is challenging.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are now more than a million genome sequences for SARS-CoV-2. No one had anticipated that number when we started sequencing this virus,&#8221; said Russ Corbett-Detig, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The sheer number of coronavirus genome sequences and their rapid accumulation makes it hard to place new sequences on a &#8220;family tree&#8221; showing how they are all related. But Corbett-Detig&#8217;s group at the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> has developed a new method that does this with unprecedented speed. Called Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees (UShER), this powerful tool is described in a paper <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00862-7">published May 10 in <em>Nature Genetics</em></a>.</p>
<p>UShER identifies the relationships between a user&#8217;s newly sequenced viral genomes and all known SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes by adding them to an existing phylogenetic tree, a branching diagram like a family tree that shows how the virus has evolved in different lineages as it accumulates mutations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are able to maintain a comprehensive phylogenetic tree of more than 1.2 million coronavirus sequences and update it with new sequences in real time. No other tool can handle trees of this size with a comparable efficiency,&#8221; said first author Yatish Turakhia, a postdoctoral scholar at the Genomics Institute. &#8220;This helps us keep track of all variants in circulation, including new variants that are emerging.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Genomic contact tracing</h4>
<p>This kind of sequence analysis can be used to discover new strains of the virus as they emerge and track their evolution and transmission dynamics. It can also be used to identify links between individual cases of coronavirus infection and to trace chains of transmission, an approach known as genomic contact tracing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge is to get results soon enough to make meaningful predictions that public health agencies can use to try to control an outbreak,&#8221; said Corbett-Detig, a corresponding author of the paper. &#8220;Our method is orders of magnitude faster than anything else out there, placing new samples in tenths of a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>UShER and related data visualization tools are available to the research community through the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html">UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser</a>, which also provides access to a wide range of data and results from ongoing scientific research on the virus, including new variants that are especially concerning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our browser is the most comprehensive information resource for mutations appearing in the virus and what they mean for our battle against it,&#8221; said coauthor David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Genomics Institute. &#8220;Thanks to Russ&#8217;s team, it includes the world&#8217;s most comprehensive phylogenetic tree of the different lineages of the virus, and that tree continues to grow every week, as fast as new data appear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations as it replicates and spreads. Most of these random variations in the genome sequence have no effect on the behavior of the virus, but researchers can still use them to identify different variants or strains of the virus, see how they are related, and determine if two samples are part of the same transmission chain.</p>
<h4>Variants of concern</h4>
<p>Scientists have identified several important mutations that appear to make the virus more infectious. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 with these mutations are spreading more rapidly than other variants. Coauthor Angie Hinrichs, a UCSC Genome Browser engineer, used UShER to determine that one of these variants, known as B.1.1.7, entered the United States through several independent introductions. It is now the dominant strain in the United States.</p>
<p>Turakhia said he has begun using UShER to study a new variant that has emerged in India and appears to be spreading rapidly there. Known as B.1.617, this lineage of the virus has two mutations of potential concern to scientists. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know yet how concerning it is, but it is important to track it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Viral genomics can reveal transmission chains not found through conventional contact tracing, Corbett-Detig said. This approach can help identify superspreader events, where one person transmitted the virus to many others, and it can also show that two cases from the same location are actually unrelated infections, not part of the same transmission chain, because the viral sequences differ too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an approach that is likely to be valuable moving forward, so we&#8217;re building the tools to enable people to do this in real time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you want to know who transmitted the virus to whom, or where in the world a new sample may have come from, you need to take the samples from your community and project them onto the known phylogenetic tree of all the other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and conventional phylogenetic methods just can&#8217;t do this in a reasonable amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because conventional methods have to recalculate the entire tree every time new sequences are added, which is much too time-consuming when there are hundreds of thousands of sequences. UShER places samples onto an existing global phylogeny almost instantly, and it provides a local subtree of the added samples and their nearest neighbors so that their relationships can be visualized and examined in detail.</p>
<p>The researchers showed that UShER finds the right placement in 97% of cases. In the other 3%, incorrect placements are very close to the true site and still useful for contact tracing. UShER can also be used for quality control to quickly identify and remove low-quality sequences that may contain sequencing errors. The UShER results can be visualized and explored on the <a href="https://nextstrain.org/">Nextstrain</a> platform for interactive visualization of phylogenetic trees and maps of how the virus is spreading.</p>
<p>A training module for UShER is included in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/amd/training/covid-19-gen-epi-toolkit.html">CDC COVID-19 Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit</a> (Module 3.3, including a video, slides, and links to more resources).</p>
<p>In addition to Turakhia, Corbett-Detig, Hinrichs, and Haussler, the coauthors of the paper include Bryan Thornlow and Landen Gozashti at UC Santa Cruz, Nicola De Maio at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and Robert Lanfear at Australian National University, Canberra.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><em><strong><a href="https://barringfreedom.org/exhibitions/music-for-abolition.html">"Music for Abolition"</a></strong></em><span>&#160;is the name of a music video program that three-time Grammy-award winning musician <strong>Terri Lyne Carrington</strong> has curated over the past year for UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Bringing together musicians across a wide variety of genres, it creates a soundtrack to the shared struggle for abolition and resolution in response to the ongoing history of racism and oppression in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>The program is part of the Institute&#8217;s extensive <a href="https://barringfreedom.org"><i><strong>B</strong></i><i><strong>arring</strong></i><i> </i><i><strong>Freedom</strong></i></a><a href="https://barringfreedom.org/exhibitions/sjma.html"><i></i></a>&#160;initiative, which highlights the role of art, music, and visual culture in engaging and confronting issues of prisons, policing, and abolition in this country.</span></p>
<p><span>On Tuesday, May 18, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences will present a <i>Music for Abolition</i> artist panel featuring Carrington, along with a dozen prominent guest musicians, including <strong>Dianne Reeves, Camila Cortina Bello, Nicholas Payton, Lisa Fischer, Orrin Evans, Eric Revis, Nicole Mitchell, Queen Cora Coleman, Maimouna Youssef (Mumu Fresh), Sara Elizabeth Charles, and Cecile McLorin Salvant</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>They will all join together for an online conversation about the role of sound and music in the struggle for abolition. Video clips of their work will also be shown. Admission is free and open to the public with <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_k9rF4UNhTqOSjLWE-pVtug"><strong><i>registration</i></strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Carrington was invited to curate the music program by UCSC feminist studies professor Gina Dent, co-organizer of the "Visualizing Abolition&#8221; event series.&#8220;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;<i>Music for Abolition</i> has been such a gift over these last months, enlivening our speaking events and encouraging us through the pandemic,&#8221; said Dent. &#8220;The amazing group of musicians that Terri has brought together have provided moving sonic explorations of the embodied and painful history and present of prisons and policing. What we hear in these sounds is the ringing-out of abolition--people working collectively together to reimagine a world filled with beauty and freedom, and allowing us to see and to hear the beauty that has always surrounded us and is in us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Carrington worked as a New York session drummer in the mid 1980s before gaining national recognition as the house drummer for both the <i>Arsenio Hall Show</i> and Quincy Jones&#8217; <i>VIBE TV show</i>. In 1989, she released a Grammy-nominated debut CD on Verve Forecast, <i>Real Life Story</i>, and toured extensively with Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock. In 2011, she released the Grammy-award-winning album, <i>The Mosaic Project</i>, featuring a cast of all-star women instrumentalists and vocalists, and in 2013 she released <i>Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue</i>, which also won a Grammy, establishing her as the first woman ever to win in the Best Jazz Instrumental Album category.</span></p>
<p><span>She has performed on over 100 recordings and worked extensively with such artists as Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, Woody Shaw, Clark Terry, Cassandra Wilson, Dianne Reeves, James Moody, and Esperanza Spalding. She is also an honorary doctorate recipient from the Berklee College of Music, and currently serves as founder and artistic director for the Berklee Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Carrington debuted her new band</strong> Social Science in 2019, releasing an eclectic double album, <i>Waiting Game,</i> to confront a wide spectrum of social justice issues&#8212;including mass incarceration, police brutality, homophobia, the genocide of indigenous Americans, and political imprisonment. It featured guests including MC&#8217;s Rapsody, Maimouna Youssef (Mumu Fresh), Kokayi and Raydar Ellis, vocalist Mark Kibble (Take 6), and trumpeter Nicholas Payton, along with spoken word artists Malcolm Jamal-Warner and Meshell Ndegeocello, plus words of resistance drawn from recordings of Angela Davis, Leonard Peltier, Assata Shakur, and Mumia Abu Jamal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8221;It has been a real honor curating the musical contributions for <i>Visualizing Abolition,&#8221;</i> said Carrington. &#8220;It has been an enlightening experience for myself and many of my musical colleagues, and has allowed us to look at these issues through the lens of some incredible artists and scholars. To create music having to do with circumstances, realities, and destinies that I could not yet imagine was not only exciting but also quite expansive, for which I am grateful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>"The symposium brought together an amazing cohort of creators whose work can now reflect each other's in some way or another, sharing messages, ideals, hopes, and dreams,&#8221; she added. &#8220;In recognizing the bonds of our common humanity as artists and cultural workers, we not only strengthen ourselves and our existing communities, we participate in designing the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Terri is an amazing musician and activist, with a commitment to thinking about and advocating for the roles music can play within struggles for social justice,&#8221; said Rachel Nelson, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences. "As Terri has said, for artists and musicians,</span><span>&#160;to create something that&#8217;s transformational or helps point us in the direction of a different&#160;future&#8212;I think that&#8217;s a big part of our roles."</span></p>

The new deadline is May 31, 2021.&#160; This update follows the previously announced review period which was issued to the campus on March 15 and can be <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/uc-policy-review-police-policies-procedures.html">found online</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A summary of the revisions to the Gold Book include:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of Force</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (presently Chapter 8)&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propose changes to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of Force</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy reflect legislative changes to the use of deadly force (Assembly Bill 392), the language required in a use of force policy (Senate Bill 230), additions/clarifications to definitions, and revisions to emphasize de-escalation.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Body Worn Video </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(new)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides a systemwide approach to the use of the body-worn cameras purchased and distributed to the campuses in 2019/2020.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Systemwide Response Teams</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (new)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drafted to create specialized response teams to respond to crowd management situations.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concealed Carry Weapons </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(new)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drafted on the recommendation of the Systemwide Council of Chiefs of Police to adopt a systemwide and consistent policy on the issuance of concealed carry weapons to qualified retired police officers (as required by statute); the policy also specifies that medically retired police officers are not entitled to CCW (pursuant to recent case law).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy text is </span><a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/gold-book-drafts-spring-21.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someday, future historians will read the detailed stories of 22 UC Santa Cruz community members who lived through the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be stories of empty-nest households suddenly refilling with returning children, telecommuting parents, and houses crammed with people getting on each other&#8217;s nerves but figuring out new ways to get along.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be tales of sudden changes to best-laid plans, each of them containing the words &#8220;and then COVID happened.&#8221;&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vivid firsthand accounts of fear, isolation, hopelessness, optimism, and frustration will ring truer than dry passages in an academic history book. They will read the story of Nicole Afolabi (College Nine '21, politics and statistics)&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who thought about how hard it would be to describe the pandemic for future generations. What will it take to show them the scope of this?&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to imagine, honestly, the whole world just shutting down, and you couldn&#8217;t go anywhere, basically,&#8221; said Afolabi.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will read the story of students finding themselves stranded in hometowns where their friends want to go out with them every night and think COVID is a hoax.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively, those accounts will reveal the story of a year like no other, in which a pandemic, the threat of the devastating </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-wildfire-evacuation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZU August Lightning Complex fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the impact of the UC Santa Cruz graduate student labor strike converged, along with a resurgent national conversation about racism, with nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">These stories of resilience and loss are preserved in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empty Year: An Oral History of the Pandemic(s) of 2020 at UC Santa Cruz,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an immersive project that includes a 540-page published book that will be available in mid-May with full-color images by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Sentinel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> photographer Shmuel Thaler and other photographers, and </span><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7f04q435"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an online electronic version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empty Year</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collects</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">oral histories that five UC Santa Cruz undergraduate and graduate student oral historians gathered last year under the guidance of the University Library&#8217;s Regional History Project.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process was emotional for the interviewers as well as the subjects.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While the pandemic can be mapped and tracked and tallied with numbers, for it to be understood and felt for many, if not most people, we need stories,&#8221; wrote Irene Reti (Kresge ' 82, environmental studies; M.A. '04, history), director of the Regional History Project for the UC Santa Cruz University Library, and her co-manager for the project, Cameron Vanderscoff,&#160; in their introduction to the oral history. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empty Year</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for the deep listening of other people&#8217;s accounts to bind and cohere into something more whole.&#8221;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Special Collections received special funding from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Counseling and Psychological Services, which provided the team with a Radical Resilience Grant. The project also received extra funding to pay stipends to the five&#160; students who are doing the interviews.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undertaking such a project in the midst of a deadly pandemic had its logistical challenges. All interviews were done remotely, mostly via Zoom.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of us who were doing this documentation are in the middle of dealing with COVID-19&#8217;s impact on our own lives,&#8217;&#8217; Reti said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a tricky thing. It was very important to not do this work all alone, but as part of a team. It&#8217;s so important to build strong relationships among the student interviewers, and to think of the participants&#8217; psychological health as they do this project.&#8221;</span></h4>
<h4><strong>Student voices&#160;</strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student researchers took turns interviewing each other to brush up on the skills. But those practice interviews were revelatory. Interviews led to so much rich material that some of those sessions ended up in the archives.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the interviewers&#8217; own experiences in the pandemic and their research interests informed their questions. David Duncan, a Ph.D. student in the History Department, chose to interview two other history graduate students and a professor to find out challenges he knew firsthand: &#8220;How to juggle all these different commitments&#8212;grad student, teaching assistant, professor, and human being&#8221; in the midst of a crisis.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duncan also wanted to ask them about the timing of the COVID crisis, during a year full of other challenges. Even before the pandemic hit, &#8220;we were already meeting at [downtown Santa Cruz dining hotspot] Abbott Square Market to work on our MAs because of the COLA strike,&#8221; he said, referring to a graduate student strike and walkout in 2019. &#8220;Also we were just coming out of the rainy season with multiple power outages.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me as an interviewer, I wanted to know how these narrators situated COVID in their own personal timelines of a very eventful 2020,&#8221; Duncan said.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duncan mentioned a &#8220;standout moment&#8221; during his intensive interview with Associate Professor of History Benjamin Breen, who spoke of the ways a pandemic connects us with the past. Confronted with the horrors of COVID, Breen said that he could take some solace in history.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Plague of London, which lasted from 1665 to 1666, for instance, happened in the era of Descartes and Thomas Hobbes and Isaac Newton,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;We think of it as a time of great creativity and innovation. During this time, there has been a lot of talk about how Newton was home from Cambridge University during the epidemic and developed, I believe, his theory of optics.&#8221;&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Breen said it was important to avoid facile comparisons with the past, he feels a strong kinship with past stories of human suffering and how people of those times moved past it and overcame it.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another interviewer, Isabella Crespin (College Nine '22, anthropology and film &amp; digital media double major), found the interviews surprisingly therapeutic.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of the students I interviewed were not living on campus when I spoke with them,&#8217;&#8217; Crespin said. &#8220;I think this project helps students feel like part of a community they have lost. I have also seen students struggle with a loss of independence after they moved back home with their parents.&#8221;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crespin is one of those who moved back home during the pandemic, though it turned out to be an unexpected boon for her.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of my family relationships have never been better, and I am closer with my friends since I have made the commitment to regularly contact them,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><strong>A chance to preserve living history&#160;</strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cameron Vanderscoff (Cowell '11, history and literature&#8212;creative writing), one of the project&#8217;s managers, has a longstanding connection to campus: He&#8217;s a second-generation Banana Slug whose mother, Clare Henjum (Kresge '74, education, environmental studies), and aunt, Peggy Henjum (Rachel Carson '79, environmental studies), went to UCSC in the '70s.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanderscoff, who runs his own oral history practice based in New York City, thinks of oral history as a way of giving the past a speaking voice.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oral history is a radically democratic act,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You'll find that history isn't some stuffy chore of memorizing rote dates and names, as it's too often taught in our schools. Instead, history becomes live, shared in voices that are as powerful as that of any character you find in a novel or on Netflix.&#8221;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to UCSC's experience of COVID-19, &#8220;it's our hope that this archive can do that for our community's experience of this extraordinarily hard time. This collection is a way of passing on a memory of this charged time.&#8221;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he worked on the project, he couldn&#8217;t help but think, with regret, about the lost voices of previous pandemics.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My grandfather, now 99 and the father of two UCSC alumni, was born one year after the end of the Spanish Flu,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've been talking with him about how its shadow still appeared over his childhood. So plague isn't new for humans. In other words: We've been here before.&#160;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But we've failed to keep the memory&#8212;not only of widespread hardship, but also stories of community and resilience and survival,&#8221; Vanderscoff said. &#8220;Our hope is that this project, in its own small way, can keep that memory for whoever is ready to receive it in the future.&#8221;</span></h4>

<p>The test is sensitive enough to detect and identify individual viral antigens one by one in nasal swab samples. This ultrasensitive technique could eventually be developed as a molecular diagnostic tool for point-of-care use. The researchers reported their findings in a paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/20/e2103480118">published May 4 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a chip-based biosensor capable of detecting individual proteins one at a time, and we show how it can be used to detect and identify the antigens for multiple diseases at the same time,&#8221; said senior author Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a whole new way of looking for molecular biomarkers, not only for infectious diseases, but for any protein biomarkers used in medical testing,&#8221; added Schmidt, who holds the Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics and directs the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The current gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections uses PCR technology to amplify small amounts of the virus&#8217;s genomic material, and samples are analyzed in centralized laboratories such as UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://molecular-diagnostics-lab.ucsc.edu/">Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory</a>. Antigen tests, which detect viral proteins, are faster and easier to use and have been approved for testing at the point of care (e.g., doctor&#8217;s offices) and even for at-home use, but these tests are not considered accurate enough for clinical decision-making, and their results may require confirmation with a more reliable technique.</p>
<p>The new chip-based antigen test is not only highly sensitive, but also enables simultaneous testing for multiple viruses from one sample. This is important for diseases such as COVID-19 and flu which have similar symptoms. Measures implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the incidence of flu dramatically, but in the future doctors may need a rapid test that can tell them which respiratory virus a patient is infected with.</p>
<p>Schmidt&#8217;s lab, in collaboration with coauthor Aaron Hawkins&#8217; group at Brigham Young University, has pioneered &#8220;optofluidic chip&#8221; technology for biomedical diagnostics, combining microfluidics (tiny channels for handling liquid samples on a chip) with integrated optics for optical analysis of single molecules.</p>
<p>To develop the new antigen test, Schmidt&#8217;s team designed a fluorescent probe bright enough that individual markers can be detected optically on the chip. &#8220;The ability to detect individual markers means there is no need for an amplification step, which removes some of the complexity of the processing,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Schmidt&#8217;s lab had been developing tests for other infectious diseases when COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic last year. At first, research ground to a halt as a statewide shutdown kept everyone at home. But it was clear to Schmidt that the diagnostic technology his lab was developing for Zika virus and other infectious diseases could be adapted for COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we were allowed to come back to the lab for essential research, my students started coming in to work in the lab by themselves on a coronavirus test,&#8221; Schmidt said. &#8220;It was a heroic effort by my students to develop these tests from scratch. First we were shut down by the pandemic, and then the wildfires hit and we had to evacuate our samples to Stanford and shut down again. But they kept going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graduate student Alexandra Stambaugh led the effort and is first author of the paper. The team worked with the campus diagnostic lab to obtain nasal swab samples for testing. They only used samples that had tested negative for the coronavirus, adding viral antigens to the samples at clinically relevant concentrations to validate the tests.</p>
<p>The test uses an &#8220;antibody sandwich&#8221; approach commonly used for immunoassays. In this case, antibodies specific for the target antigen are attached to magnetic microbeads, so that any target antigen present in the sample sticks to the beads. After washing, a second antibody with the fluorescent marker attached is added, and it binds to any target antigen present on the beads. The fluorescent markers are attached to the antibodies by a spacer that can be cleaved by ultraviolet light, which releases the markers to flow through the detection chip where they are detected one by one. The researchers attached a green marker to the coronavirus antibody and a red marker to the influenza antibody to distinguish between the two viruses.</p>
<p>In addition to Schmidt and Stambaugh, the coauthors of the paper include Joshua Parks , who initiated the development of the novel fluorescent markers, and Gopikrishnan Meena, both at UC Santa Cruz, as well as Matthew Stott and Aaron Hawkins at Brigham Young University. This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="57dc60f980727017480ce726c85813e1"><name>transportation-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Complete the Annual Transportation Survey Today</title><summary>Whether you plan to return to campus in the near future or you're continuing to work or learn remotely, TAPS needs your help.</summary><start-date>1620630000000</start-date><display-name>Complete the Annual Transportation Survey Today</display-name><path>/2021/05/transportation-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/transportation-survey</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1620676731101</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620676731101</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Whether you plan to return to campus in the near future or you're continuing to work or learn remotely, TAPS needs your help!

This annual competition features innovative ways to improve learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s submission is based on interviews with mothers of young Mexican-heritage children and observations of UC Santa Cruz students. It shows how students learn to be community-minded based on their inclusion as contributors in family activities from an early age. The research found that having a greater purpose for learning is important, especially for students for underserved backgrounds. This approach could aid national efforts to broaden children&#8217;s participation in science, engineering, and other academic fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STEM For All Video Showcase competition is open to public voting and comment through May 18th. Prior video submissions from Rogoff&#8217;s team have taken top awards during the past five years of the competition. Assistant Professor of Education Samuel Severance collaborated on this year&#8217;s video, alongside psychology graduate students Gloriana Lopez and Itzel Aceves-Azuara, chemistry graduate student A&#8217;Lester Allen, computational media graduate student Dustin Palea, and ecology and evolutionary biology graduate student Joshua Smith. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62aa294080727017480ce726070e9e3f"><name>virtual-reality-time-compression</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Virtual reality warps your sense of time</title><summary>Psychology research demonstrates the unique "time compression" effect of virtual reality.</summary><start-date>1620802800000</start-date><path>/2021/05/virtual-reality-time-compression</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/virtual-reality-time-compression</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1620857989403</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1620926609148</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/vr-headset-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/vr-headset-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vr-headset-350.jpg</name><display-name>vr-headset-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>46357</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>A person wearing a virtual reality headset with a computer screen in the background</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/vr-headset-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/vr-headset-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vr-headset-80.jpg</name><display-name>vr-headset-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21180</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A person wearing a virtual reality headset with a computer screen in the background</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new study shows how time perception is affected by playing games in virtual reality versus on conventional monitors. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Psychology research demonstrates unique ‘time compression’ effect of virtual reality</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayson Mullen was playing a virtual reality game at a friend&#8217;s house when, suddenly, he noticed that something very strange was happening.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I stopped playing the game, and I realized that I had no idea how much time had passed,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;I was supposed to be taking turns with other people, and I was worried that I had played for too long because I couldn't even guess if it had been 10 minutes or 40 minutes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Mullen was a cognitive science undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, so naturally, this experience piqued his interest. He knew there was existing research showing that video games can cause players to lose track of time, but as a game enthusiast himself, he had never felt anything quite like this. So, with support from Psychology Professor Nicolas Davidenko, he designed an experiment to try to get to the bottom of it. The results are now published in the journal </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/22134468-bja10034"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing &amp; Time Perception</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullen wanted to know how virtual reality&#8217;s effects on a game player&#8217;s sense of time differ from those of conventional monitors, so he designed a maze game that could be played in both formats. Then, Mullen and the research team recruited 41 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students to test the game. Participants played in both conventional and virtual reality formats, with researchers randomizing which version of the game each student started with. Both versions were essentially the same, but the mazes in each varied slightly so that there was no repetition between formats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants were asked to stop playing the game whenever they felt like five minutes had passed. Since there were no clocks available, each person had to make this estimate based on their own perception of the passage of time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior studies of time perception in virtual reality have often asked participants about their experiences after the fact, but in this experiment, the research team wanted to integrate a time-keeping task into the virtual reality experience in order to capture what was happening in the moment. Researchers recorded the actual amount of time that had passed when each participant stopped playing the game, and this revealed a gap between participants&#8217; perception of time and the reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that participants who played the virtual reality version of the game first played for an average of 72.6 seconds longer before feeling that five minutes had passed than students who started on a conventional monitor. In other words, students played for 28.5 percent more time than they realized in virtual reality, compared to conventional formats. This effect, where time goes by faster than you think, is called &#8220;time compression.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<figcaption>Participants in the study played this maze game <br/>both in virtual reality and on conventional monitors. <br/>The superimposed yellow line, which was not shown <br/> to participants, illustrates the path to the goal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time compression was observed only among participants who played the game in virtual reality first. The paper concluded this was because participants based their judgement of time in the second round on whatever initial time estimates they made during the first round, regardless of format. But if the time compression effects observed in the first round are translatable to other types of virtual reality experiences and longer time intervals, it could be a big step forward in understanding how this effect works.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many informal descriptions of time compression in virtual reality from people like Mullen, who have experienced it first-hand, it&#8217;s still an active area of research. One particularly well-known prior study applied virtual reality time compression to shorten the perceived duration of treatment for chemotherapy patients, but that experiment didn&#8217;t compare virtual reality with conventional screen formats.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first time we can really isolate that it's not just that you&#8217;re playing a video game, or the content of whatever you're seeing,&#8221; Mullen said. &#8220;It's really the fact that it is virtual reality versus a conventional screen that contributes to this time compression effect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time compression could be useful in some situations&#8212;like enduring an unpleasant medical treatment or passing the time on a long flight&#8212;but in other circumstances, it could have harmful consequences.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As virtual reality headsets get more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, and as more immersive games are made for this format, I think it would be good to avoid having it become like a virtual casino, where you end up playing more because you don't realize how much time you're spending,&#8221; Mullen said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research on game addiction shows that losing track of time during game play can negatively affect a player&#8217;s sleep cycle and mood. These effects could be more pronounced in virtual reality, but Mullen says game designers can help to minimize the risk, perhaps by integrating a clock that would appear at regular intervals during gameplay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also be important to discover why virtual reality seems to contribute to time compression. In the paper, Mullen describes one possibility, which relates to the fact that, in virtual reality, a player has less body awareness. Psychology Professor Nicolas Davidenko, a coauthor and advisor on the paper, explained why this might be important.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In virtual reality, when you look down, you might see nothing where your body normally would be, or you might see a schematic of a body, but it won't feel like your body,&#8221; Davidenko said. &#8220;There are theories that we may rely on our heartbeat and other bodily rhythms to help our brain track the passage of time, so if you have a less vivid sense of your body in virtual reality, you might be missing the pulses of this timekeeping mechanism.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future experiments to test this theory could yield new insights to help designers maximize benefits and minimize harm from time compression as virtual reality technology continues to grow.&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62aa49dd80727017480ce72620bec285"><name>grande-latino-spirit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Reyna Grande wins Latino Spirit Award for Achievement in Literature &amp; Advocacy</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande (Kresge '99, B.A. creative writing, film &amp; video) has received a 2021 Latino Spirit Award from the California Latino Legislative Caucus.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz new, UCSC news, Latino news, Latino authors, UCSC arts and humanities news, California legislature news, , California Report, literature, literacy, Latino advocacy, women's issues, immigration, first generation college students, UCSC prominent alumni, UC Santa Cruz authors</keywords><start-date>1620860700000</start-date><display-name>Reyna Grande-Latino Spirit Award </display-name><path>/2021/05/grande-latino-spirit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/grande-latino-spirit</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1620857997756</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632863671363</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>hispanic-heritage</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/reyna-grande-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/reyna-grande-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reyna-grande-375.jpg</name><display-name>reyna-grande-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>236621</file-size><width>375</width><height>563</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande (Photo by Ara Arbabzadeh)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/reyna-grande-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/reyna-grande-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reyna-grande-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>reyna-grande-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26394</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande (Photo by Ara Arbabzadeh)</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span><span>UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande (</span></span>Photo by Ara Arbabzadeh)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande (Kresge '99, B.A. creative writing, film &amp; video) has received a 2021 Latino Spirit Award from the California Latino Legislative Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span>Grande joins a diverse group of 10 Latino leaders from throughout California and across various professions who have been selected for the honor this year. She received her award for Achievement in Literature &amp; Advocacy.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The Latino Spirit Awards are about recognizing and honoring the great accomplishments of Latinos across California, who represent the largest population of Latinos anywhere in the country, and across the United States in general,&#8221; noted Latino Caucus Chair Senator Mar&#237;a Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles). </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We are very excited to recognize this year&#8217;s honorees who are at the top of their respective industries&#8212;in broadcasting, in public service, in the arts, and many others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Latinos in California have challenged the frontiers of social, economic, and environmental justice and have strengthened and uplifted our state in countless ways,&#8221; added Latino Caucus Vice-Chair Assemblymember Robert Rivas (D-Hollister). &#8220;I am proud that through the Latino Spirit Awards, our Caucus can recognize and celebrate this year&#8217;s honorees for their outstanding contributions to our state and beyond.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The Latino Spirit Awards were established in 2002 at the State Capitol in Sacramento to highlight positive role models within the diverse Latino community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Many of the honorees are pioneers in their respective fields and have overcome tremendous obstacles, rising to become role models and community leaders.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Grande received an American Book award</strong> in 2007 for her debut novel, <i>Across a Hundred Mountains</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>She wrote the first 80 pages of the novel--a poignant story about immigration and family based on her own personal experience--as part of her senior project in the UCSC Literature Department.</span></p>
<p><span>Her second novel, <i>Dancing with Butterflies,</i> told the story of four women in a Los Angeles-based folklorico group. It received the 2010 International Latino Book Award for<i> &#8220;</i>Best Women&#8217;s Issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2012, Grande released her bestselling memoir, <i>The Distance Between Us</i>, about her life before and after arriving in the United States from Mexico as an undocumented child immigrant. It was described by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as &#8220;a brutally honest book&#8230;the Angela&#8217;s Ashes of the modern Mexican immigrant experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>At the time it was published, the <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i> noted that &#8220;This book would be fabulous required reading for college freshmen&#8212;or even better, for members of Congress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The sequel, <i>A Dream Called Home</i>, was published in 2018. It begins where her last book left off&#8212;at her arrival at UC Santa Cruz, where she began her quest to become the first person in her family to earn a university degree and to become a writer.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/08/reyna-grande-alumna.html</url><title>Alumna Reyna Grande pens NY Times op-ed on immigration</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/grande-second-novel.html</url><title>Award-winning UCSC alumna gaining recognition for second novel</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/04/1141.html</url><title>Alumni Profile: Across a Hundred Mountains</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="67cc13eb80727017480ce7267d017246"><name>accessibility-champion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus announces 2021 Accessibility Champions</title><summary>The Accessibility Champions award program was launched in 2021 to acknowledge faculty who go the extra mile to create inclusive and welcoming learning environments.</summary><start-date>1620802800000</start-date><display-name>Campus announces 20201 Accessibility Champions</display-name><path>/2021/05/accessibility-champion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/accessibility-champion</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1620944098253</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621359102290</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/gaad-poster-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/gaad-poster-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gaad-poster-500px.jpg</name><display-name>gaad-poster-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>210097</file-size><width>500</width><height>666</height></image><image-alt>Poster for Global Accessibility Awareness Day</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping students learn more effectively is at the heart of what we do in higher education. And when it comes to supporting people with accessibility needs, it comes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the heart too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some key groups involved in supporting students with disabilities so they can succeed:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC provides expert support to faculty through our </span><strong>Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CITL), emphasizing the importance of inclusive pedagogy and&#160; universal design for instruction.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Online Education</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensures that online, hybrid, and technology-enhanced courses are designed for accessibility, ease of use, and equity.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ITS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supports students and faculty directly through hardware and software in our classrooms, the libraries, and our campus computer labs.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, of course, the </span><strong>Disability Resource Center</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DRC) is the main stop for students with disabilities seeking accommodations related to instruction.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also many others on campus who support students with disabilities day-in and day-out. And none of this would be possible without the support and funding of campus leadership.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps the most important role of all can be found in the talented individual faculty members who work with students in their courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many years now the Committee on Teaching has honored faculty who excel in instruction. Academic divisions have also honored teaching excellence, such as the Social Sciences Division&#8217;s Golden Apple award. And the Chancellor&#8217;s office has an annual event to present diversity awards that often include contributions by UCSC faculty and staff in the support of accessibility. But there has not yet been an award given to specifically recognize the efforts of faculty. That is, not until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Accessibility Champions award program was launched in 2021 to acknowledge faculty who go the extra mile to create inclusive and welcoming learning environments. The award is sponsored by the Disability Resource Center (DRC) in conjunction with the Accessible Technology Committee (ATC) and staff from the PBSci Testing office. Its timing coincides with Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), which is May 20.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Selection Process</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Accessibility Champion award was designed to be an acknowledgement from students. Students responded to questions about inclusive features of a course they have taken. They noted why they nominated an instructor, including what strategies the instructor employed to make the class more welcoming and accessible. In all, there were 90 nominations received from students, and 82 faculty were mentioned as having made a significant difference in the students&#8217; academic experience. Nine faculty awardees were ultimately selected to receive an award based on the number of nominations received and the insights shared in the student responses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some notable student testimonials from the survey results:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Professor Steven Ritz: &#8220;He uses student-centered language and made time to meet us all in small groups to talk about how we felt going into the class. He talked about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imposter Syndrome</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and told us "You Belong Here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Professor Caitlin Binder: &#8220;She not only provides PDFs of the labs ahead of time but also created audio podcasts so that we could listen along. I found these to be extremely helpful for staying focused. Her organization and color coding has immensely helped me with my visual processing disorder, which has become a serious issue with screen learning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Professor Andrea Steiner: &#8220;She made me feel welcomed and made sure that we met at the beginning of the quarter to talk about my accommodations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Professor Robin Dunkin: &#8220;Exams and tests are very low stakes and don't have time limits. Moreover, there is a 24 hour grace period for all assignments. Overall, the class has really helped me ease my anxiety and stress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, regarding Professor Kristina Chew: &#8220;She has gone above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and ensure I receive all of my DRC accommodation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The 2021 Awardees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delbert Bailey (Computer Science and Engineering)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caitlin Binder (Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry)&#160;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caileen Brison (Chemistry and Biochemistry)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristina Chew (Literature)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robin Dunkin (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracy Larrabee (Computer Science and Engineering)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan McNamara (Sociology)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Ritz (Physics)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Steiner (Community Studies Program)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon learning that they received an Accessibility Champion award, several of the awardees shared their surprise and appreciation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Binder: &#8220;I am beyond grateful for this award and for my students who have shared their experiences with me so that I can be as accommodating as possible.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Brison: &#8220;I'm thrilled that students feel they can succeed in my classrooms and I hope I can continue and grow in providing equitable and progressive classrooms.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor McNamara: &#8220;It's about the most meaningful recognition I can imagine getting. Accessibility is something I care personally and deeply about, and I am truly honored to have been able to enhance my students' sense of belonging and support in this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving out the first ever Accessibility Champion awards has of course also carried great benefit for the donors&#8212;maybe even more than for the awardees. The process of sifting through the survey results and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reflecting on all of the efforts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being made on our campus is truly gratifying. And in a broader sense, consistently giving these awards over time will carry great benefits for UCSC as an organization: These awards help support staff to reframe how we view the whirlwind of operational support, which tends to be predominated by a focus on (often urgent) problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the people who worked on this effort, Rick Gubash, Director of the DRC, and Soma Badri, Accessibility Technology Lead and CUIP intern in ITS, shared a final insight: &#8220;The Accessibility Champion awards are so important because they give other faculty insights into what is going on across the campus. And, it does so in a way that tends to promote positive discussions about helping students to succeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the inaugural year of the Accessibility Champion awards now in the books, we turn our attention to next year and beyond. First and foremost, we need to seek permanent funding for these awards. And, once the pandemic has subsided and we are back to face-to-face interaction, perhaps next year we could arrange an in-person ceremony or luncheon to honor the awardees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Still want to learn more? Take this challenge: </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are the accessibility champions in your department? If you recognize one of this year&#8217;s awardees, thank them.

</ul>
<h4>More in-person campus resources</h4>
<p>Campus resources continue to move toward in-person activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning July 1, both the McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering libraries will allow the campus community in-person access to their print collections and restart on-site in-person services. If you plan to visit the facilities on July 1, first check the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsMMSLAPdWTkog12V8RdKjtDke-A" href="https://library.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University Library website</a> for the latest on hours, service, and safety protocols. Not all librarians and library staff will be immediately transitioning back to on-site, in-person work, so faculty and students needing resources or assistance should continue to use <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYSWxdoK1l1mN9Lgvx4y3M2QDkbg" href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remote Library Services</a> as their first point of library contact.</li>
</ul>
<h4>County heads toward yellow tier &#8212; but not there yet</h4>
<p>What health officials statewide have come to call &#8220;Tier Tuesday&#8221; brought positive news to Santa Cruz County this week. Local COVID case numbers are trending lower, but the data must hold steady for another week to push us across the threshold needed to enter into the least restrictive tier of COVID restrictions, the yellow tier. This status allows for the further easing of restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings, restaurants, places of worship, movie theaters and other businesses. The state&#8217;s tier framework is set to be eliminated and the entire economy reopened June 15, assuming vaccines remain readily available and hospital capacity stays in the normal range.</p>
<p>While the county continues to make progress, please note that all campus COVID protocols and mitigations remain in effect. Our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcry4Le1PtypANbrfjLmOXRhk_og" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Strong campaign</a> details what is expected of those who live on, work at and visit our campus. These protocols and mitigations will be adjusted once we have received updated requirements from the federal Centers for Disease Control, California Department of Public Health and Cal OSHA, especially those applicable to higher education.</p>
<h4>Your Lucky Daye coming soon</h4>
<p>Kick off Memorial Day Weekend with a Friday night concert with friends &#8212; and do it from the comfort of your couch! The latest installment from our Live! From the (Virtual) Quarry concert series is Lucky Daye on Friday, May 28. It&#8217;s brought to you by the Quarry Amphitheater and the Women&#8217;s Center. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quarry.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGakTJ0tB15-ar1cmfSfYL31cPhPw" href="https://quarry.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Register for this free show at the quarry website</a> , and have a wonderful holiday weekend.</p>
<h4>What work will look like as more employees return to campus</h4>
<p>I hope you had a chance to tune in to the Staff Advisory Board Spring Forum last week. Many topics were addressed. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.ibm.com/channel/f9THz4H4RSq&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_nxWrw9nSqtjG75i0TGeWPzfxyg" href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/f9THz4H4RSq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A video of the forum</a> can be found on the SAB website. A topic of interest to many was what work will look like with more people returning to campus &#8212; whether employees will remain remote or return to their workplaces, or if the future might be a hybrid of those options. It&#8217;s impossible to give a blanket response to that question, as work modalities are primarily determined by job requirements and the mission of each office. Some roles can be <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-employees/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFR_BKXYR-OGiBTueMK7qb9YTMb9A" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-employees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accomplished remotely</a> . Others may require in-person work when the campus is primarily in person. Staff Human Resources is developing guidance for supervisors and managers to support staff as we prepare to welcome more employees back to campus for on-site work. Managers are encouraged to begin working with their employees now to discuss options. Those who work in buildings with approved worksite plans may return as soon as June 15. Employees should be working with their supervisors to discuss the staging of their return. All worksite plans will be in place before the start of the fall quarter. If you have any questions about the return to on-site work, please speak with your manager.</p>
<h4>Staff compensation</h4>
<p>Another question on the minds of many was the likelihood of a salary increase for the 2021-22 fiscal year. We expect news about a potential pay increase for policy-covered staff after this week&#8217;s Regents meeting. I can say that funding for an increase has been requested by the UC Office of the President, and I am hopeful this funding will be included in the governor&#8217;s May Budget Revise. We have advocated for this, hope for positive news, and will share updates as soon as they are available.</p>
<h4>Latest information on Accellion breach</h4>
<p>We continue to provide updates about the Accellion data breach as new information becomes available. Many of you have received or will soon receive an email from UC President Michael Drake <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWCP4u1zXlfFJu40--TGiQIWiQdw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sharing an update</a> about the breach and more details about the credit-protection services available. As you know, UC was one of several institutions targeted in a nationwide cyber-attack on Accellion, and many members of our community were affected. Students and employees can find the latest information about this event, a new set of FAQs, and available credit-protection services on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/accellion-notice.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621028471622000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOKtgfKmW_QMgoTwctXeYWZaFPzQ" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/accellion-notice.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Office of the President web page</a> dedicated to the incident.</p>

<p>Delgado, the assistant director of workers compensation, occupational disability and wellness programs in the <a href="https://risk.ucsc.edu">Office of Risk Services</a>, decided to volunteer to do contact tracing. She knew from news reports that there were not near enough people available who knew how to do this vital public health service.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is the process of promptly identifying and notifying people who have been in close contact and potentially exposed to a COVID&#8211;19 infected person. They are informed of what actions to take to prevent further spread of the virus and given resources if needed to help with self-quarantine. The goal is to break the chain of COVID&#8211;19 transmission and prevent further spread of the virus in the community.</p>
<p>Delgado connected with Santa Cruz and Santa Clara county&#8217;s public health departments, where they trained her in the California Department of Public Health contact tracing/case investigation program. She also took Johns Hopkins University&#8217;s contact tracing course, and then started volunteering at Santa Clara County Public Health in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that I was able to assist with the contact tracing effort,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then she had the opportunity to assist in contact tracing with the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center&#8217;s contact tracing program. Delgado conducts contact tracing for employees.</p>
<p>When she is referred to someone who has tested positive for COVID&#8211;19, she starts by calling the person and checking in to find out how they are doing and provides them with self-isolation and resource information. She informs them that she will assist them in recalling with whom they may have had close contact while at work during the timeframe specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Delgado explains that she can then call the close contacts and notify them to self-quarantine as well as provide them with resource and support information. She assures the COVID&#8211;19 positive person that their identity will be kept confidential and not disclosed to any identified close contacts.</p>
<p>Everyone Delgado has called through contact tracing has been extremely helpful, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been really forthcoming,&#8220; Delgado said. &#8221;They have been appreciative that the university has a process in place to keep everybody safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date the <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/">COVID-19 positivity rate on campus</a> has been very low. The contact tracing process has worked well in conjunction with everyday preventive actions to slow the transmission of the virus including physical distancing and wearing a face covering, Delgado said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been amazing to see how the campus community has come together to address the challenges of the pandemic and truly grateful to be part of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Delgado said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6bc6430b80727017480ce72681908a45"><name>kamp</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student-led mentorship program offers holistic support</title><summary>The Kuya-Ate Mentorship Program is a student-initiated retention project targeted to, but not limited to, Pilipino/x students at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>The big brother/big sister program stepped in to help when she needed it most. Peralta was trying to move past a rough winter quarter. She was at her lowest point when her Ate (big sister) pushed her to attend a rehearsal for the annual Pilipino Cultural Celebration.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said, &#8216;I&#8217;m picking you up at your dorm,&#8217;&#8221; Peralta remembers. &#8220;You&#8217;re coming with me.&#8217;&#8221; It was just what Peralta needed to overcome her troubles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://engagingeducation.org/kamp">Kuya-Ate Mentorship Program</a> is a student-initiated retention project targeted to, but not limited to, Pilipino/x students at UC Santa Cruz. In addition to providing mentorship opportunities, KAMP also offers academic and social and cultural support. The goal of the program is to improve retention of all students of color at the university.</p>
<p>It operates under <a href="https://bayanihanucsc.org">Bayanihan</a>, a large organization serving Pilipino/x and Pilipino/x- American students. As well as <a href="https://engagingeducation.org">engaging education</a> (e<sup>2</sup>), which is a student-initiated outreach and retention center for student engagement and academic excellence.</p>
<p>Peralta, now a third-year environmental science student, is one of three coordinators of KAMP this year, along with Ethan Domingo, a second-year computer science major and statistics minor, and Shane Vidal, second-year psychology student.</p>
<p>Peralta&#8217;s positive experience with KAMP has strengthened her resolve to assist students in this very unusual year where most classes are online only.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with COVID, we want to be present for these folks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our work is not going to stop because we&#8217;re online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like most other campus programs, KAMP has shifted its activity online to a Zoom format. It was a challenge but the group made it work. &#8220;It definitely took a lot of thinking and planning,&#8221; said Domingo.</p>
<p>Among online events that have been or will be scheduled are craft sessions and workshops finding off-campus housing and attending graduate school.</p>
<p>For a craft session, KAMP sent yarn and other supplies to students and then told students to log on to Zoom on a certain date so all students could make the bracelets together.</p>
<p>For the workshop on graduate school, KAMP got alumni to share their experiences in post-UC Santa Cruz life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nice knowing there are people who were in the same situation and were able to succeed and go further than graduating undergrad,&#8221; said Vidal, adding that he felt encouraged by hearing the experiences of alumni who have found success in their field.</p>
<p>KAMP matches students with mentors through surveys that students take expressing their interests. The student-mentor pairs are then placed in mini-communities of 15&#8211;20 people called families. This gives students a chance to develop closer relationships in a way that might not be possible in the larger Bayanihan and KAMP organizations, which includes 100&#8211;200 students, Vidal said.</p>
<p>Like Peralta, Vidal had a great experience with his mento, in his case his Kuya (big brother). It was a big transition for him as well to come to college in a completely new environment and to explore different aspects of his identity. He appreciated that he and his Kuya had the shared experience of a Pilipino/x background. &#8220;I had an anchor of who I am that I could fall back on,&#8221; Vidal said.</p>
<p>The students leaders said they look forward to the day when they can all join together in person again. They said there is no replacement for a big group of students meeting together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being with other Pilipino/x who look like you, who have gone through similar experiences&#8212;it&#8217;s an exhilarating and empowering feeling,&#8221; Domingo said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6cf4489f80727017480ce726315e7f13"><name>cdc-mask-guidance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CDC mask guidance and applicability to campus</title><summary>This week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released updated guidance on face coverings.</summary><start-date>1620975600000</start-date><display-name>CDC mask guidance and applicability to campus</display-name><path>/2021/05/cdc-mask-guidance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/cdc-mask-guidance</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1621030619262</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621030619262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="gs">

<p>We extend our gratitude and deep appreciation for the efforts undertaken by all staff and faculty over the past 14 months. You have displayed an incredible work ethic and commitment to the continued success of this university and our students. For that, we are truly grateful, and we are pleased that the Office of the President is proceeding with a general salary increase.</p>
<p>For policy-covered staff, this means a 3 percent increase to their base salary, effective July 1. The adjustment to the academic salary scales will be effective Oct. 1 for policy-covered faculty, July 1 for other policy-covered academic appointees.</p>
<p>Union-represented staff and academic employees are not included in this program, as their wages are governed by collective-bargaining agreements.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7bac2a3080727017480ce7260107a8f3"><name>covid-training</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Employees returning to campus offices must take COVID-19 training</title><summary>COVID-19 Workplace Safety training is required by Cal/OSHA for all employees working in person at UCSC facilities. </summary><start-date>1621234800000</start-date><display-name>Employees returning to campus offices must take COVID-19 training</display-name><path>/2021/05/covid-training</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/covid-training</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1621277551120</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621960755408</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>COVID-19 Workplace Safety training is required by Cal/OSHA for all employees working in person at UCSC facilities.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers found that tropical species are shifting their ranges up mountain slopes at a rate that&#8217;s 2.1 to 2.4 times faster than their temperate counterparts, and tropical forests, in particular, are undergoing these changes 10 times faster than temperate forests. These findings contribute new insight into how species survival outcomes&#8212;and potential conservation strategies&#8212;may vary by geography as our world warms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the research team each brought their own expertise in studying these types of changes within plant and animal communities. Lead author Benjamin Freeman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia, had documented the shifting ranges of birds and other animals in mountainous regions of the tropics. Meanwhile, coauthor Kai Zhu, a UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of environmental studies, had been researching the effects of climate change on North American forests. And coauthor Kenneth Feeley, and associate professor of biology at the University of Miami, had extensively studied the biogeography of tropical forests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With help from UC Santa Cruz environmental studies graduate student and coauthor Yiluan Song, the team set out to combine their insights into a new global perspective. They analyzed data from forest surveys in mountainous regions in North, Central, and South America, as well as worldwide findings from 93 prior studies covering thousands of plant and animal species in mountain environments. Their goal was to get a sense of how species were responding to rising temperatures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change threatens biological diversity across the planet in part because temperature is one of the environmental conditions that defines the geographic range of appropriate habitats for each species. And the rate of warming resulting from human-driven climate change is faster than many plants and animals can adapt. So for some species, migrating to cooler regions may be the best chance for survival.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Basically, species can tolerate these changes through adaptation or acclimation or, alternatively, they can shift their geographic distributions to minimize the climatic changes they experience,&#8221; Kenneth Feeley explained. &#8220;If they fail to do either of these things, then eventually they will suffer and be at risk of extinction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those species seeking colder temperatures on land, there are two main options. Plants and animals can either move great distances in latitude&#8212;away from the equator and toward the poles, where the sun&#8217;s energy is less intense&#8212;or, in mountainous regions, they can make much smaller shifts upward in elevation, where the thinner atmosphere helps to keep things cooler.&#160;</span></p>

<figcaption>Species in temperate mountain regions aren't making the same changes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all species can successfully make these migrations. In fact, prior research by Kai Zhu had shown a &#8220;</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02571.x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failure to migrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; in North American forests, where young trees did not seem to be establishing themselves in cooler habitats farther north. The new paper shows that, in mountain regions, temperate forests are faring slightly better at making smaller upslope migrations. But these shifts still lag far behind the rate of warming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know from observation that we have seen substantial warming already, but what we don&#8217;t see is responsiveness from temperate forest ecosystems,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;So that raises concern.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study says it&#8217;s possible that temperate zone species may have more ability to respond to climate change by shifting the timing of seasonal life processes&#8212;like blooming or shedding leaves for plants and hibernation or seasonal migration for animals&#8212;rather than shifting in space. But it&#8217;s unclear if this strategy will be able to keep pace with changes in the environment as warming continues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, higher rates of migration in the tropics might not necessarily be a good thing either. &#160; Benjamin Freeman&#8217;s prior work had shown that tropical birds are going all-in on the strategy of migrating upslope, and he was concerned to see this same trend in other species within the new paper.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the tropics, these species really are zooming uphill as it gets warmer, and in the short term, that&#8217;s great because it means that they&#8217;re able to respond,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But the problem is that mountains aren&#8217;t infinitely tall. Species can&#8217;t just keep shifting up forever because they&#8217;re going to run into the top of the mountain. It&#8217;s really like they&#8217;re on an escalator to extinction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, as Freeman and his coauthors point out in the paper, that process seems to run much faster in the tropics, despite the fact that the magnitude of recent warming has actually been greater in temperate regions. One theory that might explain these findings is that tropical species may be more sensitive to changes in temperature than their temperate counterparts, perhaps because seasonal variability is limited in the tropics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But regardless of the cause, the paper&#8217;s authors see this trend as a major conservation threat. After all, the tropics are a global hotspot of biological diversity, and tropical mountains, in particular, support the greatest number of species. There are conservation steps that could help tropical mountain species in the near term&#8212;like preserving habitat corridors to aid upslope migration&#8212;but ultimately, the most meaningful action we can take to protect tropical and temperate species alike will be to slow the rate of global warming.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8053e72080727017480ce726ff82f169"><name>horse-genomes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ancient horse DNA reveals gene flow between Eurasian and North American horses</title><summary>New findings show connections between the ancient horse populations in North America, where horses evolved, and Eurasia, where they were domesticated.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro, Alisa Vershinina</keywords><start-date>1621321200000</start-date><display-name>Ancient horse DNA reveals gene flow between Eurasian and North American horses</display-name><path>/2021/05/horse-genomes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/horse-genomes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1621355652865</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621356204251</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/blb-horses-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/blb-horses-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blb-horses-410.jpg</name><display-name>blb-horses-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>196057</file-size><width>410</width><height>328</height></image><image-alt>horse illustration</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/blb-horses-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/blb-horses-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blb-horses-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>blb-horses-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26880</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>horse illustration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Ancient horses crossed over the Bering Land Bridge in both directions between North America and Asia multiple times during the Pleistocene.

<p>The new findings demonstrate the genetic continuity between the horses that died out in North America at the end of the last ice age and the horses that were eventually domesticated in Eurasia and later reintroduced to North America by Europeans. The study has been accepted for publication in the journal <em>Molecular Ecology</em> and is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.15977">currently available online</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of this paper show that DNA flowed readily between Asia and North America during the ice ages, maintaining physical and evolutionary connectivity between horse populations across the Northern Hemisphere,&#8221; said corresponding author Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>The study highlights the importance of the Bering Land Bridge as an ecological corridor for the movement of large animals between the continents during the Pleistocene, when massive ice sheets formed during glacial periods. Dramatically lower sea levels uncovered a vast land area known as Beringia, extending from the Lena River in Russia to the MacKenzie River in Canada, with extensive grasslands supporting populations of horses, mammoths, bison, and other Pleistocene fauna.</p>
<p>Paleontologists have long known that horses evolved and diversified in North America. One lineage of horses, known as the caballine horses (which includes domestic horses) dispersed into Eurasia over the Bering Land Bridge about 1 million years ago, and the Eurasian population then began to diverge genetically from the horses that remained in North America.</p>
<p>The new study shows that after the split, there were at least two periods when horses moved back and forth between the continents and interbred, so that the genomes of North American horses acquired segments of Eurasian DNA and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first comprehensive look at the genetics of ancient horse populations across both continents,&#8221; said first author Alisa Vershinina, a postdoctoral scholar working in Shapiro&#8217;s <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">Paleogenomics Laboratory</a> at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;With data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we were able to see that horses were not only dispersing between the continents, but they were also interbreeding and exchanging genes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA, inherited only from the mother, is useful for studying evolutionary relationships because it accumulates mutations at a steady rate. It is also easier to recover from fossils because it is a small genome and there are many copies in every cell. The nuclear genome carried by the chromosomes, however, is a much richer source of evolutionary information.</p>
<p>The researchers sequenced 78 new mitochondrial genomes from ancient horses found across Eurasia and North America. Combining those with 112 previously published mitochondrial genomes, the researchers reconstructed a phylogenetic tree, a branching diagram showing how all the samples were related. With a location and an approximate date for each genome, they could track the movements of different lineages of ancient horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found Eurasian horse lineages here in North America and vice versa, suggesting cross-continental population movements. With dated mitochondrial genomes we can see when that shift in location happened,&#8221; Vershinina explained.</p>
<p>The analysis showed two periods of dispersal between the continents, both coinciding with periods when the Bering Land Bridge would have been open. In the Middle Pleistocene, shortly after the two lineages diverged, the movement was mostly east to west. A second period in the Late Pleistocene saw movement in both directions, but mostly west to east. Due to limited sampling in some periods, the data may fail to capture other dispersal events, the researchers said.</p>
<p>The team also sequenced two new nuclear genomes from well-preserved horse fossils recovered in Yukon Territory, Canada. These were combined with 7 previously published nuclear genomes, enabling the researchers to quantify the amount of gene flow between the Eurasian and North American populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual view in the past was that horses differentiated into separate species as soon as they were in Asia, but these results show there was continuity between the populations,&#8221; said coauthor Ross MacPhee, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History. &#8220;They were able to interbreed freely, and we see the results of that in the genomes of fossils from either side of the divide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new findings are sure to fuel the ongoing controversy over the management of wild horses in the United States, descendants of domestic horses brought over by Europeans. Many people regard those wild horses as an invasive species, while others consider them to be part of the native fauna of North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horses persisted in North America for a long time, and they occupied an ecological niche here,&#8221; Vershinina said. &#8220;They died out about 11,000 years ago, but that&#8217;s not much time in evolutionary terms. Present-day wild North American horses could be considered reintroduced, rather than invasive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Government of Yukon, said the new findings help reframe the question of why horses disappeared from North America. &#8220;It was a regional population loss rather than an extinction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know why, but it tells us that conditions in North America were dramatically different at the end of the last ice age. If horses hadn&#8217;t crossed over to Asia, we would have lost them all globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>This project was a large international collaborative effort involving researchers at multiple institutions working together to obtain DNA from fossils of ancient horses over a wide range of sites in Eurasia and North America. The coauthors include researchers from the University of Toulouse, France, the Arctic University of Norway, and other institutions in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Russia, and China.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When alumnus George Kraw (Cowell '71, history and Russian literature)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">launched his popular </span><a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/kraw-lecture/2020/#listing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw Lecture Series on Science and Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> four years ago, scientific inquiry was under attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a list of scientific setbacks during the Trump administration, from vanishing online data to the reduced role of scientists in federal policymaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political appointees have shut down government studies, reduced the influence of scientists over regulatory decisions and in some cases pressured researchers not to speak publicly,&#8221; the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a tense and demoralizing period for science, the Kraw Lectures were an impassioned defense for scientific inquiry, in a series that prided itself on open access.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kraw talks, which are sponsored by Kraw, are always free and open to the public, and cover topics ranging from the Antarctic in a time of climate change to the possibility of self-driving cars creating massive future gridlock.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The straightforward and flexible event format, which pairs a leading expert with a timely and intriguing science and tech issue, allows the Kraw to change with the times.&#160;One of the goals of the Kraw lectures is to increase major gifts to UCSC. The lectures have led to fortuitous <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/06/levy.html">meetings, partnerships, and funding opportunities.</a>&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Pandemic pivot</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Kraw started out in an analog, in-person format&#8212;with lectures drawing crowds at UCSC&#8217;s Silicon Valley campus&#8212;it pivoted to an all-virtual webinar-based approach after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also became a recurring subject during the lectures, with UCSC faculty reflecting on the efficacy of vaccines, the threat of variants, and other pressing issues relating to the virus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, attorney George Kraw, who made the lecture series possible with a founding gift to UC Santa Cruz, reflected on the popularity of the science talks that bear his name, as well as the urgent need to continue them into the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Clear and open communication about science and technology is critically important,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;I have been interested in the pernicious effects of political ideology and zealotry on science since my undergraduate days at Cowell College."</span></p>
<p>A summer visit to Moscow between his junior and senior year, spent at the Lenin Institute, increased his resolve to fight against pseudo-science.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Moscow, I learned how the provably false theories of ideologues like the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko led to policies that created disastrous consequences like the 1930s Ukraine famine,&#8221; Kraw said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lysenko was an infamous scientist who was put in charge of Soviet agriculture to disastrous effect. Part of the problem was his denial that genes existed. His methods led to widespread crop failure and mass starvation. He has come to emblemize the pernicious effects of scientific know-nothing-ism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw believes that science communication is one way to counter &#8220;ideological twisting of science, whether the topic is climate change or a global pandemic." And he recognizes the public&#8217;s desire for clear and direct discussion of pressing issues in the science and tech realm.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very happy the lectures have found large followings," he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original goal was to increase the visibility of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s work in science and technology, and was aimed primarily at a Silicon Valley audience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the pandemic created opportunities to reach a global audience through live streaming and the university&#8217;s YouTube channel," Kraw said. &#8220;I am hopeful that we can have live lectures again later this year, but streaming will continue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A sense of urgency and possibility&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Kraw launched the series of science and tech talks with the help of his wife, Rafe Kraw, his key partner in both setting up and continuing the lectures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She helped both organize my original ideas and carry them through," he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brush with mortality also played a strong role. In 2015, Kraw was diagnosed with stage 4 renal cancer and told that the median survival rate for his condition was 16 months, and that the prognosis for survival in the five years following the diagnosis was 8 percent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Six years later, I am still here,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;The doctors are uncertain as to what worked, but something did. My illness gave me some sense of urgency in getting (the lecture series) up and running.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lectures themselves often have a sense of urgency, with topics including &#8220;Forecasting the Future of a Changing Ocean,&#8221; featuring ocean sciences professor Raphe Kudela and Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Kristy Kroeker, or &#8220;Preparing for Future Climate Change: Lessons of the Past,&#8221; with Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor and leading climate researcher James Zachos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Serendipitous connection</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the talks also have an element of discovery, inquiry, and adventure. The inaugural Kraw Lecture, held in March 2017, set its sights on the cosmos. The talk, featuring astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney, posed a fascinating question: How common is the Earth?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lecture focused on the discovery and characterization of rocky planets around other stars. Fortney, one of 15 principal investigators for a new NASA initiative, the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS), which is a quest to find life on planets around other stars, said it was a great honor to give the talk that kicked off the series.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remember it well,&#8221; he said. "That talk was an important springboard for increasing the visibility of UCSC's exoplanet science.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, that talk also led to an unexpected boon for Fortney&#8217;s research. During his talk, Fortney mentioned that he was setting up a brand-new collaborative workshop called the Other Worlds Laboratory for visiting exoplanet scientists at UC Santa Cruz. One of the people in the crowd that night just so happened to work for the Heising-Simons Foundation, which supports the kind of original research that Fortney mentioned. Intrigued by his idea, the foundation ended up funding the project, changing Fortney&#8217;s dream into a project that will continue into the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just goes to show that a single Kraw Lecture can be beneficial to lecturers and audience members alike.&#160;</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Other Worlds Laboratory brings 40&#8211;50 scientists from around the world to campus, for three weeks, to brainstorm new exoplanet projects and collaborations, and foster existing ones,&#8221; Fortney said. &#8220;It has really raised the profile of UCSC in the astronomical community worldwide."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortney said the Kraw Lectures are a good reminder that science and scientific inquiry should be a part of our shared culture in the same way as the arts and humanities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not everyone can be an artist, but we can appreciate art and what it brings to us as humans,&#8221; Fortney said. &#8220;Science touches another part of people's humanity, and I think that sharing it is just as important."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="810e494180727017480ce726e131c64a"><name>vaishnavi-dornadula-baskin-days-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A day to Baskin the glory</title><summary>Student Vaishnavi Dornadula played a leadership role in launching the popular Baskin Day celebration, which invites the community to learn about the achievements of Baskin School of Engineering faculty and students&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before she started designing robots and high-tech "smart jackets" at UC Santa Cruz, Vaishnavi Dornadula (College Nine '21, robotics engineering) loved crafting jewelry and shaping models out of clay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Growing up in Fremont, I was actually really interested in the arts and anything where I could work with my hands and build,&#8221; Dornadula said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first she wasn&#8217;t sure if all this crafting was a private hobby or the pathway to a future career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when she received her acceptance notification from UC Santa Cruz, she, her mother, and a friend decided to explore the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. That chance visit altered her life&#8217;s trajectory, taking her building and problem-solving expertise to a professional level.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, Dornadula and her travel companions wound up at Jack&#8217;s Lounge, a popular gathering place at Baskin, where the Hack-a-Bot robot engineering competition was taking place. The fast-paced contests and the high-spirited, friendly, and competitive atmosphere enthralled her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dornadula was already leaning toward going to UC Santa Cruz, but the passion, speed, and determination of the contestants cemented her decision to become a Slug, and inspired her to study robotics at Baskin. That memory later motivated Dornadula to attempt something she&#8217;d never tried before: build a complex, high-profile Baskin Engineering celebration from scratch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her exciting Hack-a-Bot experience, Dornadula had been looking for ways that she and her engineering cohorts could highlight the achievements of Baskin faculty and students in an inviting, hands-on format that would appeal to the widest possible audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of her brainstorming was the first-ever Baskin Day celebration, which launched in February 2020. Since then, it has turned into a popular campus tradition, with students from across the disciplines, as well as off-campus visitors. This year, during the pandemic, they held an all-virtual version of the event April 9&#8211;11.</span></p>
<p><strong>Full, festive schedule</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baskin Day is an annual event with many moving parts. The celebration includes a career fair, a women in tech panel, a talent show, "shark tank" pitch session, professional Q &amp; A panel, and keynote presentation. Dornadula knew that bringing all of these components together would be a serious undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But this celebration is really important to me because I truly believe it fills a space that needs to be filled,&#8221; Dornadula said. &#8220;Baskin Day was meant to build a bridge between members of the Baskin School of Engineering, the community of UCSC, Santa Cruz community members, and the alumni. It was also to help students through workshops and networking opportunities throughout the event.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Baskin Day is a group effort, it was Dornadula who put together the detailed proposal for a three-day event run entirely by students, and packed with activities, speakers, and workshops that highlight the engineering school&#8217;s achievements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindy Boisvert, programs assistant for student excellence, engagement, and inclusion at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, calls the Baskin Day celebrations a resounding success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The students did a great deal of work creating the event and really worked hard to create a virtual event this year,&#8221; Boisvert said. &#8220;Vaishnavi is tireless. I was surprised when they decided to do the online program this year because most students are adjusting to the online college experience and that is plenty to manage. But Vaishnavi worked hard to make the event engaging and meaningful for students and alumni.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaishnavi&#8217;s Baskin Day collaborators were equally impressed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Given the unprecedented times we are facing, I think an event like Baskin Day is an excellent way for students, alumni, and faculty to get together as a community,&#8221; said Rohan Jhangiani (Stevenson '22, CS game design), who worked alongside Dornadula to help launch the Baskin celebration.&#8220;Working with Vaishnavi is wonderful. She's incredibly charismatic and a great team leader. Baskin Day would not have been possible without her working around the clock to ensure everything was in order and running smoothly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The origins of a Baskin Day dream</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the winter quarter of her first year at UC Santa Cruz, Dornadula became an officer of the UCSC branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). After talking with several administrators in the Baskin School of Engineering, and learning more about events geared to students, she was inspired to launch a Baskin Day event to provide a platform for the hard work of students and faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dornadula hoped this event would bring about a sense of community and pride to the school of engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Baskin Day received an official go-ahead, Dornadula had seven weeks to put the event together&#8212;a very short timeline to launch a celebration from scratch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To launch the planning process, Dornadula recruited a team of 10 students and jumped right in that winter quarter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though it took us some time to get our groove and learn to communicate effectively with each other, it was amazing to see how this room of strangers came together,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dornadula&#8217;s experience as a Baskin student had already given her a crash course in problem-solving on the fly, bringing to life bold new projects, and staring down deadlines.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her time at Baskin, Dornadula has immersed herself in the field of &#8220;soft robotics,&#8221; which involves building robots out of yielding, pliant, flexible materials that are programmed to move like organic lifeforms. One of her first personal projects at UCSC was a literally &#8220;flashy&#8221; LED-enhanced skirt that she programmed to have variations on patterns.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has also taken part in class labs and built a robot that does tasks such as beacon detection with sensors. This year, she is completing a team capstone project in which she and her cohorts hope to build a &#8220;fall injury mitigation smart jacket&#8221; that could lessen the injuries for older adults who stumble and lose their footing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Doubts and challenges</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in spite of her high motivation, experience, and formidable work ethic, she had some moments of doubt before the first Baskin Day events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We struggled a lot that first year with figuring out everything ground up, and not having campus access due to the [graduate student] strikes,&#8221; Dornadula said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The strikes blocking campus caused us to think on our feet and have a smaller version of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the event,&#8221; Dornadula said. &#8220;But we were still able to bring high school students from Santa Cruz County on campus and give them tours of our research labs, hold workshops taught by our esteemed professors, and many other activities. It&#8217;s been really amazing to see how this group of different years and majors has evolved over the past year and a half into a family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pivoting to an all-virtual format brought forth other issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our main challenges this year is trying to figure out how to best engage our audience and try to give them the most we can with this event,&#8221; Dornadula said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall experience has helped Dornadula grow as a leader, teammate, and person.

<p>Called fast radio bursts (FRBs), these extraordinary events generate as much energy in a thousandth of a second as the sun does in a year. Because these transient radio pulses disappear in much less than the blink of an eye, researchers have had a hard time tracking down where they come from, much less determining what kind of objects are causing them. Therefore, most of the time, astronomers don&#8217;t know exactly where to look.</p>
<p>Locating where these blasts are coming from and, in particular, what galaxies they originate from is important in determining what kinds of astronomical events trigger such intense flashes of energy. In the new study, accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11617">available online</a>, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to study eight FRBs, helping to narrow the list of possible FRB sources.</p>
<h4>Flash in the night</h4>
<p>The first FRB was discovered in archived data recorded by the Parkes radio observatory on July 24, 2001. Since then astronomers have uncovered up to 1,000 FRBs, but they have only been able to associate roughly 15 of them to particular galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results are new and exciting. This is the first high-resolution view of a population of FRBs, and Hubble reveals that five of them are localized near or on a galaxy's spiral arms,&#8221; said lead author Alexandra Mannings, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Most of the galaxies are massive, relatively young, and still forming stars. The imaging allows us to get a better idea of the overall host-galaxy properties, such as its mass and star-formation rate, as well as probe what's happening right at the FRB position because Hubble has such great resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, added, &#8220;We are increasingly optimistic that by dissecting the locations which transmit FRBs we will fully resolve the mystery of their origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the new study, astronomers not only pinned all of the FRBs to host galaxies, but they also identified the properties of the types of locations they originated from. Hubble observed one of the FRB locations in 2017 and the other seven in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don't know what causes FRBs, so it's really important to use context when we have it,&#8221; said coauthor Wen-fai Fong of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. &#8220;This technique has worked very well for identifying the progenitors of other types of transients, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The galaxies in the study existed billions of years ago, so astronomers are seeing the light from them as they were at about half of the current age of the universe.</p>
<p>Many of them are as massive as our Milky Way. The observations were made in ultraviolet and near-infrared light with Hubble&#8217;s Wide Field Camera 3. Ultraviolet light traces the glow of young stars strung along a spiral galaxy's winding arms. The researchers used the near-infrared images to calculate the galaxies&#8217; mass and find where older populations of stars reside.</p>
<h4>Location, location, location</h4>
<p>The images display a diversity of spiral-arm structure, from tightly wound to more diffuse, revealing how the stars are distributed along these prominent features. A galaxy&#8217;s spiral arms trace the distribution of young, massive stars. However, the Hubble images reveal that the FRBs found near the spiral arms do not come from the very brightest regions, which blaze with the light from hefty stars. The images help support a picture that the FRBs likely do not originate from the youngest, most massive stars.</p>
<p>These clues helped the researchers rule out some of the possible types of stellar objects thought to cause these brilliant flares, including the explosive deaths of the youngest, most massive stars, which generate gamma-ray bursts and some types of supernovae. Another unlikely source is the merger of neutron stars, the crushed cores of stars that end their lives in supernova explosions. These mergers take billions of years to occur and are usually found far from the spiral arms of older galaxies that are no longer forming stars.</p>
<h4>Magnetic monsters</h4>
<p>The team&#8217;s results are, however, consistent with the leading model that FRBs originate from young magnetar outbursts. Magnetars are a type of neutron star with powerful magnetic fields. They&#8217;re called the strongest magnets in the universe, possessing a magnetic field that is 10 trillion times more powerful than a refrigerator door magnet. Astronomers last year linked observations of an FRB spotted in our Milky Way galaxy with a region where a known magnetar resides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Owing to their strong magnetic fields, magnetars are quite unpredictable,&#8221; Fong explained. &#8220;In this case, the FRBs are thought to come from flares from a young magnetar. Massive stars go through stellar evolution and become neutron stars, some of which can be strongly magnetized, leading to flares and magnetic processes on their surfaces, which can emit radio light. Our study fits in with that picture and rules out either very young or very old progenitors for FRBs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The observations also helped the researchers strengthen the association of FRBs with massive, star-forming galaxies. Previous ground-based observations of some possible FRB host galaxies did not as clearly detect underlying structure, such as spiral arms, in many of them. Astronomers, therefore, could not rule out the possibility that FRBs originate from a dwarf galaxy hiding underneath a massive one. In the new study, careful image processing and analysis of the images allowed researchers to rule out underlying dwarf galaxies, according to coauthor Sunil Simha, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Although the Hubble results are exciting, the researchers say they need more observations to develop a more definitive picture of these enigmatic flashes and better pinpoint their source.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to discover and pinpoint another 100 events in the next few years to greatly advance this research,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

An award-winning film scholar and filmmaker, Shimizu&#8217;s work focuses on race, sexuality and representations in global popular culture, and she is a prominent voice nationally on those issues. Shimizu will take up the post on July 1.</p>
<p>Shimizu joins us from San Francisco State University, where she is a Professor of Cinema and Director of the School of Cinema, a position she has held since 2019. Previously she served as the university&#8217;s Associate Director of the School of Cinema.</p>
<p>In her administrative roles, she has experience in resource management, faculty development, student curriculum, and equity and diversity. In her leadership of SFSU&#8217;s School of Cinema, she has been attentive to establishing effective communications that enable the building of a collaborative community. In resource management, she has overseen building renovations and the establishment of student scholarships. A commitment to equity, inclusion and access has been a major component of her leadership. Since 2014, Shimizu has participated in Ford Foundation and National Academies panels to review fellowships designed to diversify the professoriate. Her programming as SFSU&#8217;s Director of the School of Cinema focused on Women of Color Filmmakers in 2019 and on Race, Rebellion and Resistance in 2020, featuring prominent alumni and guests from the industry and the academy. Her deep engagement with the challenging and enriching issues of diversity and equity in higher education will be an asset to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Before joining SFSU, Shimizu was Professor of Asian American, Film and Media, and Feminist Studies at UC Santa Barbara, where she served as chair of the Senior Women&#8217;s Council. She received her Ph.D. in Modern Thought and Literature from Stanford University; her M.F.A. in Production and Directing from UCLA School of Theatre, Film and Television; and her B.A. in Ethnic Studies from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Shimizu is the author of three books, co-editor of two anthologies and director of two feature films. Her latest work, the documentary film &#8220;The Celine Archive,&#8221; is screening now at film festivals in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the search committee for its hard work, collaboration, and partnership. Participation in the public sessions was strong, and the feedback was extraordinarily helpful. Please join me in congratulating Dr. Shimizu and welcoming her to our campus community.

A newly launched endowment celebrates his influence.
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The celebrated UC Santa Cruz oceanography professor Gary Griggs made a vow this spring, and he plans to stick with it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am going to be the last guy standing at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; he declared with equal parts bluster and self-deprecating humor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs, 77, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, is well aware of the fact that most faculty members who have taught for more than half a century, as he has, have the word "emeritus" or "emerita" hanging off the end of their titles. At this point, only one other active faculty member, a professor in the English Department, has been on campus longer than he has.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Griggs has found renewed vigor and boldness in his longevity on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t feel old.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding Chancellor Dean McHenry in 1968, he still gets &#8220;such a big rush&#8221; from stepping into the classroom. In fact, he&#8217;s so averse to retirement that he has little patience for words that have retirement connotations, such as &#8220;influence&#8221; or &#8220;future legacy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is my 53rd year of teaching," he said with a laugh. &#8220;I know some people who cannot wait for retirement. My father was a high school teacher who got so burned out, he retired at 55. But I don&#8217;t see any reason to step down until you are really ready for it. Many people are, and they stand around the coffee shop hoping someone will talk to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And lately, some of those who have benefited from his mentorship are trying to find ways to honor him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That desire to celebrate his influence, and benefit future generations of scientists, lies at the heart of the newly launched </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXHkJfiniXlaZhp0gTj06IqIwEE537F-/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Griggs Endowment for Student Research Support in Earth Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supports high-impact research and professional development for undergraduates and graduates in Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><strong>At heart, a teacher and mentor&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he has no plans to step down, Griggs has been in a reflective mode lately, expressing gratitude for everyone who has taken his classes, read his influential oceanography-themed columns in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Sentinel,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or attended his community lectures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs has much to celebrate about his career, including many awards, dozens of graduate students, and hundreds of scientific articles. He&#8217;s known for groundbreaking research on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coastal zone and development, through shoreline processes, coastal hazards, coastal engineering, and sea-level rise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments hit him up constantly for advice about the viability and impacts of breakwaters, seawalls and jetties, and coastal policies to reduce the devastating impact of upward-creeping sea levels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among his key achievements are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnerships with the U.S. Geological Survey and the NOAA Fisheries Santa Cruz laboratory, and leading the successful campaign to build the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, the popular visitors center and hands-on aquarium. The Seymour Center opened on March 11, 2000, and receives 70,000 visitors a year, including many schoolchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his time as a teacher and a mentor are the accomplishments he values above all others. His youngest scholars are barely out of their teens, but he&#8217;s also in contact with alumni who are in their 70s.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think one of the times it hit me was probably 20 years ago now when a student came up to me after a big oceanography class and said, 'My mom and dad took your class,' and five or six years ago when a young woman said, &#8216;My grandma took your class."&#8217;</span></p>
<p><strong>An astronaut praises him to the moon</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs gets constant reminders of his influence. He&#8217;ll receive emails out of the blue, and can&#8217;t even walk into a doctor&#8217;s office without someone recognizing and remembering him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the highest-profile recent shoutouts came from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">astronaut and oceanographer Kathryn Sullivan (Cowell &#8217;73, Earth sciences) during her recent informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita of Astronomy and Astrophysics Sandra Faber, an event that also publicized the naming of two interactive, high-tech floors in the newly renovated Science &amp; Engineering Library in their honor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the spotlight was on Sullivan and Faber, Sullivan&#8212;the first American woman to walk in space and later the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&#8212;devoted several minutes of her talk to gushing about Griggs and his oversized influence on her life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To me [Griggs's mentorship is] really symbolic of the commitment to reaching out, supporting and educating students at UC Santa Cruz," she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan met Griggs at a pivotal moment in her time at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was not quite 18 years old, and still a declared language major when I worked up the courage to go up to Gary after class one day, and I didn&#8217;t put any of this very intelligently," Sullivan said. "I essentially said, 'I&#8217;ve taken a very interesting marine biology course with [founding faculty member and celebrated biology professor] Todd Newberry. I am loving this stuff, and I don&#8217;t even quite really know why. So I don&#8217;t know if I just found my lifetime hobby, or something more.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she remembers it, Griggs was not the least bit put off by her rambling query. Instead, he responded to the energy and far-ranging curiosity behind the questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I asked him, &#8216;What does it mean to be an oceanographer, besides lecturing to freshmen?&#8217;" Sullivan recalled. &#8220;But instead of dissing me, as he could very well have done, he heard what was underneath it. He responded to the interest, invited me up to his lab the following Saturday, and spent three quarters of a day fielding my questions, one after the other.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, in a nutshell, where most professors would have looked down their noses at my ignorant questions and reminded me how huge the chasm was between us, Gary built a bridge across that gulf.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Idealism and activism</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs takes great pride in Sullivan&#8217;s lavish praise of his work with her during her UC Santa Cruz years.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A student like Kathryn Sullivan will come along maybe once or twice in your career,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But reaching out to students and finding common cause with them has always come naturally to him, even during his early years on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs arrived at UC Santa Cruz as a 25-year-old professor&#8212;just a few years older than his 19- and 20-year-old students&#8212;after earning his Ph.D. at Oregon State University in a whirlwind of three years. He has vivid stories of teaching to a packed room at Thimann Lecture Hall, having never taught a college class. He entered the room and faced &#8220;a huge throng of 260 people. Some of the students brought their dogs to class. The room smelled of patchouli oil. I was kind of overwhelmed! It was a hippie enclave. I actually had a coat and tie on at that point.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the class wrapped up, &#8220;I was kind of humbled," he said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;You know, thanks for taking this class, I really enjoyed it,' and they all stood up and clapped.&#8221;&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his early classes was all about local environmental problems&#8212;and led to Griggs&#8217; taking some strong public stances.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, a development of 10,000 homes had been proposed for the Wilder Ranch property, which Griggs strongly opposed. The project was later scrapped. In 1970, Griggs also voiced his opposition to a planned large nuclear power plant on a coastal terrace just north of Davenport. His class&#8212;along with a citizen&#8217;s group called CEDAR (the Committee to Examine the Dangers of Atomic Reactors)&#8212;carefully examined claims that the plant would be safe, clean, and efficient. Like the Wilder Ranch subdivision, the reactor was never built.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, Griggs doesn&#8217;t think twice about making potentially controversial statements about problems that are, in the long term, unresolvable, and are being dealt with in temporary "Band-Aid" approaches, such as landslides and coastal erosion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My writing now is probably a lot bolder than it was all those years ago when I had to worry about getting tenure," he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, he gets many interview requests in which people ask him &#8220;what can be done" about the Rat Creek landslide, a constant threat to those who live on or wish to travel through California&#8217;s Big Sur coast.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They ask me, 'Well, how do you fix the Big Sur highway problem,'" he said. &#8220;I say, &#8216;Well, you don&#8217;t fix it.' In short, any 'solution' will be a Band-Aid. This is what you call a wicked problem, meaning there&#8217;s no solution.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And we&#8217;re at the point where cities across the planet will have to deal with this kind of issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials, in various parts of the world, have thrown around terms such as "managed retreat" or "managed relocation" to keep coastal communities viable and safe in the face of unstable geology and coastal erosion as well as sea-level rise. The trouble is, he said, there is no blueprint for such relocation. How would it work? What would it cost? What are the logistics of such a massive project?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When all has been said and done, much more has been said than done,&#8221; Griggs said.</span></p>
<p><strong>'An incredible sense of accomplishment'&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Griggs can only do so much to solve the world&#8217;s environmental problems, he can at least take pride in how much he&#8217;s transformed the oceanography infrastructure at UC Santa Cruz. Promoted to full professor in 1979, he served as chair of the Earth Sciences Department from 1981 to 1984 and associate dean of natural sciences from 1991 to 1994.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While leaving a m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ark with his teaching and research, he also played a decisive role in guiding the development of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Coastal Science Campus, which is now a bustling science hub, a far cry from what it looked like back in 1991 when Griggs assumed the directorship of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) back when the marine lab campus was a few trailers huddled on dusty land bordering fields of Brussels sprouts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more impressively, the campus, which includes a lavish amount of classroom and laboratory space, was built almost entirely from non-university funds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he&#8217;s on the Coastal Science Campus, he has &#8220;an incredible sense of accomplishment" and is grateful to the many community partners who supported the project including alumna and Monterey Bay Aquarium founder and executive director Julie Packard (Crown &#8217;74, B.A. biology; M.A. &#8217;78)&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That project is just part of a long-term philosophy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every day, I want to have accomplished something, push something a little bit forward," he said. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t like to do nothing. At any one time I have two books I&#8217;m working on, I&#8217;m preparing a lecture, and I&#8217;m advising five or six graduate students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Griggs continues to expand his reach well beyond the confines of campus. In addition to his campus responsibilities, he often speaks to audiences as varied as high school students, Rotary Club members, and the residents of retirement communities. It&#8217;s all part of his strong public outreach for science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, he feels &#8220;a certain obligation" to speak to any audience that will have him, &#8220;because it&#8217;s giving back to the community. We&#8217;re paid by the state of California.&#8221; On the other hand, he gets a lot of satisfaction from interacting with different audiences and giving media interviews. A lot of that springs from his energetic and positive attitude.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve won the genetic lottery&#8221; in terms of mood and outlook, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Outpourings of gratitude&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that seemingly boundless energy goes into his thoughtful mentorship of undergraduates and graduate students as well as former students who are making their way into the working world or pursuing academic careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those former students become emotional when talking about the way that Griggs influenced the trajectories of their lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juliano Calil, who earned his ocean sciences Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz in 2017, described mentorship as &#8220;one of Gary Griggs&#8217;s superpowers."&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">"He is kind, generous, and has a firm but gentle style that encourages and imparts confidence," Calil said. "His advice and guidance were vital to the completion of my Ph.D. at UCSC and greatly contributed to the work I am doing today. Gary has been a role model as a mentor and a scientist, and I am very proud to have been his 72nd graduate student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiersten &#8220;Kiki&#8221; Patsch started graduate school in marine geology in 2000 with Griggs assigned as her adviser. She had never met him, but he came highly recommended from one of her professors at the University of Virginia, so Patsch packed her bags and dogs and headed out West. She was eager to study coastal processes and hazards under Griggs&#8217;s guidance because she&#8217;d heard &#8220;he was a legend."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Griggs continued encouraging and motivating her even after she&#8217;d completed her graduate studies. After graduate school, her life took a few unexpected turns when she moved back to Virginia.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had four kids and wanted to stay home and take care of the chaos," Patsch said. But she worried constantly about derailing her prospects for an academic career. Could she still regain her footing and become a professor if she devoted herself full-time to being a mom?</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone in my life, except for Gary, told me to give up on my professor dreams,&#8221; Patsch said. But Griggs also told her that both dreams could come true; she could spend all the time she needed looking after her kids, and still pursue her academic career later. His advice was more than just professional, in other words; it was warm and humanistic, taking into account her quality of life and not just her career prospects.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gary told me that I would never look back on my life and wish I had worked more, but I may look back and wish I&#8217;d spent more time with my kids,&#8221; said Patsch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking Griggs&#8217;s words to heart, she lectured here and there, and Griggs wrote her dozens of letters of recommendations for jobs she wasn&#8217;t sure she wanted because she was overwhelmed with parental responsibilities. Then, in 2014, Griggs sent her a job announcement that filled her with joy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was the perfect job, the perfect time, and the perfect place. My littlest was starting kindergarten and my oldest was starting middle school. I was the mom I needed and wanted to be, and now I was going to have the opportunity to be the teacher I wanted to be, one that would be able to influence the lives of students the way Gary had influenced mine. Why not move to the opposite coast and start a new full-time job?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gary pushed me to believe in myself when I felt like a fraud,&#8221; said Patsch, who went on to co-write and edit a 2005 book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living With the Changing California Coast,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Griggs and Lauret Savoy (M.S. '83, Earth sciences). &#8220;Once again, he was believing in me and pushing me even when I wanted to give up on myself.

Yet few are networked on a regional scale. Likewise, current funding structures do not support regional science research over the long term. These omissions hamstring efforts to understand the climate crisis and its impacts plants and animals.</p>
<p>According to a new paper in the journal <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab048/6272439">BioScience</a></em>, regional field studies are the Goldilocks of climate change ecology: just right for examining the impacts of the climate crisis on plants and animals. &#8220;Many of these questions can only be answered at an intermediate, regional scale. That&#8217;s the scale that is really important to organisms and their populations, because they involve dispersal and evolution,&#8221; says coauthor Laurel Fox, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate where species will move in theory, but it&#8217;s another thing to see them consolidate in slightly cooler microsites, demonstrating we have to protect spaces like this or else we&#8217;re going to lose those organisms,&#8221; says lead author Katie Stuble. Now a scientist with the Holden Arboretum in Ohio, Stuble was a UCSC postdoctoral fellow.</p>
<p>The foundational studies of ecology in the American West were all regional in scale, Fox points out. &#8220;Think about Joseph Grinnell&#8217;s groundbreaking science surveying California vertebrates in the 1920s and 30s. He was able to look at hundreds of sites for many years.&#8221; Scientists are now revisiting Grinnell&#8217;s study sites to learn how animals have fared after a century of environmental change.</p>
<p>The authors cite the University of California&#8217;s <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">Natural Reserve System</a> (UC NRS) as a premier example of a regional field station network. Located across California, the 41 reserves of the UC NRS feature examples of most major state ecosystems.</p>
<p>The regional scale of the UC NRS enables scientists to peer into the future with the help of geography. Southern California sites that are hot and dry today offer a glimpse of how climate change is expected to transform more northerly or high elevation locales. And because multiple UC NRS reserves have similar ecosystems, scientists can make &#8220;space for time&#8221; substitutions comparing, say, chaparral or oak savanna at different latitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UC NRS provides a great backbone for thinking about global change research,&#8221; Stuble says. &#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented to have replication of field sites at that fine resolution within a region like California.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long record of research adds further value to studies of field stations like the NRS. &#8220;You can look at climate questions on spatial scales, and you can look at them on longer temporal scales. But when you have historic records, you can verify those trends, and that&#8217;s the sweet spot,&#8221; Stuble says.</p>
<p>Beyond the NRS, however, the authors were able to identify only a handful of other regional-scale networks. These include efforts to coordinate fire research and policy in the southeastern United States, marine productivity in the Caribbean, and freshwater lakes in Canada. Many of these networks have limped along with unstable funding that resulted in data gaps.</p>
<h4>The gaps in a global canvas</h4>
<p>By contrast, networks pursuing work on continental or global scales are relatively plentiful. Many of these, such as the Long-Term Ecological Research Network and Critical Zone Collaborative Network in the United States, are funded by government agencies through targeted programs. These stable, long-term sources of support have enabled these programs to continue for decades.</p>
<p>Yet continental and global networks, the authors contend, lack the resolution to study processes occurring over finer gradients. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network, which extends from Hawaii to Florida, relies on a single site to represent California&#8217;s famously complex environment. The lack of funding for regional research means concerns relevant to climate change and conservation are falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you want to document global climate change dynamics, like where a specific lizard species is going to be in the future, you can&#8217;t look at one site in the Sierra and one site in the Rockies; you would miss all the small shifts the species might make over the course of a century,&#8221; Stuble says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that research done at a local or continental scale isn&#8217;t valuable. It&#8217;s more that they address different questions,&#8221; Fox says. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of biology that&#8217;s happening in the middle.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Strategic conservation</h4>
<p>Regional research is of particular value for conservation. Where species are found now predicts the conditions they will require in the future. This type of data is already being used to model where species will move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several hundred miles in California are variable in ways that are incredibly meaningful to organisms that might be dispersing just ten or a few tens of kilometers,&#8221; Stuble says. For example, range shift information can identify areas to set aside for conservation. &#8220;If you understand that this microhabitat in this mountainous region will become key for conserving species in 20 years, then you would put your efforts into protecting those areas,&#8221; she says.</p>
<h4>Shaping policy</h4>
<p>Data from regional studies are well suited to guide environmental policies. For one thing, similar findings from multiple nearby sites add credence to findings. Governments &#8220;are not necessarily going to respond to one local entity crying out for a particular policy,&#8221; Stuble says. But &#8220;if there are partners doing similar research throughout the state, we could say with high confidence that policy is critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Networks within a political jurisdiction can further amplify the influence of findings. &#8220;Policies are often enacted on the state level. States can enact financial or other incentives,&#8221; Stuble says, effecting change on a broad scale.</p>
<p>For example, field research conducted within the UC NRS is poised to help attain the environmental goals of its home state. Launched in 2018, the California Biodiversity Initiative seeks to safeguard California&#8217;s natural heritage by restoring and protecting habitat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regional-scale research across the state would be ideal for implementing the California Biodiversity Initiative,&#8221; Fox says.</p>
<p>&#8220;More regional work could help inform policies aimed at preserving California&#8217;s biodiversity in the face of climate change and other threats,&#8221; Stuble says.</p>
<h4>A regional climate change institute</h4>
<p>Fox and her late colleague, UC Santa Cruz Professor Barry Sinervo, were so taken with the potential to study climate change on a regional scale that they launched an institute to do just that. In 2015, they established the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/climate-institute.html">Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts (ISEECI)</a> with a five-year, $1.9 million grant from UC&#8217;s Office of the President. The institute was specifically designed to leverage UC NRS reserves across California.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that this network of roughly 40 sites provides a wonderful backbone for research distributed across the region,&#8221; Fox says. &#8220;We could go across a bigger array of sites than we&#8217;d normally be able to fund.&#8221; The grant could defray the extra costs of doing research at several locations, such as travel among sites and the need to buy multiple sets of research equipment.</p>
<p>ISEECI funded postdoctoral fellows, including Stuble, and graduate students from across the University of California to examine how native species have responded to the climate crisis. Together, these findings document an astonishing array of ecological changes propelled by climate change.</p>
<p>For example, researchers from UC San Diego sampled <em>Daphnia</em> water fleas from Sierra Nevada lakes at several elevations, then grew them in warmer water at different altitudes. Temperature affected traits such as growth rates and body size in just a few generations, demonstrating the importance of genetic variation in adapting to climate change.</p>
<p>Another project sampled a lagoon-loving fish called the three-spined stickleback at 25 California estuaries, including two NRS reserves. Populations from drier southern California were known to have fewer bony plates in than those living further north, which needed armor against local predators. An ISEECI researcher from UC Santa Cruz found that over several decades, fish at northern location had lost plates, reflecting the influences of a drier climate.</p>
<p>Other ISEECI studies compared the impact of fog and drought on plant photosynthesis, local lizard population extinctions due to climate change, fire responses by California lilacs, and how environmental conditions across a climate gradient affect decomposition by fungi.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was both exciting and humbling to be able to provide a platform of protected areas for ISEECI research,&#8221; says Peggy Fiedler, Executive Director of the UC Natural Reserve System. &#8220;The UC NRS facilitates exactly the kind of research needed to find both answers and solutions for climate resilience.&#8221;</p>
<h4>The funding conundrum</h4>
<p>For Fox, the experience of running ISEECI underscored not just strengths but also pitfalls facing regional-scale field networks. &#8220;There&#8217;s one-off funding for these kinds of regional studies, but not regular grants. It was so clear with ISEECI that you need institutional support, administrative support, for years to maintain this level of effort across multiple campuses and involving multiple faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>A prime example of what regional-scale field research can accomplish with steady support is Australia&#8217;s Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies. Incorporating multiple field stations operated by a variety of Australian universities and government agencies, the center has provided infrastructure and assistance to studies of the Great Barrier Reef since 2005.</p>
<p>Despite the barriers, informal regional networks of field stations continue to be formed to meet research needs. In time, strong demand may tip the scales to put regional-scale science&#8212;and the long-term funding it requires&#8212;on the map.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8a59817c80727017480ce726126bda44"><name>salmon-streamflows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Survival of migrating juvenile salmon depends on stream flow thresholds</title><summary>New understanding of relationship between stream flows and salmon survival provides a critical tool for balancing water needs in the highly managed Sacramento River.</summary><keywords>Cyril Michel</keywords><start-date>1621494000000</start-date><display-name>Survival of migrating juvenile salmon depends on stream flow thresholds</display-name><path>/2021/05/salmon-streamflows</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/salmon-streamflows</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1621523792218</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621524072565</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/juvenile-salmon-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/juvenile-salmon-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>juvenile-salmon-410.jpg</name><display-name>juvenile-salmon-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>81810</file-size><width>410</width><height>430</height></image><image-alt>juvenile salmon in lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/juvenile-salmon-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/juvenile-salmon-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>juvenile-salmon-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>juvenile-salmon-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20035</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>juvenile salmon in lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Juvenile Chinook salmon were tagged with acoustic transmitters, allowing scientists to track them as they migrated down the Sacramento River to the sea.

Many studies have shown that survival rates of juvenile salmon improve as the amount of water flowing downstream increases, but &#8220;more is better&#8221; is not a useful guideline for agencies managing competing demands for the available water.</p>
<p>Now fisheries scientists have identified key thresholds in the relationship between stream flow and salmon survival that can serve as actionable targets for managing water resources in the Sacramento River. The new analysis, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3498">published May 19 in <em>Ecosphere</em></a>, revealed nonlinear effects in the flow-survival relationship, meaning it changes in stepwise fashion, with significant jumps in survival rates at two key steps.</p>
<p>A threshold defined in the paper as the &#8220;historic mean&#8221; flow of 10,712 cubic feet per second (cfs) provides an especially important target for resource managers, said first author Cyril Michel, a project scientist in the <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a substantial increase in salmon survival above that level, so if we can increase stream flow to that level for critical periods of the year, it would really benefit the salmon populations,&#8221; Michel said.</p>
<h4>Acoustic tags</h4>
<p>The researchers analyzed migration survival data from 2,436 juvenile Chinook salmon tagged with acoustic transmitters and tracked in years with different water flows, from 2013 to 2019. After identifying the key thresholds, the team then used historical data on river flows and salmon migration patterns to run simulations of different management actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to see how much the salmon populations would benefit if we had enacted flows to match that threshold of 10,712 cfs,&#8221; Michel said. &#8220;We found we could increase survival by a lot, sometimes doubling or tripling the survival rates in a given year, without having to spend too much water. It&#8217;s a reasonable target that won&#8217;t break the bank in most years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juvenile salmon migrate out to sea in the spring, which was historically a period of high flows in the Sacramento River. Now, however, dams and water diversions combined with seasonal reductions in flows from tributaries result in spring flows that tend to be the lowest of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of how we&#8217;ve plumbed the Central Valley, salmon now have to migrate out during low flows. So we&#8217;re proposing to enact pulse flows in the spring to bring the river up to historical conditions for short periods of time,&#8221; Michel said.</p>
<h4>Implementing pulse flows</h4>
<p>He noted that plans to implement pulse flows in the Sacramento River are now being developed under environmental permits renegotiated last year for the Central Valley Project, the massive federal water management project that includes the Sacramento River. An interagency group of scientists has agreed to use the 10,712 cfs threshold as the target for these pulse flows, Michel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that this might actually happen this year or next, and we will be tracking survival rates to see how successful it is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This could be a tool that is used for many years to come, with real benefits for salmon populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additional research on the optimal timing of pulse flows could improve their implementation, enabling adaptive management in response to environmental conditions, he added.</p>
<p>The study identified two other thresholds, defined as &#8220;minimum&#8221; (4,259 cfs) and &#8220;high&#8221; (22,872 cfs). Below the minimum threshold, only 3% of the tagged salmon survived the migration. Survival was 18.9% between minimum and historic mean, 50.8% between historic mean and high, and 35.3% above the high threshold.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the main mechanism behind the flow thresholds relates to how fast migrating fish are able to move through the river and get past the hazards along the way. Travel times for fish during flows between the historic mean and high thresholds were significantly shorter than for fish experiencing all other flows.</p>
<p>&#8220;In most years, it&#8217;s best for juvenile salmon to rear in the upper river where it&#8217;s safer, and then move through the lower river as quickly as possible to reduce their exposure to predators and other stressors,&#8221; Michel explained.</p>
<p>The research team includes scientists affiliated with both UC Santa Cruz and NOAA&#8217;s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).

<p>These appointments will run from summer 2021 through spring 2022. Summer commitment is minimal given that work-study jobs start in the fall and remain active through spring. Each faculty facilitator will receive $2,000/year.</p>
<p>Interested faculty should submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0gAD2XaL0Uq4x0shSVc0GboPBaf8DFRN91GqFsJcDrI5qOA/viewform">self-nomination</a>. Questions can be directed to Peter Weiss (pweiss@ucsc.edu) or Christina Ravelo (acr@ucsc.edu).</p>
<p><strong>What is the WSRI?</strong></p>
<p>The Divisional Science DEI Committee has initiated the WSRI to engage students with work-study awards in scientific research, integrate them into the STEM culture, and provide an opportunity to deepen their knowledge in their chosen discipline. Many low-income students at UCSC with work-study awards have declared a major in the Physical and Biological Sciences, yet the number of opportunities for these students to have meaningful work in scientific research is much lower. This initiative seeks to build support for faculty PIs to receive peer-to-peer mentorship training and to hire and retain work-study students for a meaningful research experience. In addition, the initiative supports students by creating a community of scientists for the students to facilitate their growth professionally and personally while earning money.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Facilitators</strong></p>
<p>Faculty facilitators with prior experience working with and mentoring work-study students in their labs will support both students in work-study positions and their faculty mentors (PIs). There will be three facilitators, one from each of three areas: biomedical sciences, physical sciences, and environmental sciences.</p>
<p>To help foster community among the work-study researchers, these facilitators will lead one meeting per quarter to bring together student researchers for socializing, community building activities, and mentoring. Faculty facilitators will also receive mentorship training through the <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> (CITL) and organize meetings with PIs once per quarter to provide a peer-peer resource.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new study, published in the journal </span><a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15650"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Change Biology</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, builds upon the team&#8217;s prior work observing how wildlife in the Santa Cruz Mountains respond to human disturbance. Local observations, for example, have shown that species like pumas and bobcats are less likely to be active in areas where humans are present, while deer and wood rats become bolder and more active. But it&#8217;s difficult to generalize findings like these across larger geographic areas because human-wildlife interactions are often regionally unique.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, to get a continent-wide sense for which species of mammals might be best equipped to live alongside humans, the team combined their local camera trap data with that of researchers throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. This allowed them to track 24 species across 61 regionally diverse camera trap projects to see which larger trends emerged.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We've been very interested for a long time in how human disturbance influences wildlife, and we thought it would be interesting to see how wildlife in general are responding to similar anthropogenic pressures across North America,&#8221; said Chris Wilmers, an environmental studies professor and director of the Santa Cruz Puma Project, who is the paper&#8217;s senior author alongside lead author Justin Suraci.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team was especially interested in understanding how mammals respond to different types of human disturbance and whether these responses were related to species&#8217; traits, like body size, diet, and the number of young they have. Overall, the paper found that 33 percent of mammal species responded negatively to humans, meaning they were less likely to occur in places with higher disturbance and were less active when present, while 58 percent of species were actually positively associated with disturbance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a closer look at these trends, the team broke their results down by two different types of human disturbance. One was the footprint of human development: the things that people build, like roads, houses, and agricultural fields. Another was the mere presence of people, including activities like recreation and hunting, since fear of humans can change an animal&#8217;s behavior and use of space.</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="A moose walking through the forest" class="" height="233" src="images/moose-350.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="350"/>
<figcaption>Moose were generally less active near people or development.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparing continent-wide data from camera trap locations with varying levels of human development, researchers found that grizzly bears, lynx, wolves, and wolverines were generally less likely to be found in more developed areas and were less active when they did visit. Moose and martens were also less active in areas with a higher development footprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, raccoons and white-tailed deer were actually more likely to hang out in more developed areas and were more active in these spaces. Elk, mule deer, striped skunks, red foxes, bobcats, coyotes, and pumas weren&#8217;t more likely to be found in developed landscapes, but they did tend to be more active in these areas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the species that frequent more developed areas may actually benefit from living in these places, but the study&#8217;s lead author, Justin Suraci, a lead scientist at Conservation Science Partners and former postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz, says that&#8217;s not necessarily the case. While raccoons can thrive in developed areas by finding food in our garbage cans and avoiding predators, higher levels of puma activity in these same places could mean something very different.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not because these developed areas are really good for puma activity,&#8221; Suraci said. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably because the camera traps happened to be set in the one pathway that the poor puma can use when it's navigating its way through an otherwise very heavily developed landscape.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, some animals in the study may be increasingly active or present on cameras near human development simply because there&#8217;s such little remaining natural habitat.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there were certain traits that emerged across species as clear advantages for making a living within the footprint of development. Overall, mammals that were smaller and faster-reproducing, with generalist diets, were the most positively associated with development. Researchers expected they might find similar results in comparing camera trap data by levels of human presence, but in fact, both positive and negative responses to human presence were observed for species across the spectrum of body sizes and diets.&#160;</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="A red fox standing in a road" class="" height="233" src="images/fox-350.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="350"/>
<figcaption>Red foxes were the only animals in the study that seemed <br/> suited to high levels of human disturbance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elk were less likely to stick around in places frequented by humans, and moose, mountain goats, and wolverines were less active in these habitats. On the other hand, bighorn sheep, black bears, and wolverines were more likely to be found in areas frequented by humans, while mule deer, bobcats, grey foxes, pumas, and wolves were more active.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One trend that may be influencing these findings is the growth of outdoor recreation, which increases levels of human presence in otherwise remote and wild landscapes. The study&#8217;s results may indicate that most mammals are willing to tolerate some level of human recreation in order to remain in high quality habitats, and they could instead be increasing their nocturnal activity in order to avoid humans. Some animals may even take advantage of hiking trails and fire roads as easy movement pathways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the study also clearly identified that there&#8217;s a limit to how much human impact animals can withstand. Even among species that were either more active or more likely to be present around humans or in developed areas, those effects peaked at low to intermediate levels of human disturbance then began to decline beyond those thresholds. Red foxes were the only animals in the study that seemed to continue to be more active or present at medium to high levels of human disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, most species have both something to lose and something to gain from being around humans, and understanding the cutoff at which the costs outweigh the benefits for each species will be important to maintaining suitable habitats that support diversity in mammal populations for the future. Suraci says this may prove to be the new paper&#8217;s most important contribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From a management perspective, I think the thresholds that we've started to identify are going to be really relevant,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This can help us get a sense of how much available habitat is actually out there for recolonizing or reintroduced species and hopefully allow us to more effectively coexist with wildlife in human-dominated landscapes.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8bb1544580727017480ce72640c66994"><name>vc-student-affairs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kicking off search for Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Success</title><summary>We are pleased to announce the kickoff of the leadership recruitment for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Success.</summary><start-date>1621494000000</start-date><display-name>Kicking off search for Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Success</display-name><path>/2021/05/vc-student-affairs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/vc-student-affairs</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1621546325027</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621546325027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce the kickoff of the leadership recruitment for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Success.</p>

<p>The campus will hold a <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/a_virtual_celebration_of_uc_santa_cruz_alumna_stacy_jupiter#.YJWOCutlBTY">virtual celebration of Jupiter and her work </a>on Tuesday, May 25, from 5:30&#8211;7 p.m. During this live event, Jupiter will share her research adventures and her unusual but impactful approach to problem-solving and communication.&#160;</p>
<p>For Jupiter, this event will be a homecoming of sorts, even though she&#8217;ll be beaming in via Zoom from an island that lies 5,319 miles to the southwest of UC Santa Cruz, and is 19 hours ahead in terms of time zone.&#160;</p>
<p>Jupiter has been living in Fiji for the past 13 years, &#8220;but I feel like I never really left Santa Cruz," she said. &#8220;I used to go back multiple times every year, and if I were to move back to anywhere in America, it would probably be Santa Cruz. It&#8217;s the place I feel most like myself, most at home.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and people skills</strong></p>
<p>While in graduate school at UC Santa Cruz, Jupiter worked in northern Australia, studying how land mismanagement in a Queensland watershed harmed coastal mangroves and coral reefs.&#160;</p>
<p>Her faculty adviser, Donald Potts, recognized her seriousness of purpose, combined with disarming people skills. Jupiter was equally comfortable playing with village children and having formal dialogues with government officials.</p>
<p>That skill set now comes to bear in Fiji, where Jupiter shows respect for local cultural practices, drawing from her field research and her conversations with islanders, to help residents protect the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems, while considering the human impacts of conservation.&#160;</p>
<p>For instance, Jupiter and her colleagues have shown the relationship between excessive development and devastating coastal floods, and how the floods give rise to typhoid outbreaks, linking the fate of humankind with the natural world.&#160;</p>
<p>Melanesian communities have been managing coral reefs and other natural resources for hundreds of thousands of years, Jupiter said. Rules of environmental use and access are part of their customary system of governance. Melanesian communities close coral reef habitats to fishing periodically, a practice known as <em>tabu.&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong>At the same time, resources have been commercialized everywhere so there is an erosion of the traditional stewardship,&#8221; Jupiter said. &#8220;With businesses trying to cash in on resources, there is an immediate need to revitalize age-old connections between the residents and their environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and her colleague Aaron Jenkins, a senior aquatic ecologist, have studied the impacts of human activity in watersheds and how that development affects downstream fisheries that are vital for food and culture. When she spoke about devastating impacts to local residents, including the effects of floods, a grown man in the audience began to weep.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even that was not enough [for local residents] to say no to the money coming in from logging companies,&#8221; she said.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The power of outreach</strong></p>
<p>Jupiter hopes that recent findings&#8212;with scientists discovering spikes in water-borne bacterial diseases such as typhoid a few months after floods take place&#8212;could influence public opinion.&#160;</p>
<p>During her presentation for UC Santa Cruz, Jupiter will discuss her latest findings and outreach programs, as well as her evolution as a scientist who values outreach.&#160;</p>
<p>She started out wanting to be a marine biologist, learning how to do scientific writing, and watching how scientists presented material to lay audiences.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look around the audience and see a lot of blank looks, you realize that this is great information, but if no one understands what you&#8217;re presenting, it doesn&#8217;t have an impact," Jupiter said. "So how do you bridge that? How do you translate that into action? These days, my work is less focused on science and analysis and more focused on translating that work in ways that will inspire people to change behaviors.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c43857780727017480ce726a29a8320"><name>covid-vaccine-testimonials</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A shot in the arm</title><summary>Six UC Santa Cruz community members tell the tale of getting the COVID-19 vaccine in 2021.</summary><start-date>1621551600000</start-date><display-name>A shot in the arm</display-name><path>/2021/05/covid-vaccine-testimonials</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/covid-vaccine-testimonials</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1621555905861</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621556069671</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cheri O'Neil</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/arm-in-arm-square.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/arm-in-arm-square.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arm-in-arm-square.jpg</name><display-name>arm-in-arm-square.jpg</display-name><file-size>19137</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz's vaccination advocacy campaign, Arm in Arm, is aimed at communicating to ou</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/egan-claire-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/egan-claire-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>egan-claire-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>egan-claire-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2575</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Claire Egan (Merrill '21, molecular, cell and developmental biology; education minor), a m</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's vaccination advocacy campaign,&#160;</span><strong>Arm in Arm,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;is aimed at communicating to our campus community the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine for a safe reopening of California and UC Santa Cruz.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/zuniga-martha.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/zuniga-martha.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zuniga-martha.jpg</name><display-name>zuniga-martha.jpg</display-name><file-size>44065</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Martha Zúñiga: “I was so excited to</image-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Martha Z&#250;&#241;iga: &#8220;I was so excited to get my COVID-19 vaccine.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a year of teaching the biology of coronaviruses, specifically the SARS-CoV-2, along with the immune responses to viruses and vaccines, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Martha Z&#250;&#241;iga was able to add herself to the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was so excited to get my COVID-19 vaccine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I felt the same excitement that I felt on Christmas morning when I was a little girl.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-encourages-covid-19-vaccinations-university-communities-while-reviewing-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California announces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its vaccine requirements, with FDA approval, and the return of in-person instruction this fall, scientists and faculty members like Z&#250;&#241;iga, as well as staff members and students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> share their stories of getting their shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;re people like Bill Prime, who heads up UC Santa Cruz Dining Services, which worked through the pandemic to provide meals for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-person instruction was suspended and shelter-in-place orders mandated at the university in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2020, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime&#8217;s operations were upended. Caf&#233;s were closed, and dining-hall meals moved to take-out mode with a new app for ordering, Plexiglas barriers, and compostable to-go containers and bags.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The giant Post-it notes all over my office tell the tale of change, which was constant for my 35 managers and 158 career staff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Twice a week, we&#8217;d have meetings to update the staff on mask mandates, tests, and safety protocols.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to keep everyone working or busy, they contracted with the county to provide food for 16 homeless shelters, and last summer, when the campus was </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-wildfire-evacuation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evacuated during the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZU Lightning Complex fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they relocated to the Boardwalk&#8217;s Cocoanut Grove.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They provided more than 3,000 meals a day for displaced community members and fire victims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the COVID-19 vaccines were in development, Prime acknowledged that he didn&#8217;t want to be an early adopter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But cases started to spiral out of control, and we had people testing positive,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I realized I needed to take the lead. When our team was able to get to the first round in February, I was at the front of the line for the shot.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A teaching moment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z&#250;&#241;iga taught her students about numerous topics related to COVID-19, such as its neurological, pulmonary, and coronary effects; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the physics and efficacy of face coverings; the psychological wellbeing of caregivers treating COVID-19 patients; and complications of the virus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent one day studying a mouse model of the prototypical Moderna vaccine and of the immune response to it and its efficacy in the mouse model,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hasn&#8217;t been able to convince everyone of the importance of immunization, but she&#8217;s quick to describe what it was like for her after her shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I did have flu-like symptoms after the second dose&#8212;chiefly chills, fever, malaise, and aches,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I expected these, and I was prepared. I scheduled my vaccines on a Friday so I would have the weekend to recover from them. The symptoms began about nine hours after I received the vaccine and lasted for a total of about 42 hours. But the chills lasted only about 12 hours, and the fever lasted less than 24 hours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the vaccine continues to roll out, Z&#250;&#241;iga said, &#8220;I want as many people to be immunized as possible. It feels so liberating to know that we can be together, as long as we&#8217;re immunized. I also want people not to drop their guard, to continue to wear masks and take other sensible precautions, such as avoiding crowds."</span></p>
<h3><strong>Back out in the field</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Kern, a staff researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences, says the last year has been a challenge, both with the pandemic and with the CZU Fire. As a coastal salmonid ecologist, she researches salmon populations in local watersheds, and her crew has been able to keep up with the field work, following</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strict COVID guidelines and requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of the people I work with are younger than me, and for a year, I didn&#8217;t go out in the field with them," she said. "I stayed in my house, working on data and scheduling. It was hard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When her turn came to roll up her sleeve, she was happy. But there were side effects in the middle of the night after the second shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chills, fever, cold sweats, shaking, dizziness, nausea&#8212;I was not feeling well, and I canceled meetings the next day to stay in bed,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she were to tell others who are afraid to get the shot, she&#8217;d say, &#8220;You may have unpleasant side effects, but that&#8217;s good. The vaccine is meant to trigger your body to recognize that antigen, to fight it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a year of turning away student interns to work in the field, she&#8217;s conducting interviews in the hopes the university will allow internships to resume in the summer and fall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If requiring vaccinations helps valuable research to ramp up, then I am all for it,&#8221; Kern said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A student&#8217;s vaccine experience&#160;&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Claire Egan (Merrill '21, molecular, cell and developmental biology; education minor), the coronavirus vaccines represent an unprecedented scientific achievement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She got her first dose of the Moderna vaccination back in January, before almost anyone she knew, as she worked at the university&#8217;s COVID-19 testing site. She experienced side effects the day after her second shot, with a headache, sore arm, and chills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the weeks following my vaccines, I was surprised by how much better I felt emotionally,&#8221; she said. &#8220;None of my social distancing or mask-wearing routines had changed, but I was able to feel safer at work as a COVID tester, and at home, where I lived with seven housemates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It made everyday experiences like going to the grocery store feel less stressful as well.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her shots, she worked at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn vaccination site, handing out vaccination cards to people after their first doses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was great to see a diversity of people in the UCSC community and their excitement for a step forward," Egan said. "</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic changed the plans I had for my final two years of school and made me feel disconnected from college life. Despite these challenges, I think I will look back and be proud that I found a way to help the UCSC community through testing and vaccination.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>&#8216;Trust the science&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bari Nazario, facilities and flow cytometry manager for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was relieved when she was able to get her second Moderna vaccine in mid-February. She&#8217;s worked throughout the pandemic and has checked on the labs every week on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also felt a little teary-eyed. &#8220;When I got that first vaccine, it was a pretty emotional day, and I still feel that way," she said. "We made it, my husband and I and my 93-year-old father, who is living alone. The relief was overwhelming.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she sees the vaccine as our way to open the world again, and she&#8217;s cautiously optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like we&#8217;re in a waiting mode, and if we can get through next winter and see the efficacy of these vaccines, then I think we&#8217;re in a good spot,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the people who are hesitant to get vaccinated, she said, &#8220;If I could say one thing, it&#8217;s this: Trust the science. Do your research, and try to make the best decision for yourself and for the people around you. Science says the virus needs people. So, if we&#8217;re all vaccinated, it all dies out.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A granddaughter&#8217;s story</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zeka Glucs, academic coordinator for the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, the pandemic has been an historic one for her family. She and her sister cared for their grandmother, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elaine Heyman, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who was born during the Spanish Flu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also known as the 1918 influenza pandemic. She died on May 14 of this year, just a few weeks before her 103rd birthday.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a time of holding my breath, as I was terrified of bringing the virus to someone I love,&#8221; said Glucs, who continues to do research and teach remotely but looks forward to being back on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her grandmother was able to get vaccinated in February, and it took a month or two before the rest of the family could enter the same safety zone. For Glucs, the only side effects from the Pfizer vaccine were a little fatigue and a sore arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never second-guessed getting the shot, because of my personal circumstances&#8212;and because I trust the science,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It felt like a family accomplishment for all of us to be vaccinated and to be able to be with my grandmother in her passing.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>

For 2021, the program will fund multidisciplinary projects that involve drone technology. This includes the innovative use of existing technology, the development of new technology, or examinations of the impacts of specific drone technologies and applications. Projects should address solutions to significant social challenges.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Campus Seed Funding program, which is separate from the broader CITRIS Core Seed Funding initiative, focuses on strengthening interdisciplinary connections on the Santa Cruz campus and requires project teams to include at least two principal investigators from different UC Santa Cruz campus divisions. The program will fund early-stage research that furthers the CITRIS and the Banatao Institute mission and exhibits strong promise of securing external funding.</p>
<p>Drone-related proposals may address, but are not limited to, the following areas of research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture and AgTech;</li>

<p>Punjabi language instruction has been offered at UCSC since 2012, currently the only course in a modern South Asian language on campus. Only UC Berkeley has offered Punjabi language for a longer continuous period. Now, a complete three-quarter online curriculum is available to UC students across the system.</p>
<p>Punjabi is spoken by about 130 million people worldwide and is the third most common language in California&#8217;s Central Valley, home to one of the largest Punjabi communities outside of India.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a big unmet need for a significant minority group in California,&#8221; said Nirvikar Singh, UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of economics, who helped bring the online course to fruition as a co-principal investigator on the project. Singh, besides being an economist, was the first holder of the Sarbjit Singh Aurora Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies at UCSC, appointed in 2010. Last year, Guriqbal Sahota, associate professor of literature, succeeded him as chair.</p>
<p><strong>Guru Nanak Heritage Fund</strong><br/><br/>Punjabi language teaching on campus has been enabled by income from the Guru Nanak Heritage Fund, an endowment that was raised by the Bay Area Sikh community, and placed at UCSC in 2012, through the efforts of Singh, and of Inderjit Kaur, a specialist in South Asian musical cultures, including Sikh musical worship. She is assistant professor of music at the University of Michigan, as well as a research associate in music at UCSC. Singh developed the initial Punjabi curriculum at UCSC, using the UC Berkeley program as a foundation. <br/><br/>&#8220;This is our heritage, this is something we needed to make happen,&#8221; said Singh, whose grandfather wrote novels and non-fiction in Punjabi, and whose father translated a major history of the Sikhs from English to Punjabi. Singh said he learned the language as a child in India, but was taught Hindi and Sanskrit in school, without the option of formally studying Punjabi, even in a city with a large Punjabi-speaking minority. &#8220;For complicated historical reasons, Punjabi as a literary language has tended to be marginalized,&#8221; he noted.<br/><br/>The course is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2iUte21WzQ&amp;t=66s">Punjabi Without Walls</a> and is a complex muliti-media project designed around a series of interactive software modules to help students learn how to read and write the Gurmukhi script and also become comfortable holding basic conversations in Punjabi. To practice writing, a mobile app allows students to trace characters with their fingers and receive feedback on accuracy.</p>
<p>Technical and video production for the grammar components of the course sequence were done at UC Santa Cruz, led by Michael Tassio and UCSC&#8217;s online education office, along with Daniel Rudin, a doctoral student in Film &amp; Digital Media. And it all happened beginning last summer after the SARS CoV-2 pandemic closed the campus, sent everyone home, and turned teaching and learning into an online practice.</p>
<p><strong>Expertise of multiple campuses</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to leverage the expertise of multiple campuses,&#8221; Tassio said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been an extraordinary effort from so many people.&#8221; Tassio&#8217;s online learning office expanded from supporting 15 courses at the beginning of 2020 to supporting several thousand during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The online course was developed with contributions from multiple UC campuses, with the lead being taken by Davis, where more than 800 Punjabi American students are enrolled, and Santa Cruz, with its active Punjabi language program. Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Riverside, and Irvine all made contributions in different ways.<br/>Principal funding came from the UC Office of the President&#8217;s Innovative Learning Technology Initiative, with support from campus funds and private donors. At UC Santa Cruz, Singh used income from the Aurora chair to create an all-UC online version of a course, &#8220;Introduction to the Sikhs,&#8221; which he developed and has taught at UCSC for a decade. The two-unit course will complement the language instruction by providing contextual information on the Sikh community, for whom Punjabi is also the language of sacred texts.</p>
<p>Another key contributor to the overall effort is UC Santa Cruz lecturer Arshinder Kaur, who has taught Punjabi on campus since 2012, and has an extensive background in Punjabi language teaching and Punjabi literature. The members of the development team included two other UCSC graduate student researchers and a UC Riverside doctoral student, Tejpaul Bainiwal, who became so committed to the project&#8217;s successful completion that he arranged additional funding from his home campus. Numerous faculty and students from Davis and other campuses, as well as language experts from the community, participated in the project.</p>
<p><strong>Input from native speakers</strong></p>
<p>Native speakers reviewed course content and were videotaped at UCSC speaking conversational Punjabi, the first time that community members provided direct input in course development, Tassio said.</p>
<p>The course-development team is adjusting and refining the software modules and videos based on student comments, now that the course sequence is in its second quarter of being offered. The curriculum is focused on language, but includes aspects of Punjabi culture, such as food, health, festivals, and social issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Language is absolutely important for a people,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;It is part of their identity. This is part of me, this is us as a community.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2iUte21WzQ&amp;t=66s</url><title>Punjabi

renowned chef and food activist Alice Waters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>That evening, Waters will celebrate the occasion by appearing in a live conversation with bestselling author Michael Pollan to discuss the impact of food and its quality on society and the planet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The live virtual event is presented by Bookshop Santa Cruz and Extended Session, and co-sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Institute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><i>We Are What We Eat </i>details how many of the most urgent problems that we face in today&#8217;s world&#8212;such as economic disparity, environmental degradation, illness, and social unrest&#8212;are all at some level connected to food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Working with regional farmers over the years, Waters came to the realization that the phenomenon of fast food culture, which prioritized cheapness, availability, and speed, was not only destroying our health, but also dehumanizing the ways we live and relate to one another.</span></p>
<p><span>Waters makes the case that by changing the way we eat and abandoning fast food values, we can be empowered to create a different kind of culture that embraces and nurtures values such as biodiversity, seasonality, stewardship, and balance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>She argues that how we choose to eat has the potential for individual and global transformation by shifting our relationship to food.</span></p>
<p><span>Waters is executive chef, founder, and owner of Chez Panisse, the Berkeley restaurant that made &#8220;farm to table&#8221; a household phrase. As vice president of Slow Food International and founder of the Edible Schoolyard Project, she has helped bring food awareness to people of all ages all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most visible supporters of the organic food movement, she is a pioneer of a culinary philosophy that maintains that cooking should be based on the finest and freshest seasonal ingredients that are produced sustainably and locally.</span></p>
<p><span>Waters's commitment to education led to the creation in 1996 of The Edible Schoolyard at a Berkeley middle school: a one-acre garden, an adjacent kitchen-classroom, and an "eco-gastronomic" curriculum. The program is nationally recognized for its efforts to integrate gardening, cooking, and sharing school lunch into the core academic curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span>The success of The Edible Schoolyard led to the School Lunch Initiative, whose national agenda integrates a nutritious daily lunch and gardening experience into the academic curriculum of all public schools in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>Waters has won numerous awards, including the National Humanities Medal, the French Legion of Honor Medal, the Cavaliere of the Italian Republic, and three James Beard Awards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2015, UC Santa Cruz awarded her the Foundation Medal at its 50th anniversary celebration &#8220;for launching a culinary revolution and teaching us values that transform lives and the world around us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Michael Pollan is the author of eight books, six of which have been <i>New York Times</i>&#160;bestsellers. <i>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, </i>won the California Book Award, the Northern California Book Award, and the James Beard Award for best food writing. It was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.</span></p>
<p><span>A contributing writer to the&#160;<i>New York Times Magazine</i>&#160;since 1987, Pollan has received numerous honors over the years, and in 2010 <i>Time Magazine</i> named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. His essays have appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Harper&#8217;s</em>, as well as in numerous anthologies, including <i>Best American Essays, Best American Science Writing</i>, and the <i>Norton Book of Nature Writing</i>.</span></p>

While we can hardly contain ourselves, there&#8217;s still much to do in preparation for this unique Commencement season. We&#8217;re in need of volunteers to help make sure everything runs smoothly before, during, and after our first ever Slug Crossing. Volunteers before and after will assist with setting up signage, preparing the space for the weekend, and cleaning up after the weekend is over. Volunteer roles over the weekend are designed to help usher graduates and their guests through the experience at various checkpoints.&#160;</div>
<br/>
<div><a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c44aeae2ea3fec70-2021">Sign up to volunteer</a> for one (or more!) times. Once you select a time, you will receive a confirmation email and a calendar invite to join an optional volunteer orientation on Monday, June 7 at 2pm. Please share widely with any colleagues who might be willing and able to help make sure this is a memorable celebration for our Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 graduates.&#160;</div>
<br/>
<div>The <a href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/">commencement website</a> has more information and an overview of the Slug Crossing. New this year, we&#8217;ve added an FAQ section that features separate sections for responses to questions from both the grad and guest viewpoints. We are updating our website as information becomes available (and our FAQ gets longer by the day) so I&#8217;d encourage you to visit it if you&#8217;re curious to learn more about all things commencement related.</div>

She had a big party, she had the cake, she said all her goodbyes.</p>
<p>But it was not to be. When COVID&#8211;19 hit, all operations were disrupted, and Cowell Student Health Center Director Dr. Elizabeth Miller asked Saint John if she would consider staying on to help with the COVID response team. Saint John couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a need,&#8221; said Saint John, who had served as clinic director for 13 years. &#8220;I had skills, knowledge and history that would allow me to step right into the position and help. I wanted to do something to help in this global pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for risk and safety services, wanted a registered nurse to be part of building COVID mitigation strategies, including figuring out records management, contact training, quarantine and isolation process and more. So that was the role Saint John filled.</p>
<p>One challenge was to integrate the electronic medical record with the new pandemic procedures. Saint John felt confident about helping with that as she knew the electronic medical record system very well.</p>
<p>Another hurdle was managing contact tracing for students. While Saint John was aware of it as a way of preventing virus spread, she had never done it before. The process involves identifying people who may have come into contact with an infected person and giving them guidance about what steps to take. Saint John and other staff members learned the procedures by enrolling in an online course offered by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Saint John said she gets a variety of reactions when she calls students to tell them they have been exposed to the virus. Some are expecting her call and others are shocked. Most are receptive to what she has to say. She starts out by reassuring them of the purpose of her call, saying: &#8220;You&#8217;re not in trouble. This is a safety issue. We&#8217;re helping each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saint John said she is awe of the job campus housing has done setting up quarantine and isolation units for students, including setting up food deliveries. The dining service delivers food to the student&#8217;s door if the student is on campus and Slug Support helps figure out food deliveries if the student lives off campus.</p>
<p>Isolation housing (for students who have COVID&#8211;19) is particularly difficult as students must have their own bathroom. &#8220;It&#8217;s depressing,&#8221; Saint John said. &#8220;You&#8217;re sick and alone in this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the university&#8217;s case managers are all licensed marriage-family therapists or clinical social workers and are able to help with the emotional needs of the situation. Students in quarantine or isolation are assigned quarantine buddies to regularly check in on them.</p>
<p>Saint John is impressed at how well the campus community has adapted to the new COVID&#8211;19 mitigation measures, such mask mandates. People weren&#8217;t used to masks or social distancing but most were willing to adopt these measures. &#8220;People really understood what needed to happen and they said &#8216;We&#8217;re going to do this, we&#8217;re all going to step through and do this,&#8217;&#8221; said Sant John. &#8220;This is amazing and beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gives particular praise to university staff who completely changed jobs on a dime and stepped into new roles. She cited the Student Health Services staff, including nurses, clinicians, receptionists, lab and pharmacy personnel, who continued to come to campus and provide-in-person care during the hole pandemic. &#8220;It&#8217;s a testament to all the people here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While it might have been easier for her to just retire and not adapt to the changing university world of the pandemic, Saint John has no regrets about her decision. &#8220;If I had retired, I might have gone crazy,&#8221; she said with a laugh. She said that as long as she is providing real help, she loves continuing to work at the university.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9fb6e28780727017480ce726fdb64349"><name>outstanding-staff-award-nominations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>Please help us honor UC Santa Cruz's outstanding staff and make your nomination for the Outstanding Staff Award today.</summary><start-date>1621839600000</start-date><display-name>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</display-name><path>/2021/05/outstanding-staff-award-nominations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/outstanding-staff-award-nominations</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1621882233416</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621882362137</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Do you know a UC Santa Cruz staff member who:</span><span>&#160;</span></p>

Though we have all had the shared experience of a pandemic, it has affected us differently and the means by which each of us will process the next phase will differ. In the weeks to come, additional resources and training opportunities will be rolled out to take into account the variety of needs different employees will have. One certainty is that we all will need to continue to model compassion and patience with each other. Those values have been critical to the Slug community over the past year and will continue to be essential.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

Our thoughts today are with every person impacted by abuses of power, police violence and anti-Black racism. There is no silver lining to violence, no lesson learned that could ever compensate for the loss of life. As we move forward as individuals and communities, we must do so in ways that honor the memories of those we have lost.</p>
<p>To center and connect us, we ask that you take one minute at 10 a.m. for silent reflection in honor of George Floyd&#8217;s life. We ask that instructors, managers, and supervisors respect this time and create space for their classes and meetings to pause. If you are physically alone at that time, know that you are emotionally together with your UC Santa Cruz community in memorial silence.</p>
<p>The impact of the past year is real and profound. So much has been required, even when everyone has so much less to give. Thank you all for continuing to show up for one another and continuing to learn, teach, and work to support our mission while bearing these weights. Thank you, too, for your partnership in the anti-racism efforts on our campus as we work to build a community where everyone can thrive.</p>

<p>Researchers found that a single dose of tabernanthalog (TBG) can correct stress-induced behavioral deficits, including anxiety and cognitive inflexibility, and also promotes the regrowth of neuronal connections and restores neural circuits in the brain that are disrupted by stress. The study was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01159-1">published May 25 in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very surprising that a single treatment with a low dose had such dramatic effects within a day,&#8221; said corresponding author Yi Zuo, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I had a hard time believing it even when I saw the initial data.&#8221;</p>
<p>TBG was developed in the lab of coauthor David Olson at UC Davis. Zuo&#8217;s lab worked with Olson on the initial studies of TBG, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3008-z">reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2020</a>. The new study focused on the deleterious effects of stress using a protocol in which mice are subjected to mild, unpredictable stressors over a period of several days.</p>
<p>On the behavioral level, stress causes increased anxiety, deficits in sensory processing, and reduced flexibility in decision-making. In the brain, stress disrupts the connections between neurons and alters the neuronal circuitry, resulting in an imbalance between excitation and inhibition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazingly, TBG reversed all of the effects of stress,&#8221; Zuo said.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the use of psychedelic substances for treating illnesses such as addiction, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The hallucinogenic effects of these drugs remain a concern, however, and scientists have been unsure whether the hallucinations are therapeutically important or just a side effect.</p>
<p>Ibogaine has shown promise for treating addiction, but it causes dangerous heart arrhythmias in addition to being a powerful hallucinogen. TBG has not yet been tested in humans, but it lacks ibogaine&#8217;s toxicity in animal tests, and it doesn&#8217;t induce the head-twitch behavior in mice caused by known hallucinogens.</p>
<p>Initial studies of TBG found that it had antidepressant effects and reduced addictive behaviors in rodents. The new study was initiated by co-first author Michelle Tjia, then a graduate student in Zuo&#8217;s lab studying the effects of stress. After Tjia left for a postdoctoral position, co-first author Ju Lu, a project scientist in the lab, led additional studies. The researchers conducted a range of tests to evaluate behavioral responses to stress and the effects of treatment with TBG. They also performed imaging studies to assess changes in the brains of the mice at the neuronal level.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study provides significant insights into neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psychedelic analogs on mental illnesses and paves the way for future investigations to understand their cellular and circuit mechanisms,&#8221; Zuo said.</p>
<p>Studies using animal models&#8212;conducted in accordance with NIH regulations and reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees&#8212;remain vital to investigating complex psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to Lu, Tjia, Olson, and Zuo, the coauthors include Brian Mullen, Kacper Lukasiewicz, Sajita Shah-Morales, and Sydney Weiser at UC Santa Cruz, Bing Cao and Lu Chen at Stanford University, and Lindsay Cameron at UC Davis. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Max Planck Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a4c528a180727017480ce726b71fa15b"><name>growing-traditional-asian-vegetables</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Growing heritage and healing through traditional Asian vegetables</title><summary>Faculty, staff, and alumni are drawing upon and strengthening their cultural heritage and connection to Asian foodways to cultivate traditional vegetables.</summary><start-date>1621926000000</start-date><path>/2021/05/growing-traditional-asian-vegetables</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/growing-traditional-asian-vegetables</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1621967054955</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621967054955</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/scf-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/scf-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scf-250.jpg</name><display-name>scf-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>74473</file-size><width>250</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Scott Chang-Fleeman holding a basket of freshly picked vegetables</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/pepper-plants-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/pepper-plants-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pepper-plants-80.jpg</name><display-name>pepper-plants-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>29625</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Pepper plants in the greenhouse being cared for my staff</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Chang-Fleeman is an environmental studies and CASFS apprenticeship alumnus who went on to found Shao Shan Farm. He specializes in growing organic Asian heritage vegetable varieties.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of faculty, staff, and alumni from UC Santa Cruz are drawing upon and strengthening their cultural heritage and connection to Asian foodways to cultivate traditional vegetables, build community, and promote agroecological and socioecological diversity and representation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Chang-Fleeman first started growing organic choy sum, a leafy vegetable common in Chinese cuisine, while he was a second year apprentice at the </span><a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CASFS) in 2018. Chang-Fleeman is a third-generation bi-racial Chinese American who didn&#8217;t grow up with a strong connection to Chinese culture. This project was, in part, a journey of self-discovery for him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of my farm and garden education up to that point had been more Eurocentric, so I wanted to be able to take the same skills and resources and apply it to Asian vegetables,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It kind of tied in with me wanting to explore my own identity more. And the Asian vegetables I&#8217;m used to, you rarely find certified organic. They&#8217;re pretty much always conventional and really cheap, grown with a lot of pesticides.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chang-Fleeman wanted to offer different options through organic methods. So he sourced choy sum seeds, got the plants started in the CASFS greenhouse, then transferred the seedlings into the fields at the UCSC Farm. The crop thrived. One day, Darryl Wong, UCSC&#8217;s farm site and research lands manager, asked Chang-Fleeman what he intended to do with his vegetables.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were out walking through the fields at the time, and Chang-Fleeman jokingly replied that he&#8217;d like to sell vegetables to Brandon Jew, the chef and owner of famed San Francisco-based Chinese American restaurant Mister Jiu&#8217;s. As it happened, Wong knew Brandon Jew well, so he gave him a call. Jew agreed to connect with Chang-Fleeman to offer feedback on his vegetables, and an important partnership grew from there, Wong says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was really neat to see the synchronous vision that both Brandon and Scott had of trying to bring back this embracing of Chinese culture through food,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;On Scott&#8217;s side, he was really trying to highlight these crops to bring attention to how exciting new varietals of Asian vegetables can be, and Brandon expressed a similar desire to really embrace Chinatown and Chinese culture for all that it is and showcase it. As a second-generation Chinese American myself, that&#8217;s exciting to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership with Mister Jiu&#8217;s grew into a business opportunity when Chang-Fleeman founded </span><a href="https://www.shaoshanfarm.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shao Shan Farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Marin County after completing his apprenticeship program. The farm now sells produce to restaurants and directly to consumers through a CSA program that is largely supported by Asian American customers. Chang-Fleeman also attends farmers markets in predominantly Asian American neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and says he enjoys working directly with the community to grow the types of produce that people want to eat.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This all started with me building deeper relations and reconnection to my Chinese American heritage and identity, but now I feel that the purpose of the farm is more to be able to hold space and hold a resource for the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just lucky enough to be able to go along for the ride and get to explore my own identity through this avenue.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chang-Fleeman said he also feels a strong calling as an Asian American voice in sustainability and environmentalism. He previously completed his undergraduate degree in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and was mentored by Professor Flora Lu, who impressed on him the critical need for representation of diverse Asian American identities within the field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a long way to go to visibilize the environmental efforts of BIPOC,&#8221; said Lu, a Chinese-American immigrant and the provost of Colleges Nine and Ten. &#8220;That of course includes Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, who represent a significant and increasing segment of our campus community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Chang-Fleeman, farming was a way to live out his commitment to representation. He&#8217;s now part of </span><a href="https://www.secondgenerationseeds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Generation Seeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collaborative of Asian American growers across the West Coast who are preserving and improving important heirloom vegetable varieties. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kellee Matsushita-Tseng, assistant manager of the UCSC farm garden, is also a member of this network and is currently breeding new varieties of celtuce and growing chili peppers from a seed bank on behalf of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are focusing on preservation of both the genetics of these plants and the knowledge and cultural legacies that come with them,&#8221; Matsushita-Tseng said. &#8220;And we focus on reclaiming the ability to define the story of Asian vegetables within the community, as opposed to having it co-opted or marketed by white growers or white audiences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsushita-Tseng says there&#8217;s been a lot of &#8220;trending&#8221; lately around fruits and vegetables that are common in a wide variety of Asian cuisines. These foods are increasingly being appropriated by white-owned agricultural companies and marketed as &#8220;exotic&#8221; or &#8220;superfoods,&#8221; which continues the industry&#8217;s long history of exploiting Asian Americans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants from China, Japan, the Philippines, and beyond played a crucial role in building the U.S. agricultural sector, but racist policies and violence historically excluded them from the industry&#8217;s wealth. Today, Asian Americans make up less than 1 percent of the nation&#8217;s farmers. That&#8217;s why groups like Second Generation Seeds and the Asian American Farmers Alliance are working to support Asian American farmers in providing culturally relevant foods for their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On campus, Anthropology Professor Nancy N. Chen&#8212;who studies the intersection of food, medicine, and culture&#8212;is also working with Matsushita-Tseng to develop a garden with traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. These efforts, in combination with a planned partnership between Matsushita-Tseng and the </span><a href="https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic Needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program in the fall, are important for building belonging and supporting student health, Chen says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every culture has its comfort foods, and fresh produce is something that is very specific to Asian cuisines,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So the opportunity to be able to have fresh and local vegetables that are unique to Asian foodways, that's a form of healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing through food can also include reclaiming lost connection to heritage. Many generations of Asian Americans have experienced loss of language, food customs, and other elements of culture due to violent assimilation forces, but Chen says some of that cultural knowledge can be restored.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lost food memories can be regrown similar to how you can actively make memories and grow food,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With the opportunity to save and recover heritage seeds or grow specific crops that are unique to a cultural foodway, the act of planting and cultivating that in a new landscape is a grounding experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, the genetics of heirloom Asian vegetables encode a cultural history passed down over generations. Each seed has a story to tell. And for today&#8217;s generation of Asian American farmers, sowing these seeds is a powerful act of remembrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like our seeds and our plants are as much our ancestors as our aunts and uncles,&#8221; Matsushita-Tseng said. &#8220;These plants carry with them memories of what our ancestors have experienced, from the taste preferences of their community, their stories, and the landscape and climate patterns. At its root, our work to preserve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">culture and community is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the strongest acts of resistance against white supremacy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work we're doing is about honoring and uplifting our community's legacy, as well as exploring what that means for folks of the Asian diaspora.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a4c7963e80727017480ce7268cdda082"><name>idea-hub</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>IDEA Hub finalists to pitch projects in June 2 showcase</title><summary>IDEA Hub finalists will pitch their projects in a June 2 showcase. </summary><start-date>1621926000000</start-date><display-name>IDEA Hub</display-name><path>/2021/05/idea-hub</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/idea-hub</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1621967214068</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1621973957241</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/idea-hub-flyer.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/idea-hub-flyer.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>idea-hub-flyer.jpg</name><display-name>idea-hub-flyer.jpg</display-name><file-size>74518</file-size><width>400</width><height>566</height></image><image-alt>Flier advertising the IDEA Hub contest</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Twenty-three teams will pitch their innovative work during a June 2 showcase as part of the annual IDEA Hub contest.&#160;</p>

Our planet Earth lives in an intermediate tropical zone well-suited to life. Planet hunters have long-wondered: Is this same type of planetary configuration common around other stars throughout our galaxy or are we unique?</p>
<p>The best way to find out is to do a census of the planetary denizens of the galaxy. Astronomers began such a census, called the California Legacy Survey, over three decades ago, and are now releasing a new batch of results. The project involves researchers at multiple institutions, including the University of California, California Institute of Technology, and University of Hawaii, and primarily uses three telescopes: The W. M. Keck Observatory atop Maunakea in Hawaii, and the Shane and Automated Planet Finder telescopes, both at Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very proud of the heritage of planet hunting which grew up around Lick Observatory and the Hamilton Spectrograph on the Shane telescope,&#8221; said Matthew Shetrone, deputy director of UC Observatories (UCO).</p>
<p>As the state of the art for exoplanet detection evolved, UCO brought new instruments to bear on the study of planets beyond our solar system, such as the fully robotic Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory and HIRES on the Keck Telescope. At the focus of these telescopes are the spectrographs, all of which were designed and built by Steve Vogt, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen entire generations of planet-hunting students come up through the UC system, such as Debra Fisher and Howard Isaacson,&#8221; Shetrone said. &#8220;The discovery of those first planets outside our solar system has launched an entire field of study, astrobiology, and nearly every UC campus has faculty in this exciting new field.</p>
<p>One pattern to emerge from the California Legacy Survey data is that giant planets tend to reside about 1 to 10 astronomical units (AU) from their host stars, a mostly icy region located beyond the temperate zone of a star. (An AU is defined as the distance from Earth to our sun, or about 93 million miles.) This is similar to what we see in our own solar system: Earth orbits at 1 AU; Jupiter is situated at about 5 AU and Saturn at 9 AU.</p>
<p>&#8220;We're starting to see patterns in other planetary systems that make our solar system look a bit more familiar,&#8221; said Caltech professor of astronomy Andrew Howard.</p>
<p>In our solar system, we also have planets that are a bit smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, which are located out beyond Saturn. The California Legacy Survey is not sensitive to planets in that size range and at that distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we can't detect smaller planets similar to Neptune and Uranus that are very distant from their stars, we can infer that the large gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are extremely rare in the outermost regions of most exoplanetary systems,&#8221; explained BJ Fulton, a staff scientist at Caltech's IPAC astronomy center.</p>
<p>The new research is reported in two articles accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Supplement</em>. UC Santa Cruz graduate student Molly Kosiarek is a coauthor of both papers. Caltech graduate student Lee Rosenthal is lead author of one study, and Fulton is lead author of the second paper.</p>
<p>In the early days of planet hunting, back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was not clear whether planets that orbit other stars, called exoplanets, were lined up in a similar fashion to our solar system, with small rocky planets in the interior and giant planets in the outer regions, or if the opposite may be true. In fact, evidence began to accumulate that exoplanets did not share our same architecture as more and more giant, blistering planets, known as "hot Jupiters," were discovered orbiting very closely to their stars.</p>
<p>Because hot Jupiters whip tightly around their stars, and because they are massive, they can be easily detected using the radial velocity planet-hunting method, in which the "wobble" of a star is detected as a planet circles around and tugs on the star, pulling it back and forth.</p>
<p>To obtain a more complete picture of other star systems, astronomers needed more time. The outer planets take much longer journeys around their stars; just one tug on a star can last decades. For reference, Jupiter laps our sun every 12 years, while Saturn ambles along at an even slower pace and completes one orbit every 29 years.</p>
<p>That is where the California Legacy Survey comes in. It has been observing 719 sun-like stars for more than three decades, and as such, is the longest-duration exoplanet survey to date. Among the stars searched in the project, 177 planets were found, including 14 that are newly discovered. The planets have masses between one-hundredth and 20 times the mass of Jupiter (or between about 3 and 6,000 Earth masses). As of now, ground-based telescopes are not sensitive enough to detect planets the mass of Earth or smaller.</p>
<p>One pattern to emerge is the tendency for giant planets to reside between 1 and 10 AU from their star. While the team's data does not fully cover regions beyond 10 AU, because those planets require even more than three decades to complete an orbit, they say that they can make inferences based on the partial orbits observed thus far.</p>
<p>The team plans to continue to search their census data for new patterns and clues to help understand the characteristics and formation of other star systems, as well as our own solar system. They are also looking forward to next-generation surveys.</p>
<p>"This survey is a great jumping-off point for future instruments that are sensitive to planets the size of Earth," said Howard, who is leading one such instrument, the Keck Planet Finder, expected to be shipped to Keck in Hawaii in 2022.</p>
<p>The California Legacy Survey is funded and supported by Caltech, the University of California, the University of Hawaii, Tennessee State University, NASA, the National Science Foundation, the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, Google, and Ken and Gloria Levy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a996494980727017480ce726be3a4507"><name>original-nations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Visualizing global representation for Indigenous nations  </title><summary>A new book by Professor of Sociology and Legal Studies Hiroshi Fukurai shows how Indigenous “original nations” around the world are fighting for sovereignty and the ecological preservation of their ancestral homelands. &#13;

<p><a href="https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030592721"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original Nation Approaches to Inter-National Law</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">re-examines global politics and the history of regional conflicts from the perspective of Indigenous peoples, whose traditional homelands have often been subdivided or combined as colonial empires shaped the states on today&#8217;s world map. The book also considers new approaches to global governance that could help to reclaim rights for equitable representation in global politics by Indigenous nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fukurai&#8217;s book was influenced by his almost 20 years of teaching in international law, which includes an emphasis on regional conflicts across the globe. He has also conducted extensive research on law and politics in Asia and Indigenous approaches to law. Fukurai himself is originally from Northern Japan, where his ancestors share roots with the Ainu Indigenous people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese government only began to recognize the country&#8217;s multiple ethnic groups in 2008. Elsewhere in Asia, Indigenous nations were captured and partitioned across multiple states in the post-colonial period, fueling brutal modern-day conflict in places like the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Kashmir region, which includes parts of India, Pakistan, and China. Fukurai says the concept of original nations and their historical struggles against the state system is key to understanding these issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You simply cannot look at international relations only from the state-centric perspective,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You have to look into those internal dynamics within and across the state system. It provides a very different portrait of today's world when you analyze historical tensions between the original nations that have existed for thousands of years, compared to the state system, which came into being only in the last 200 to 300 years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fukurai has also studied settler-colonial processes in the United States, where governments pursued a policy of genocide and disenfranchisement against Indigenous nations over the course of many centuries. And Fukurai says this &#8220;simultaneous process of state-making and nation-destroying&#8221; is still taking place around the globe today.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in many modern states, Indigenous nations are fighting for rights, recognition, and sovereignty. These efforts are typically not recognized by the international community. But in 2007, the United Nations&#8212;which is composed of 193 member states&#8212;adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which established a universal framework of standards for human rights and freedoms for Indigenous peoples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fukurai said enforcement mechanisms are now needed to ensure these rights under the U.N. framework. Additionally, he believes there are opportunities within international law to fundamentally and cognitively reimagine state systems for the future in a way that could be transformed to serve the interest of all people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The state system is what we call a legal fiction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Humans have the cognitive capacity to change and redefine it. We gave life into these fictional entities, and we can reconstruct them into a more amenable form so that their rights are not above the rights of humans or even non-human species.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Islam</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest book from Politics and Legal Studies Professor Mark Fathi Massoud, </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sharia-inshallah/AFF6E3D685A2D940E834BDA4F9431617"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges Western notions of Islam and secular law-making by revealing the many ways in which Somali Muslims have embraced Sharia, a system of Islamic religious rules.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western democracies tend to carefully guard separation of church and state, but in many predominantly Muslim countries, a majority of Muslims say they want to be governed by Sharia. Massoud, a human rights lawyer, sought to understand why. So he took a closer look at Somalia, a country where 99 percent of the population are Sunni Muslims.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somalia is perhaps best known for its struggles with piracy, terrorism, famine, and civil war, but the region&#8212;which includes the self-declared independent state of Somaliland&#8212;also provides an example of the diversity of ways in which Sharia has been interpreted and applied throughout history. Dictators and European colonial administrators used Sharia to justify their power, but Somalis have also invoked the Quran, Islam&#8217;s holy book and a primary source of Sharia, to resist oppressors, expel warlords, fight for gender equality, and build a path to the rule of law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People are reinterpreting, reasserting, and reclaiming the sources of Sharia&#8212;whether they want to oppress, or whether they want to progress,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;My book is an antidote to those who see religion as an obstacle to peace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> documents these findings through Massoud&#8217;s historical research and extensive field work in East Africa. He also studied theology for a year in order to better understand the underpinnings of Islamic, Christian, and Jewish faiths. Massoud was raised Catholic in California after his family fled a dictatorship in Sudan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internationally, Sharia is often portrayed as a tool of oppression or violent extremism, but Massoud&#8217;s book includes many examples of Sharia as a force for liberation. Perhaps the most striking is the work of modern Somali women&#8217;s rights activists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud spoke with many women who said that organizations like the United Nations communicate about women&#8217;s rights in ways that do not resonate with Somalis. Activists within the country have found that one of the most effective ways to create meaningful change is through the lens of Sharia. Rather than emphasizing legal rights under international law, Somali activists focus on teaching how equality for women is compatible with the principles of Islam. Massoud says this is an important lesson for the international community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a disconnect between how international lawyers are thinking about human rights and how the people for whom human rights matter most are thinking about it,&#8221; Massoud explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about what the law says. It&#8217;s about how God&#8217;s will requires political leaders to protect the rights of women, minorities, and refugees. For some people, God means much more than a constitution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also demonstrates the importance of religious moral authority by recounting how ocean robberies declined when religious leaders spoke out against piracy. Activists have also used Islam to bring about environmental protections. Massoud said these and many other examples from the book demonstrate how, in Somalia and Somaliland, &#8220;the rule of law and the rule of God are not on a collision course; they could actually be swinging in the same direction.&#8221; And this relationship between law and religion has many parallels in American history.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During so much of the state-building process in the United States, judges saw Christianity as part of the common law, which gave the legal system legitimacy,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;Religion is the unseen foundation of the law, and religious systems can be interpreted in a variety of ways, just like legal systems.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s insights demonstrate how Sharia, like any form of religion or law, can be used to either uphold or struggle against systems of oppression.

<h3>2021 Irwin Scholars Talk About Exhibition</h3>
<p><a href="https://artofchange.ucsc.edu/episodes/the-2021-irwin-scholars-talk-about-their-exhibition-fabricating-solace">Listen</a> to the 2021 Irwin Scholars talk about the personal challenges of studying and working remotely, while also trying to create work for a virtual exhibition during a pandemic.</p>
</div>
<p><span>Twelve of UCSC's most promising artists will have their work on display in the 35th annual Irwin Scholarship exhibition, beginning June 3, at The Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span>Titled <i>IRWIN 2021: Fabricating Solace</i>, the show explores the art of creating comfort in response to unprecedented hardships and isolation generated by the pandemic over the past year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>It includes a variety of approaches to the practice of contemporary art, including painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture, video installation, stop-motion animation, artist&#8217;s books, and performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;<i>Fabricating Solace</i> means a break from exhaustion,&#8221; noted Irwin scholar Abby McPhillips. &#8220;It&#8217;s finding a space to disconnect from life&#8217;s ongoing stress and restore balance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>And while the aim of the show is to examine &#8220;fabric&#8221; as a metaphor for connection and collectivity, it also takes a look at the often insincere implications of the world &#8220;fabricate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The past year has been very isolating, and each one of us has had to create our own comfort even just to tread water,&#8221; explained Chloe Calhoun. &#8220;To fabricate can also mean to falsify, and when everything seems to be falling apart, the day-to-day rituals that are normally reassuring can seem like rather flimsy lies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>"This scholarship highlights </strong>the work of art students at UCSC as they navigated unexpected social events that included wildfires and a global pandemic,&#8221; noted associate art professor and Irwin faculty advisor Karolina Karlic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to showcase the resilience of our students at this time and the work they have produced under such radical circumstances, as they gained knowledge of new materials and produced art in new environments."<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <i>William Hyde And Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund</i> was established in 1986 by the late Sue Irwin, in honor of her husband, as a way of ensuring that others would have the kind of art education that allowed her to flourish in the art community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Scholarships are granted each year to 12 outstanding UC Santa Cruz students, selected for their academic excellence, creativity, and potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The Irwin Scholars have been examining what it means to construct comfort in an uncertain world by paying attention to self-care, and confronting issues that matter in their lives today,&#8221; said Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;In our virtual exhibition, the visitor will encounter works that examine gender identity, environmental responsibilities, photographic murals with links to virtual hubs for further exploration, and animation videos with 3D-rendered furniture for you to imagine sitting on."</span></p>
<p><span>These works will be shown virtually through a 3D model of the Sesnon Gallery and accessible online, 24/7. This virtual model was designed by Digital Arts and New Media Technical Coordinator, Colleen Jennings, using an architectural software program called SketchUp. All digital showings are free and open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>"The current Irwin scholars have weathered the shock of the pandemic in 2020, the ongoing dilemmas of remote learning, lack of adequate studio space, and now are just feeling a hint of light reopening at the end of the tunnel to complete their arts degree,&#8221; said Graham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;After 22 years of directing the Sesnon Art Gallery, I&#160;am impressed with the quality of work each year, and the 2021 Irwin Scholars have given us all hope for the future,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>__________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>

<p>Larissa Mangas, the clinic director at UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center, faced all of that last year. Mangas arrived at her new job having recently injured her foot and wearing a walking boot. Just two days after she started her position March 9, 2020, the campus shifted to remote operations due to COVID&#8211;19 restrictions. Five months after that, she and her husband and pets were suddenly evacuated in the middle of the night because of wildfire. While her home was saved, her three immediate neighbors&#8217; houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first few months were a whirlwind for sure,&#8221; Mangas said.</p>
<p>Mangas moved from Long Beach in January and was just starting to settle in when she began her new job. After the shutdowns, she had to jump into action to help get telehealth services started at the student health center. The office had never offered telephone appointments for patients before and the process would have normally taken a solid year to get off the ground. &#8220;We got it done in less than two months,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The next big challenge was getting COVID&#8211;19 testing going last summer. She and others had to figure out how to coordinate all the logistics including setting up a site in a parking lot, figuring out patient scheduling, coordinating with the Molecular Diagnostic Lab, which processed the tests, and integrating testing into their electronic medical record.</p>
<p>Mangas said she never worried about her or other health workers&#8217; safety from COVID&#8211;19 at the university because the student health center always had enough supply of personal protective equipment like masks, gowns and gloves. In addition, she didn&#8217;t work much with patients directly and was working more on administrative tasks.</p>
<p>What was much more difficult was trying to follow the constantly changing guidance about how to manage the disease. One day she would train nurses in COVID&#8211;19 protocols. &#8220;The next day, the guidance changed and we had to change everything we did,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That happened over and over the first few months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The August wildfire presented more upheaval. One night at 1 a.m., Mangas and her husband had to leave their home with their pets to flee approaching flames. They spent that first night sleeping in their truck in the Student Health Center parking lot. They later moved to a hotel with their cat, dog and a rabbit and left three ducks to board at an animal shelter.</p>
<p>Coping with the unknown was hard. They didn&#8217;t know how long they would have to evacuate or if they would lose the house. She thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only lived here eight months and I might lose all my belongings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mangas was touched by the outpouring of support from her new colleagues at work who checked in on her and offered to provide space for her animals. It was hard for her to meet anybody else outside of work because of the pandemic restrictions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the new challenge was figuring out how to distribute the new COVID&#8211;19 vaccines. It was Mangas&#8217; job to set up the clinics.</p>
<p>Beginning in January, the university offered vaccinations to the student health center staff first and then offered shots up to the greater campus community including faculty, staff, student workers and other affiliates. She set up vaccination sites at a COVID testing kiosk on campus, went to the daycare center to vaccinate staff there, and then set up the clinic at the Cowell Hay Barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a large demand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There was a time when people were calling us trying to get in and we were full and we didn&#8217;t have the vaccine or capacity for everyone calling us,&#8221; she said. Later on, it became easier to serve everyone.</p>
<p>But even in the most difficult time, the vaccination process moved smoothly. &#8220;People did not have to wait hours and hours,&#8221; she said, as was the case in some locations around the country. &#8220;Maybe the longest wait in line was 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All in all, the university provided 5,200 vaccines through April.</p>
<p>Now, at last, things seem to be settling down and Mangas is busy preparing for fall and what is hoped to be the full return of students to campus. She is grateful that she can go back to focusing on the core operations of the student health center. &#8220;I can breathe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m able to focus on doing the rest of my job now.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b020dfb480727017480ce726001e91b9"><name>hate-speech</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Instances of hate speech and expression in student spaces</title><summary>All members of our community have a responsibility to uphold our Principles of Community whenever they engage in speech and expression.</summary><start-date>1622098800000</start-date><display-name>Instances of hate speech and expression in student spaces</display-name><path>/2021/05/hate-speech</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/hate-speech</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1622157614989</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1622157614989</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over the past few weeks, we have all watched the escalating Israel-Gaza violence with growing horror at the destruction and death inflicted on civilians and children. We join those hoping the brokered cease-fire holds and that a peaceful and dignified solution that honors human life and rights can be found.</p>
<p>Tuesday night, charged debate on the topic unfolded at a student meeting. An unusually large number of people attended the session, including many non-affiliates of campus. After reviewing documentation from the meeting, it is clear that hateful language was used against individual students and community members.</p>
<p>This unacceptable behavior appears to have taken the form of a &#8220;Zoom bombing&#8221; by parties not affiliated with the university that took advantage of an open meeting to inflict harm in a community space.</p>

This five-year appointment begins on July 1st and will provide Holl with funding for her work to increase the effectiveness of forest restoration efforts in combating climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly honored to receive this award and to be recognized as a MacArthur Foundation Chair,&#8221; Holl said. &#8220;Forest restoration and increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes are an important part of climate solutions, but so far, they generally haven&#8217;t been done well. My work aims to develop and share scientific guidance so we can do it much better and make this a more successful part of the solution.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl is an ecologist who has studied how to restore tropical and temperate forests for nearly three decades. In recent years, tree-planting campaigns have gained popularity as a &#8220;natural climate solution&#8221; because plants absorb carbon dioxide, which is one of the heat-trapping gasses that have built up in excess around our planet due to human activities like the burning of fossil fuels. But Holl knows there are limits to what trees can do to help.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s collaborating with conservation organizations and climate advocates to appropriately plan and care for forest restoration projects so that trees can be effective in storing as much carbon dioxide as possible in the long term. When done well, tree-planting provides a whole host of benefits for people and the planet. But without proper planning, there can actually be unintended negative consequences. And Holl wants to see more focus on preserving existing ecosystems, since it&#8217;s easier to protect a healthy forest or grassland than to restore one that has been lost.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most importantly, Holl wants people to understand that trees can&#8217;t restore balance to our planet&#8217;s carbon cycle all on their own; we must also dramatically reduce the amount of excess carbon dioxide we&#8217;re emitting. The MacArthur Foundation Chair appointment will help Holl and her network of collaborators communicate important messages like these. Some of the funding will support undergraduate and graduate students in producing short videos and research summaries to share restoration science lessons with key decision-makers and the general public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will also support Holl and her graduate students in continuing their research on forest restoration strategies with partners in Costa Rica, Columbia, Ecuador, and Brazil. Graduate students will also work with undergraduates to document global best practices by analyzing case studies of prior forest restoration projects.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited for all aspects of this project,&#8221; Holl said. &#8220;Graduate students are so critical to our work, so to have funding for them to go to Latin America and enable those interactions and that exchange of learning with our collaborators is exciting. The outreach skills and networking opportunities they will gain through this project are important, since many of my students go on to work with conservation organizations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl will be UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s second recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Chair award, and she&#8217;ll be the first winner from the Social Sciences Division. The MacArthur Foundation originally established an endowment in 1981 to support a chair position that would rotate among the University of California campuses. That endowment has since generated seven systemwide chairs that rotate among the UC campuses in five-year increments. UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive awarded Holl the chair position on behalf of the university. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c85a21ba80727017480ce726f9bfabe6"><name>salary-increase-questions-criteria</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Policy-covered employee salary increase for 2021-22; questions and criteria</title><summary>All eligible policy-covered staff will be receiving a 3% across the board, general salary increase in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. </summary><start-date>1622185200000</start-date><display-name>Policy-covered employee salary increase for 2021-22; questions and criteria</display-name><path>/2021/05/salary-increase-questions-criteria</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/05/salary-increase-questions-criteria</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1622564020630</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1622564020630</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As previously announced by Chancellor Larive on May 14, 2021, all eligible policy-covered staff will be receiving a 3% across the board, general salary increase in the 2021-2022 fiscal year.
