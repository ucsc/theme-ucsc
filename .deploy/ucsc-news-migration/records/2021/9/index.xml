That may soon change with the construction of a small pond designed to enhance an existing seasonal wetland and provide potential breeding habitat for the native frog.</p>
<p>The wetland enhancement project will be located near the railroad corridor in the upper terrace area of the Coastal Science Campus, north of McAllister Way, and it is within the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve. Construction is expected to begin in mid-September and will be followed by replanting of the area to restore native vegetation around the pond.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project fits in seamlessly with our restoration program for the terrace lands that are now part of the reserve,&#8221; said Elizabeth Howard, director of Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve. &#8220;The enhanced habitat will also create new opportunities for research, education, and outreach activities around the California red-legged frog.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP) for the Coastal Science Campus approved by the California Coastal Commission in 2009, 47 acres of terrace lands were added to the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve. The terrace lands had been farmed for nearly 70 years, and the reserve&#8217;s restoration efforts include removing non-native invasive plants, restoring native plants, creating more diverse habitats, and protecting and enhancing wetland areas.</p>
<p>The upper terrace wetland enhancement project will create an area for water to pool seasonally and remain longer on the site. It is designed to rely on existing natural water sources, including rainfall and surface runoff, with no permanent structures to add or remove water, and will continue to naturally drain towards Younger Lagoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to enhance and restore the natural hydrology of the site,&#8221; said UCSC Natural Reserves Director Gage Dayton.</p>
<p>The campus has explored the potential for improving aquatic habitat for the California red-legged frog in the upper terrace as part of a suite of Coastal Science Campus projects since 2014. The restoration project has been made possible through a partnership between UCSC, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County (RCD). Construction costs are being funded by the USFWS Local Coastal Program and RCD, which is overseeing the design and construction of the pond, while UCSC is responsible for replanting and ongoing maintenance as part of the reserve&#8217;s wetland restoration program.</p>
<p>The restoration program involves many UCSC students, who will be helping to collect seeds and propagate native plants, plant the site after construction of the pond, and monitor and maintain it over the years. &#8220;The enhanced wetland will also create new opportunities for students to do research projects and have learning experiences up close with this protected species,&#8221; Howard said.</p>
<p>The California red-legged frog uses both aquatic and upland habitats. Dayton said adult red-legged frogs have been found in the upper terrace area for a long time. For successful breeding, however, the frogs require ponds or other aquatic habitat. The eggs are laid in water and the larvae (tadpoles) remain in the water until they mature into adult frogs. The adults then move into terrestrial habitat for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that frogs have been moving onto the reserve from nearby aquatic habitat sites and then going back during the breeding season,&#8221; Dayton said. &#8220;The native plant restoration work we&#8217;ve been doing is creating better terrestrial upland habitat for the frogs, and we hope that the upper terrace wetland enhancement project will create successful aquatic breeding habitat which would then be connected to other breeding populations in the area. It&#8217;s another piece of the puzzle that not only helps our goals for the reserve but can also help this threatened species.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a28274c0807270466cc00b00910825f2"><name>touching-stars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers create the first 3D-printed stellar nurseries</title><summary>Researchers can now hold stellar nurseries in their hands thanks to 3D printing, revealing features often obscured in traditional renderings and animations.</summary><keywords>Nia Imara</keywords><start-date>1630566000000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers create the first 3D-printed stellar nurseries</display-name><path>/2021/09/touching-stars</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/touching-stars</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1630519063727</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1630594090540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/spheres-group-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/spheres-group-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spheres-group-500.jpg</name><display-name>spheres-group-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>102300</file-size><width>500</width><height>563</height></image><image-alt>group of spheres against black background</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/spheres-group-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/spheres-group-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spheres-group-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>spheres-group-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19110</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>polished sphere against black background</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The first 3D-printed stellar nurseries are highly polished spheres about the size of a baseball, in which swirling clumps and filaments represent star-forming clouds of gas and dust.

<p>Imara and her collaborators created the models using data from simulations of star-forming clouds and a sophisticated 3D printing process in which the fine-scale densities and gradients of the turbulent clouds are embedded in a transparent resin. The resulting models&#8212;the first 3D-printed stellar nurseries&#8212;are highly polished spheres about the size of a baseball (8 centimeters in diameter), in which the star-forming material appears as swirling clumps and filaments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted an interactive object to help us visualize those structures where stars form so we can better understand the physical processes,&#8221; said Imara, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper describing this novel approach <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac194e">published August 25 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>.</p>
<p>An artist as well as an astrophysicist, Imara said the idea is an example of science imitating art. &#8220;Years ago, I sketched a portrait of myself touching a star. Later, the idea just clicked. Star formation within molecular clouds is my area of expertise, so why not try to build one?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She worked with coauthor John Forbes at the Flatiron Institute&#8217;s Center for Computational Astrophysics to develop a suite of nine simulations representing different physical conditions within molecular clouds. The collaboration also included coauthor James Weaver at Harvard University&#8217;s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who helped to turn the data from the astronomical simulations into physical objects using high-resolution and photo-realistic multi-material 3D printing.</p>
<p>The results are both visually striking and scientifically illuminating. &#8220;Just aesthetically they are really amazing to look at, and then you begin to notice the complex structures that are incredibly difficult to see with the usual techniques for visualizing these simulations,&#8221; Forbes said.</p>
<p>For example, sheet-like or pancake-shaped structures are hard to distinguish in two-dimensional slices or projections, because a section through a sheet looks like a filament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within the spheres, you can clearly see a two-dimensional sheet, and inside it are little filaments, and that&#8217;s mind boggling from the perspective of someone who is trying to understand what&#8217;s going on in these simulations,&#8221; Forbes said.</p>
<p>The models also reveal structures that are more continuous than they would appear in 2D projections, Imara said. &#8220;If you have something winding around through space, you might not realize that two regions are connected by the same structure, so having an interactive object you can rotate in your hand allows us to detect these continuities more easily,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The nine simulations on which the models are based were designed to investigate the effects of three fundamental physical processes that govern the evolution of molecular clouds: turbulence, gravity, and magnetic fields. By changing different variables, such as the strength of the magnetic fields or how fast the gas is moving, the simulations show how different physical environments affect the morphology of substructures related to star formation.</p>
<p>Stars tend to form in clumps and cores located at the intersection of filaments, where the density of gas and dust becomes high enough for gravity to take over. &#8220;We think that the spins of these newborn stars will depend on the structures in which they form&#8212;stars in the same filament will &#8216;know&#8217; about each other&#8217;s spins,&#8221; Imara said.</p>
<p>With the physical models, it doesn&#8217;t take an astrophysicist with expertise in these processes to see the differences between the simulations. &#8220;When I looked at 2D projections of the simulation data, it was often challenging to see their subtle differences, whereas with the 3D-printed models, it was obvious,&#8221; said Weaver, who has a background in biology and materials science and routinely uses 3D printing to investigate the structural details of a wide range of biological and synthetic materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in exploring the interface between science, art, and education, and I&#8217;m passionate about using 3D printing as a tool for the presentation of complex structures and processes in an easily understandable fashion,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;Traditional extrusion-based 3D printing can only produce solid objects with a continuous outer surface, and that&#8217;s problematic when trying to depict, gases, clouds, or other diffuse forms. Our approach uses an inkjet-like 3D printing process to deposit tiny individual droplets of opaque resin at precise locations within a surrounding volume of transparent resin to define the cloud's form in exquisite detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that in the future the models could also incorporate additional information through the use of different colors to increase their scientific value. The researchers are also interested in exploring the use of 3D printing to represent observational data from nearby molecular clouds, such as those in the constellation Orion.</p>
<p>The models can also serve as valuable tools for education and public outreach, said Imara, who plans to use them in an astrophysics course she will be teaching this fall.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a363114b807270466cc00b00750e8bb2"><name>campus-safety-first-steps</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First steps in re-envisioned approach to campus safety</title><summary>Today we share information about a number of the steps our campus is taking, or will be taking soon, in this continuing effort.</summary><start-date>1630479600000</start-date><display-name>First steps in re-envisioned approach to campus safety</display-name><path>/2021/09/campus-safety-first-steps</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/campus-safety-first-steps</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1630533783866</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1630533783866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over the past year, our campus community has sought to re-envision its approach to public safety, with the aim of creating a campus policing structure that supports our students, staff and faculty while also helping to create a campus climate where all communities feel welcomed, respected, and protected. Today we share information about a number of the steps our campus is taking, or will be taking soon, in this continuing effort.</p>
<p>As part of this new framework, we are reducing the size of our Police Department from our budgeted 32 sworn officer positions. Based on our current campus population, we believe that we need a minimum of 24 sworn police officers for the safety of our campus community. We will maintain our commitment to rapid emergency response at our residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, and Westside Research Park even with fewer sworn officers. We will share information about opportunities for campus engagement in the officer hiring process when a search is underway.</p>
<p>This change in police staffing requires shifts in responsibility, changes to a range of university functions, and a shared approach to community safety that engages many more people on our campus. The changes we are undertaking are informed by stakeholder feedback at both the campus and system level, and are ongoing. They are also informed by recommendations of the UC Santa Cruz Campus Safety Community Advisory Board and from the UC Office of the President, which earlier this month released the final version of its <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/community-safety-plan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630617830509000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZMmqCuQ1P1uTmQtLsA3SW_xCATQ" href="https://www.ucop.edu/community-safety-plan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 UC Community Safety Plan</a>. President Drake has advocated for a tiered public-safety model that involves repurposing existing sworn officer positions to other safety, wellness or social-service roles, and the responsibility adjustments we are implementing align with that tiered response. Each of these changes is considered a pilot program that will require campus engagement and feedback to refine and continue to improve our approach to campus safety.</p>
<p>The steps we are taking are wide-ranging and will take time to implement. The earliest we anticipate most changes occurring is winter quarter 2022, which will provide time for input and refinement. Parking enforcement, for instance, will no longer be handled by campus police but by Transportation and Parking Services. We also expect to implement new models for traffic control as opposed to relying solely on campus police. Officers will continue to be responsible for the enforcement of traffic laws on campus, safeguarding pedestrians, bicyclists and other motorists by issuing tickets to motorists who speed or roll through a stop sign, for example.</p>
<p>Campus working groups are currently forming to map out how we can move other functions currently performed by uniformed officers to other units. Among the duties being discussed: security at major campus events and requests for assistance from employees who find themselves locked out of buildings or offices. Part of this work will entail examining how programs such as our Community Safety Officer Program can be expanded or adapted to support these critical needs.</p>
<p>A campus-based &#8220;Sobering Station&#8221; for intoxicated students is in the works. It will provide students a facility where they feel comfortable seeking help should they need it, and staff there can help ensure students don&#8217;t harm themselves or others.</p>
<p>President Drake&#8217;s UC Community Safety Plan also calls for a primarily mental-health response to student mental-health crisis situations. A campus workgroup is developing plans to institute this important change by spring quarter 2022.</p>
<p>These are just a handful of the changes being planned in response to systemwide and campus recommendations. All are intended to expand our definition of safety and recognize that multiple units across campus &#8212; outside of our campus Police Department &#8212; have a role to play in safety and wellness. As a whole, these steps will allow our police to focus on the key elements of safety and protection that they are best suited to support.</p>
<p>These adjustments are not the end of our efforts. We are working diligently to create a public-safety framework that is inclusive of our entire community.

But insights from psychology research could help to maximize learning, even in limited study time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Psychology Hannah Hausman collaborated with colleagues at Colorado State University on an </span><a href="https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/2151-2604/a000440"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that translates findings from more than 100 research papers to offer students and teachers a guiding framework and practical tips for making the most of study time. These recommendations also address common pitfalls associated with the study process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In order to use study time effectively, you need to know what to study, and that's the content that you still don't understand yet,&#8221; said Hausman. &#8220;That may seem kind of obvious, but research shows that people actually aren't as good at figuring out what they know and don't know as you might think they would be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, many studies have shown that learners are consistently overconfident in their understanding of content from classes, particularly when they are able to easily follow along with instruction, or if they feel familiar with the concepts. But recalling, explaining, or recognizing examples of those same concepts later on during testing is a very different situation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To study effectively, students need to more closely match how they self-assess their learning to the actual conditions under which they&#8217;ll be tested. But this doesn&#8217;t seem to happen naturally, even for students with a lot of test-taking experience. That&#8217;s where psychology-based study frameworks can help. Hausman and her coauthors recommend a three-step process called &#8220;wait-generate-validate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in this framework, wait, means students should hold off on making any judgments about their learning until the content is no longer fresh in their minds from their initial exposure. This is crucial because tests will evaluate long-term learning and understanding, rather than short-term memory. The second step, generate, means that studying should focus on active recall and application of information, rather than passive review of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What most people do when they study is immediately take out their notes or rewatch lecture videos, but what you want to do instead is get out a blank sheet of paper and try to write out the five main points from the previous lecture, or try doing any homework problems from memory first,&#8221; Hausman said. &#8220;That way, you&#8217;ll see what you know and don't know, and then you can go look at your notes for extra help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers can incorporate active study strategies into classroom activities too, and it&#8217;s important to pair this approach with a time delay, Hausman says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teachers will often ask a few questions at the end of the day to make sure students understood the lecture, but that's actually not the right time to check in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What we should do is wait until the next lecture and start with questions to see what students remember from the previous class, rather than reminding them of that content during review.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers can make generation the default form of review in their classrooms and should aim to offer activities that match the format of the test as closely as possible, the article says. Another key is to have all students participate in the generation process, rather than just a few volunteers. These strategies should always be paired with the third step in the framework, &#8220;validate&#8221;, which means checking in on whether student answers are complete and correct.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hausman says students often have a hard time figuring out on their own if their answers are accurate, so teachers should point out areas for improvement. Textbooks can also provide concrete answers, with strong explanations, for each review question they offer. But it&#8217;s important for review questions to always include a reminder for students to try to answer on their own first before checking answers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can be a tricky balancing act, and in online learning, it&#8217;s an area of emerging research. Many online learning programs offer options for students to click to receive hints while working on practice questions. But Hausman says students will often click through all of the hints right away to get to the answers, and this could reduce the effectiveness of their studying.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Hausman hopes that, if students know the basics of the wait-generate-validate model, it might help shift their approach to studying in a way that maximizes learning benefit without consuming more time out of their already busy lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students shouldn&#8217;t be intimidated by these recommendations or worry that it's going to be a ton of work to change how they study,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These are really just small tweaks that can make a big difference.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

pandemic-related genomic data analysis efforts for the public good</article-subhead><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz is drawing on its expertise in genomics and data sharing to lead a new, state-sponsored public health program. In an agreement signed August 18, 2021, UCSC will develop tools designed to benefit California residents by overlaying SARS-CoV-2 genomic data with public health information. </span></p>
<p><span>This approach will let public health officials use genomic data to identify how a virus evolves, and then where and when its variants spread in an outbreak. This undertaking promises to help the state contain the spread of viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by rapidly and accurately changing public health policies and practices to control the spread of infection. </span></p>
<p><span>UCSC&#8217;s strength in bioinformatics&#8212;an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software for understanding complex biological datasets&#8212;will be tapped to fuel a pathogen genomics program, a specialization set to become a cornerstone for tackling future outbreaks of communicable disease. </span></p>
<p><span>A pathogen genomics program analyzing the genetic codes of dangerous viruses, bacteria, or other microbes in our community offers public health officials a powerful tool to help prevent outbreaks. The field of pathogen genomics has risen to unprecedented prominence during the pandemic as public health experts scramble to translate SARS-CoV-2 DNA data into public policy.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We expect the impact of this work to last far beyond the current public health crisis,&#8221; explained UCSC Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Russ Corbett-Detig, who is a co-principal investigator for UCSC&#8217;s contract. </span></p>
<p><span>UCSC has long been a leader in genomics, and has demonstrated a strong public commitment to data sharing dating back to its involvement in the Human Genome Project twenty years ago, when then graduate student Jim Kent and his mentor David Haussler assembled and published the draft human genome to the internet for free. Kent and fellow UCSC researchers went on to create the UCSC Genome Browser, a free search engine that allows researchers to peer into the details of genetic code.</span></p>
<p><span>The Browser has since become a staple for molecular research. With each new global outbreak of infectious diseases, a growing section of the Genome Browser has become dedicated to the genomes of dangerous pathogens.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;When there has been an urgent, international epidemic situation, we&#8217;ve stepped in and used our capabilities of building genome browsers to help with it,&#8221; said Haussler, who now serves as the Scientific Director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</span></p>
<p><span>When COVID-19 reached Santa Cruz in early 2020, a group of UCSC professors converted a research space into a COVID-19 testing site and sidelined their main research to help with local testing and sequencing efforts. The testing lab has since become foundational to UCSC&#8217;s strategy to help the greater Santa Cruz community stay ahead of the pandemic and keep it at bay.</span></p>
<p><span>Key components of the platform that UCSC will deliver to the state are: the testing lab, now proven in its ability to deliver fast, accurate test results; a growing team dedicated to sequencing the positive cases; the Virus Browser itself; and a new Browser feature designed to maximize its ability to visually display the ocean of genomic data the lab generates. Those responsible for delivering the platform are UCSC faculty members David Haussler, Russell Corbett-Detig, and Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology A. Marm Kilpatrick. </span></p>
<p><span>Corbett-Detig is particularly excited about the Browser feature that allows an epidemiologist, using their own secure computer, to view public health information visually overlaid on an evolutionary&#8212;or phylogenetic&#8212;tree inferring how genomes were transmitted from one person to another.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;One of the things that the phylogenetic tree can do is to create a link between cases that weren&#8217;t obviously connected,&#8221; says Corbett-Detig. &#8220;That tells us something about the likely source of infection and so who to follow up with first for contact tracing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Haussler stresses that to do this, the UCSC team will not be using patient information, just virus genomes. But the program will allow public health experts to use virus genomes to track who is catching the virus and how. With the help of Corbett-Detig&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e2.htm?s_cid=mm7035e2_e">analysis</a>, health officials in Marin County were recently able to trace transmission from a teacher to more than half of their class, as reported in the <em>New York Times</em> (&#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/health/coronavirus-schools-children.html">How the Delta Variant Infiltrated an Elementary School Classroom</a>&#8221;) and numerous other news outlets.</span></p>
<p><span>While ensuring its tools are both effective and secure, the team will deliver a final product designed to help shepherd California out of the current pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>Corbett-Detig noted that the shelf life of the program will extend beyond COVID because it can prepare us for future pandemics, and it can help public health efforts on well known infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The software can work on just about any pathogen,&#8221; he asserts. </span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/coronavirus-variants.html</url><title>New tools enable rapid analysis of coronavirus sequences and tracking of variants</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-county-partnership.html</url><title>County, UCSC partner to expand local testing capacity</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ac3d74fb807270466cc00b004af79986"><name>vaccine-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Critically important: UC Vaccine Policy compliance required by Sept. 9</title><summary>We are writing today to describe the steps you can take to get your fall quarter off to a strong start.</summary><start-date>1630566000000</start-date><display-name>Critically important: UC Vaccine Policy compliance required by Sept. 9</display-name><path>/2021/09/vaccine-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/vaccine-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1630682313954</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662580951996</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are excited to have you back on the UC Santa Cruz campus this fall.

If you don't do both or have a request for exception on file by Sept. 9, you are not considered compliant. It's super easy, takes about a minute, and you can do it right on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Unvaccinated students who have filed a request for exception</strong> will be required to have a COVID test upon arrival to campus and every four days following their arrival. These students will be required to sequester for seven days after arriving on campus, interacting minimally with other persons while strictly observing all COVID spread mitigation precautions.</p>
<p><strong>Unvaccinated students who have not filed a request for exception</strong> are not allowed on campus after the Sept. 9 deadline. They will not be allowed to move into an on-campus residential assignment if they have one, attend classes or attend any other business on site.</p>
<h1>Compliance for Partially Vaccinated Students</h1>
<p>If you only have one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine on file, or it hasn't been two weeks since your second dose when you arrive on campus, you will still be considered non-compliant. If you are a residential student, you will be permitted to move in after Sept. 9 but must sequester and be tested twice per week until compliant. You must also have proof of a test within 72 hours of move-in <strong>OR</strong> have taken a test onsite the day of move-in.</p>
<p>We understand and appreciate that you may be in the process of becoming compliant; however, you will continue to receive reminders until your Health E-Messenger record has been updated and marked compliant.</p>
<h1>Pre-Arrival COVID-19 Testing for Students Living in University Housing</h1>
<p><strong>As a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630767895093000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeH434LpxaEMFQ46p0QxiKfdDIEg" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-arrival requirement</a> ALL students moving into University Housing need to provide a hard copy or mobile-friendly proof of a test taken within 72 hours of checking in.</strong> A PCR or Antigen test is considered acceptable to meet the 72-hour testing requirement to come to campus. Over-the-counter Binex tests purchased at a pharmacy can also be used, as long as they use an application that can provide the Student Health Center with a test result.</p>
<h1>COVID-19 Testing Requirement for Off-Campus Students</h1>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz requires that ALL students &#8212; undergraduate or graduate, vaccinated or unvaccinated &#8212; test within five to seven days of arrival on campus and by Sept. 30.</strong> Anyone who tests positive should not come to campus and should contact the Student Health Center.</p>
<h1>COVID-19 Case in the Past Three Months</h1>
<p>If you were COVID positive in the past three months, you will not be required to provide a negative test result upon your arrival to campus. You must upload your positive result to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630767895093000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDOaNnlNt6G3unHRJtNjdal5doCw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health E-Messenger</a>. As long as 10 days have passed since you were last symptomatic, you will be permitted to check-in as long as you are compliant with the vaccine policy. Please notify the Student Health Center so they can write a letter for you. Otherwise, if you are a residential student, you will need to bring proof of your positive test results and confirmation that you completed your isolation period as stated above.</p>
<h1>Consequences for Non-Compliance with the UC Vaccine Policy</h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you do not upload proof of vaccination or show proof of filing a request for exception by Sept. 9, you will not be in compliance with the policy. <strong>You may also be referred to student conduct for non-compliance with university policy.</strong></p>
<p>Those not compliant with the policy are not permitted into any campus building and are denied admittance to any campus event. This means not being able to move in or attend classes unless you have confirmation that you have filed an exception or are in the process of becoming compliant. <strong>If you don't have an approved exception or have not uploaded proof of completed vaccination, on Nov. 1, 2021, you will receive a registration hold for winter quarter classes.</strong></p>

We gained valuable experience as we arranged for students to be bused to staging areas, lined up multiple-day accommodations for those who needed them, and quickly set up an off-site kitchen so we could provide meals for hundreds in our campus community who otherwise would have gone hungry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, the fire did not reach us, and we were able to begin repopulating campus within a week of leaving. The potential for a wildfire on our campus remains, however. Our region continues to experience severe drought conditions, and much of the vegetation on our campus and in parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains remains dangerously dry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to confront this uncertainty is through preparation, and we need your help with that. The Office of Emergency Services is partnering with our campus Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies unit to learn more about the evacuation needs of those in our community &#8212; students, staff and faculty &#8212; so campus emergency-response leaders can be fully prepared should we need to evacuate campus again.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evacuation-information form has been developed to help us with this information gathering. Faculty, staff, and students are scheduled to receive an email with a link to the form on Tuesday, Sept. 14.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions on the form range from where you generally work or study (Main Residential Campus, Coastal Science Campus, Silicon Valley Campus, etc.), how you would leave during an evacuation, and whether you might need transportation assistance if an emergency evacuation were ordered. All information gathered will inform our emergency planning &#8212; how many buses or hotel rooms would be needed, for example.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you in advance for your cooperation. The more participation we have, the better prepared we will be. Questions about the form can be directed to </span><a href="mailto:oes@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oes@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ace6f5ad807270466cc00b003ea0d89b"><name>wildlife-precautions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Take extra precautions with mountain lions, coyotes spotted on campus</title><summary>As in-person activity at the residential campus continues to ramp up, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department encourages people to be extra aware of their surroundings after receiving reports of a mountain lion and multiple coyotes exploring the campus core. </summary><start-date>1630652400000</start-date><display-name>Take extra precautions with mountain lions, coyotes spotted on campus</display-name><path>/2021/09/wildlife-precautions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/wildlife-precautions</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1630693422489</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1630693611005</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>As in-person activity at the residential campus continues to ramp up, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department encourages people to be extra aware of their surroundings after receiving reports of a mountain lion and multiple coyotes exploring the campus core.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mountain lions and coyotes are native to the Santa Cruz mountains. They generally avoid people unless they are protecting something like food or offspring or they are hunting.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Police Department would like to share the following tips in the event anyone encounters a mountain lion on campus or on the upper campus trails.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Keep children close to you. </strong><span>Observations of captured lions reveal that the animals seem especially drawn to children. Keep children within your sight at all times.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Do not hike alone</strong><span>. Make plenty of noise to reduce your chances of surprising a lion. Go in groups, with adults supervising children. A sturdy walking stick is a good idea: you can use it to ward off a lion.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>If you see a mountain lion/coyote, stop.</strong><span> Do not run. Back away from it slowly, but only if you can do so safely. Running may stimulate the instinct to chase and attack. Face the lion/coyote and stand upright. Make eye contact. If you have small children with you, pick them up so they won't panic and run. Although it may seem awkward, pick them up without bending over or turning away from the lion.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Do not bend or crouch over, and do all you can to appear larger. </strong><span>A person squatting or bending over looks a lot like a four-legged prey animal. Raise your arms. Open your jacket, if you're wearing one. Throw stones, branches, or whatever you can grab without crouching down or turning your back. Wave your arms slowly and speak firmly in a large voice.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Do not approach a lion,</strong><span><strong> especially one that is feeding or with kittens.</strong> Most mountain lions will try to avoid confrontation. Give them a way to escape.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span><strong>Fight back, if attacked.</strong> </span><span>Try to stay on your feet if a lion attacks you. Lions have been driven off by prey that fights back. Some hikers have fought back successfully with sticks, caps, jackets, garden tools, and their bare hands. Since lions usually try to bite the head or neck, try to remain standing and face the attacking animal.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Never feed or attempt to tame coyotes.</strong><span> The result may be deadly conflicts with pets or livestock, or serious injuries to small children.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Do not leave small children or pets outside unattended.</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span><strong>Be aware that coyotes are more active in the spring</strong>,</span><span> when feeding and protecting their young.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>If followed by a coyote, make loud noises.</strong><span> If this fails, throw rocks in the animal&#8217;s direction.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>If a coyote attacks a person</strong><span>, immediately contact the nearest law enforcement office.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.1 million project began in fall 2019 and was scheduled to take three months but was delayed by high surf. It required divers who could only work during minus tides at the base of a 30-foot coastal cliff. Work began again in summer of 2020 but was delayed again by the Aug. 16, 2020 lightning storm and subsequent CZU Lightning Complex Fire. The project was finally completed last September.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seawater intake system can deliver up to 1,000 gallons a minute to labs to UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Campus and nearby labs operated by state and federal agencies. The intake structure is located in a small pocket beach and had been damaged by corrosion and heavy wave action.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine separate federal, state and local regulatory agencies were involved in the permitting process.

The prospect of creating a robust system of online learning for 900 instructors and more than 18,000 students was daunting. <br/><br/>The campus had already begun a course redesign project for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) gateway courses, said Jody Greene, UCSC&#8217;s first associate vice provost for teaching and learning, and the founding CITL director. In a letter supporting the award nomination, Greene said that with the campus closed, &#8220;we took the skeleton of that course redesign protocol and the extensive knowledge of online instructional design practices from Online Education and, in one month, created &#8230; ICD-RI.&#8221; <br/><br/>The effort was a collaboration between two small offices&#8212;Online Education and CITL. At the time, Online Education had just four staff; CITL had two full-time and three part-time staff members. <br/><br/>In nominating Tassio, Zachmeier, and Bhattacharya for the award, Herbie Lee, UCSC&#8217;s vice provost for academic affairs, called ICD-RI &#8220;a remarkable achievement by this small group in supporting this many faculty at a large university. By creating a self-paced online tutorial, they created a scalable experience for many more of our faculty than they could have reached through workshops and consultations.<br/><br/>&#8220;The tutorial provides faculty and graduate student instructors concepts and tools for designing an effective online course, and was a critical part of our campus response to the emergency switch to online instruction as our state ceased in-person instruction, '' Lee said. <br/><br/>The <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/">Online Learning Consortium</a> is a non-profit professional organization of faculty, administration, instructional designers and other learning professionals, as well as educational institutions, professional societies, and corporate enterprises devoted to advancing quality online education. In a statement announcing the awards, OLC&#8217;s CEO Jennifer Mathes said the awards program &#8220;is an opportunity to showcase leadership and innovation in the field of online, blended, and digital learning. As a result of this self-paced faculty development initiative, online courses at UC Santa Cruz improved in not only accessibility but also other access issues highlighted and made visible by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#8221;<br/><br/>The organization is planning a free panel discussion and celebration at the OLC Accelerate Virtual Awards Gala, Sept. 20, at 7:45 p.m. (EDT). More information is available at: <a href="https://bit.ly/2021OLCAccelerateAwardsGala">https://bit.ly/2021OLCAccelerateAwardsGala</a>. In addition, winners have been invited to hold free public seminars on their work later this year.<br/><br/>Greene said she was surprised at how quickly the online course tutorial developed and how well it was accepted. &#8220;If you had told me a year ago that a third of instructors on campus would voluntarily enroll in a deep dive into course redesign in the following few months, I would not have believed you,&#8221; she wrote. <br/><br/>At the same time, it was a challenge. &#8220;Instructors had to learn &#8216;new tricks&#8217; specific to the online format, in which few had ever previously taught: they had to think deeply and differently about student engagement, effective communication, and maximizing accessibility, particularly for students in other time zones,&#8221; Greene wrote. <br/><br/>&#8220;Flexibility is a key tenet of the course,&#8221; Greene said, &#8220;understanding that many of our students are having enormous challenges getting access to the internet or balancing demands at home with the need to keep learning. Education this year has been consistently disrupted, and designing with disruption as a norm is essential to support equity and access in a pandemic.&#8221;<br/><br/>Though there were some detractors, students and faculty generally praised the experience. &#8220;My students and I both were able to learn challenging new things, while being supported, and feel a part of a community of learners, thanks to the thoughtful design of the ICD-RI course,&#8221; wrote Suzanne Alonzo, professor of ecology and&#160; evolutionary biology. <br/><br/>&#8220;All in all, the leadership of Bhattacharya, Tassio, and Zachmeier have made a tremendous difference for the students at UC Santa Cruz, increasing their equitable access to high quality courses and opportunities to learn during this period of remote instruction,&#8221; commented Samara Foster, CITL managing director. <br/><br/></p>

The </span><a href="https://ucsc.scalefunder.com/cfund/project/27323"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afghanistan Visiting Scholars Emergency Support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign, founded in response to the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, will finance the placement of at least three at-risk Afghans into visiting scholar appointments at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to ongoing safety concerns, the university is not disclosing the identities of the people who may become visiting scholars, but they are predominantly academics, journalists, and activists. UCSC is actively coordinating on several potential visiting scholar placements that will depend upon whether intended recipients can safely leave Afghanistan. At the start of the fundraising campaign, only two intended recipients were confirmed to have left the country, but organizers have since received confirmation for a third person.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding from the campaign is primarily intended to help hosting units on campus provide for the J-1 Scholar funding and health insurance visa requirements, set by the U.S. Department of State. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Afghanistan Visiting Scholars Emergency Support Fund collected more than $138,000 in public donations to support these efforts before the fundraising campaign&#8217;s Sept. 3 deadline. As a result, the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor&#8217;s Office provided $100,000 in matching funds, and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees contributed an additional $10,000 matching gift, bringing the total amount to more than $248,000 raised in just one week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is inspiring to see our community come together to help address these needs,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;We&#8217;re deeply grateful to all of the donors and to our faculty and staff colleagues and students who are working together to put our plans into action.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Campus Provost Adrian Brasoveanu is leading logistical efforts for the campus. He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said next steps will include helping visiting scholars start the visa application process by finding the right embassies and getting hard copies of important documents. While there&#8217;s still a lot of work ahead, the fundraising campaign has helped to address a major obstacle.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese donations enable us to go a long way in meeting visa funding requirements, and all of our other work for these scholars would not help if those funding requirements are not met,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So this has been essential.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon approval of visas, at least one visiting scholar would be placed with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for South Asian Studies. Another would be sponsored through the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair in Feminist Studies, in partnership with the Human Rights Investigations Lab at the Research Center for the Americas. And at least one more would be sponsored through the Politics Department.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university is assessing whether any additional funding will be needed to support dependents of visiting scholars. While the crowdfunding campaign for these efforts has concluded, the public can still make additional donations at a </span><a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=1095"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s online giving platform.&#160;</span></p>

Employees who have not taken these steps will be considered non-compliant on Sept. 10.</p>
<p>As of today, we have reached an employee <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631221364803000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-Ky-SW1ldzxvMk-enagNDGYz-dQ" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compliance level</a> of about 71%. Our compliance percentage reflects all those who are fully vaccinated plus those who have an approved exception or an exception request pending. While our compliance percentage has risen steadily during the past few weeks, we are still short of our goal of full compliance.</p>
<p>We want all in our campus community to fully understand the consequences of non-compliance. Employees who remain non-compliant will receive three notices, the first on Sept. 10. These notices will reiterate the information non-compliant employees need to comply. Non-compliant employees will not be immediately barred from campus. However, as a condition of being allowed on campus while they become compliant, they must immediately take steps to become compliant and comply with all non-pharmaceutical interventions including participating in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing at least every four days, wearing masks in all indoor public spaces, and completing the daily symptom checker.</p>
<p>In October, we will transition from the notice phase to progressive discipline, up to and including termination of employment. We expect terminations to be few in number. However, as a campus and as part of the University of California system, we have taken a firm position that vaccinations (with limited exceptions) are the best way to advance the health and well-being of our community and support our educational and research mission.</p>
<p>Compliance and any potential disciplinary actions will be the responsibility of supervisors and managers. Our legal, Staff Human Resources and Academic Personnel offices will collaboratively support and guide supervisors and managers (including Deans and department chairs, as applicable) through any appropriate disciplinary process.</p>
<p>All questions relating to vaccine compliance should be sent to <a href="mailto:shrhelp@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SHRhelp@ucsc.edu</a> .</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the afternoon, Santa Cruz Cinema will host a free movie for students&#8212;Jordan Peele&#8217;s hit horror movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Several important scenes of that movie were shot on location in Santa Cruz, with some highly recognizable landmarks including the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like downtowns and Main Streets across the United States, the business district of Santa Cruz went suddenly quiet when the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders hit in March 2020. But downtown has reawakened since then, with a bustling street scene that UC Santa Cruz students will soon rejoin.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz, the Santa Cruz Downtown Association, and the City of Santa Cruz Economic Development have teamed up to present this event.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since UC Santa Cruz swung open its doors more than a half-century ago, our students have contributed to the art, culture, and commerce of downtown Santa Cruz,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;In addition, many downtown businesses are owned by UCSC alumni, and stores like Bookshop Santa Cruz have contributed to the intellectual life of the campus for decades.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scavenger hunt will highlight several popular downtown businesses including The Penny Ice Creamery, Cruzio, 11th Hour Coffee, and Abbott Square, with prizes including student discounts, free movie tickets, City of Santa Cruz swag, and UCSC memorabilia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses throughout downtown will display "We Love Slugs" window clings and "Slug Discounts" at participating businesses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Student Union Assembly President Shivika Sivakumar is looking forward to returning both to campus and to Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I always have so much fun downtown, and it's really easy to get there since METRO buses go straight there from campus," said Sivakumar. "I love visiting the Museum of Art and History,&#160; studying in the caf&#233;s, grocery shopping, and hanging out with friends downtown on the weekends. I'm looking forward to getting back in the fall, and I'm so excited to be able to introduce fellow Slugs to downtown with Downtown Day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Day participants can start their festivities at the downtown information kiosk at 1130 Pacific Avenue K2, at the corner of Pacific and Soquel avenues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/downtownday"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Day</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will run 1&#8211;4 p.m. Friday, Sept. 24, on Pacific Avenue in downtown Santa Cruz. At the end of the afternoon, Santa Cruz Cinema will host a free movie for students (the Jordan Peele horror film</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Us</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), starting at 4:15 p.m.&#160;</span></i></p>

She teamed up with Assistant Professor of Education Samuel Severance to develop the idea, and their proposal was awarded a $40,000 grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p>
<p>Their &#8220;Seed Spoon Science&#8221; pilot program aims to improve outcomes for Latinx STEM majors at UC Santa Cruz and engage local school children and their families in science through gardening. The program will recruit ten Spanish-speaking undergraduates in STEM majors and pair them with ten local Spanish-speaking families with children in elementary school. The UCSC students and participating families will then develop a set of science projects for the children to carry out in the family&#8217;s home garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;The undergrads will serve as mentors and the kids will be practicing science in the home environment,&#8221; Leauthaud explained. &#8220;At the end of the year we&#8217;ll have a Harvest Festival where the kids will present their projects, we&#8217;ll have food from the gardens, and we&#8217;ll talk about what worked and what didn&#8217;t and how they solved the problems they encountered.&#8221;</p>
<p>One goal of the program is to build community and improve graduation rates for Latinx STEM majors. Serving as mentors for local children will help build their identity as scientists and increase their sense of belonging in STEM, Leauthaud said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the program will help build the next generation of STEM college students by nourishing an interest in science in the participating children and their parents and families. Early identification with science and scientists can have a large impact on decisions about whether or not to go to college, and what to study at college.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parents play a big role in setting career paths, and we hope this experience will help them see their kids as scientists and will help establish connections with UCSC,&#8221; Leauthaud said.</p>
<p>Severance emphasized the importance of working with the families as partners in the program. &#8220;We want to respect the expertise folks already have and the goals they have for what they want to do with their gardens and what problems they want to solve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re there to support and work with the families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gardening is often used as an accessible, unintimidating way to teach science. Leauthaud and Severance will partner with Santa Cruz-based Life Lab, which provides garden-based learning programs in schools across the country, to organize training workshops for the participants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to bring the Life Lab experience into the home setting to have more engagement with the parents and families,&#8221; Leauthaud explained. &#8220;It encourages the idea that everyone can be a scientist and that scientific principles are useful for everyday things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leauthaud, who has a large home garden, said she often uses her science skills in the garden. &#8220;I&#8217;m always taking notes, doing experiments, and just using the basic principles of science to guide my decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The undergraduates will also produce a bilingual newsletter to go out every two months to participants in the program, covering themes related to science, gardening, and food, and including stories about experiments, problems encountered, and how they were solved. The newsletter will help students build STEM identity and improve writing skills, while helping to create a sense of community and highlighting the intersection of science and cultural practices.</p>
<p>The program will include extensive assessments, including interviews with all participants conducted by the Educational Partnership Center. The program will also conduct follow-up assessments of student success for the participating STEM majors.</p>
<p>Severance said he looks forward to studying the results of the program. &#8220;In trying to engage kids in science, it&#8217;s always a challenge to find something tangible that&#8217;s meaningful to them, and this project has a lot of good pieces we can study to learn how to make these kinds of experiences accessible and doable outside of school,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot we can learn from this about how students develop a sense of identity as science learners, what the barriers are and how to navigate those, and what resources we might leverage to try to ensure these opportunities will be available for people in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Key partners in the program include Teresa McCaffrey at the Educational Partnership Center; Linnea Beckett at the Apprenticeship in Community-Engaged Research Program; STEM Diversity Programs Director Yulianna Ortega; Elif Demir Hilton in the Office of Research; Judit Camacho, co-executive director of Life Lab; Cal Teach Director Gretchen Andreasen; and Professor of Literature Juan Poblete.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e012a17b807270466cc00b00d6e22900"><name>guidance-instructors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Instructors with Household Members at High Risk for COVID</title><summary>To align with other UC campuses and based on feedback from our own instructor community, I write today to inform you that we have established an additional process where instructors (including GSIs and TAs with instructional responsibilities) may request a modification to their work duties and responsibilities due to a member of their household being moderately to severely immunocompromised.</summary><start-date>1631257200000</start-date><display-name>Guidance</display-name><path>/2021/09/guidance-instructors</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/guidance-instructors</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1631551922527</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581041334</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Campus Colleagues,</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/instructional-guidance.html">August 27 guidance</a> I noted that instructors teaching in-person classes in fall quarter &#8216;21 would not be permitted to change their classes to remote, except under narrow circumstances as a result of the disability accommodation process. As has been previously communicated, if an instructor has a disability that restricts them from teaching in person for fall 2021, they should immediately contact Disability Manager Kelly Roberts (<a href="mailto:roberts@ucsc.edu">roberts@ucsc.edu</a>) and Director of Academic Employee Relations Danny Gray (<a href="mailto:dggray@ucsc.edu">dggray@ucsc.edu</a>) in order to initiate the disability accommodation process.</p>
<p>To align with other UC campuses and based on feedback from our own instructor community, I write today to inform you that we have established an additional process where instructors (including GSIs and TAs with instructional responsibilities) may request a modification to their work duties and responsibilities due to a member of their household being moderately to severely immunocompromised. In cases where an instructor has a member of their immediate household who is immunocompromised, such that under the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html">current CDC guidelines</a> they would be eligible for an additional COVID&#8211;19 vaccine dose (a &#8220;booster&#8221;), that instructor may be considered for permission to shift to remote instruction for fall 2021.</p>
<p>In order to receive this consideration, the instructor (or TA/GSI) must submit their request, along with <a href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/covid-19/ucsc_immunocompromised_household_member_form.pdf">this form</a>, filled out by themselves and their household member&#8217;s health care provider, to <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu">apo@ucsc.edu</a> as soon as possible. Additionally, the instructor&#8217;s department chair (or provost/program director, if applicable) must submit a letter directly to <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu">apo@ucsc.edu</a> stating the learning objectives of the course being requested to be shifted to remote, and the chair&#8217;s opinion on whether the learning objectives can reasonably be met through a remote modality. It is the instructor&#8217;s responsibility to request this letter from their department chair.</p>
<p>Consideration for this category of modification to work duties and responsibilities is currently available only for fall quarter 2021.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions to Danny Gray (<a href="mailto:dggray@ucsc.edu">dggray@ucsc.edu</a>).</p>

awarded the <i>2021 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters </i>from <strong><i>The National Book Foundation</i></strong>, presenter of the National Book Awards.</span></p>
<p><span>Yamashita is now the 34th recipient of the prestigious lifetime achievement award, joining the ranks of such prominent authors as Toni Morrison, Walter Mosley, Isabel Allende, Don DeLillo, Joan Didion, E.L. Doctorow, Maxine Hong Kingston, Stephen King, Ursula K. Le Guin, Elmore Leonard, Norman Mailer, and Adrienne Rich.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;A bold and groundbreaking writer, Yamashita&#8217;s deeply creative body of work has made an enduring impact on our literary landscape,&#8221; noted David Steinberger, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Book Foundation. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s an evocative exploration of cities, collaborative performance productions, or connecting the plots of Jane Austen to Japanese American life, her work reaches across time, country, and culture to offer readers a powerfully complex guide to our world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The author of 10 books, Yamashita received a 2011 California Book Award in the Fiction category for her novel&#160;<i>I Hotel</i>, and was&#160;a finalist for the National Book Award.&#160;<i>I Hotel</i>&#160;also won the American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award, and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award.</span></p>
<p><span>Known for her intensely researched works that reflect her interest in communities whose stories often go untold, Yamashita received the <i>Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity</i> in 2009 and was co-holder with feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker of the UC Presidential Chair for Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Her books include&#160;<i>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</i>&#160;(1990), which received the American Book Award, and&#160;<i>Brazil-Maru</i>, named by the&#160;<i>Village Voice</i>&#160;as one of the 25 best books of 1992. <i>Tropic of Orange</i>&#160;(1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with&#160;<i>Circle K Cycles</i>&#160;(2001), a book based on her research on the Brazilian community in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/yamashita-internment-memoir.html"><em>Letters to Memory</em></a>&#160;</strong>(2017) examines her own family&#8217;s experience in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II through letters, stories, photographs, official documents, art, journals, and other personal records found in the family archive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>And her latest book, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/07/yamashita-japanese-america.html"><strong><i>Sansei and Sensibility</i></strong></a><i> (2020)</i>, is a collection of short stories about growing up and living in Japanese America.</span></p>
<p><span>All of Yamashita&#8217;s books have been published by Coffee House Press, a nonprofit independent press based in Minneapolis. Her archives are housed in McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Through adept crafting, passionate research, and timely narratives, Yamashita defines, and re-defines, again and again, what storytelling can do,&#8221; said Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. &#8220;In her books, she compels and challenges readers to engage with ideas, identities, and complicated worlds that mirror the complexity of life. We are honored to celebrate her extraordinary literary accomplishments and center her contributions to American culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017, Yamashita delivered a keynote address at the inaugural Asian American Literature Festival, hosted by the Asian Pacific American Center, the Smithsonian, and the Library of Congress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The following year, she received a VONA (Voices of Our Nations Arts Foundation Tribute), and in 2019, a John Dos Passos Prize for Literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>As a recipient of the National Book Foundation&#8217;s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, Yamashita will receive $10,000 plus a solid brass medal at an awards ceremony scheduled for November 17.</span></p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz chemistry associate professor Laura Sanchez reflects on what helped her succeed and how she has tried to help others do the same</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz chemistry associate professor Laura Sanchez has never been surrounded by a lot of other Hispanics as she has built her career in science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the low representation of her ethnic group has only become more apparent as she has risen in her field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The older you get, the more you realize you're the only one in the room that looks like you," said Sanchez, who is also an alumna (Ph.D. '12, chemistry and biochemistry).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hispanic Heritage Month approaches, she stopped to reflect on what helped her succeed and how she has tried to help others do the same. The month&#8212;which is September 15 through October 15&#8212;is meant to recognize the contributions and influence of Hispanic Americans to the history, culture, and achievements of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having good mentors, being willing to move, and having adequate financial support are among the factors that help the most, she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez joined UC Santa Cruz in January after moving her lab from the University of Illinois at Chicago in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, where she had been since 2015. She "specializes in using and adapting imaging mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry for small molecule analyses in complex systems," according to her lab website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a homecoming of sorts, as she completed her doctoral work at UC Santa Cruz and grew up in the Bay Area. She has enjoyed the chance to reconnect with family and friends, visit the family's house in Clearlake, and adopt a rescue dog.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recently represented the university at the "Breaking Barriers through Chemistry" virtual conference, which brought together chemistry professors to promote more collaboration between universities in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The child of a carpenter and a paralegal, Sanchez became interested in chemistry while attending high school in Antioch in the East Bay. She preferred it to more theoretical sciences like physics and later enjoyed taking chemistry classes in college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It was the only thing that made sense," she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since her parents didn't have a background in science, it was the mentors she met as an undergrad at Whitman College in Washington and later as a doctoral student who showed her the pathway to follow. Other Hispanic students face similar challenges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But finding a good mentor can be more difficult than people think, Sanchez said. A mentor should be someone who wants the best for a student, which is not necessarily always the student's supervisors. Sometimes students find out too late that the person they thought was their mentor doesn't have their back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Finding your support network/village can be difficult," Sanchez said. "You need to seek it earlier. Don't wait until there is a crisis."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge Hispanics in science face is balancing work and family responsibilities. Hispanics tend to have a strong connection to family. They may be unwilling to move to pursue career opportunities. Some careers aren't possible in some areas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial resources are also a barrier. It costs a lot of money to move from one part of the country to another. Sanchez offers to reimburse moving costs to her postdoctorate researchers, but she said that is not standardized.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itzel Lizama-Chamu, a junior research specialist in Sanchez's lab, said Sanchez is an excellent mentor and inspiring role model. Lizama-Chamu was so impressed with her that she followed her to Santa Cruz from University of Illinois at Chicago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lizama-Chamu met Sanchez in 2017 when she heard her give a talk about her research.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What caught my attention about Dr. Sanchez was the way in which she made difficult concepts easy to understand, and her enthusiasm for her and her students' work," said Lizama-Chamu.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Mexican-American, Lizama-Chama said her family has sometimes been skeptical of her choice to pursue a career in science. They have wondered if the expense and long years of study are worth it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Seeing that Laura was able to do that and she's happy and has a stable work-life balance, that's amazing," Lizama-Chamu said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez is glad to do what she can to help, just as others have helped her. She is heartened that more Hispanics are finding science positions in the academic world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Of the people who've made it," she said, "they're good about turning around and helping you get up the ladder too." </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1210ad0807270466cc00b005917aca9"><name>giving-day-2021-advance-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving Day 2021: Widening the circle of support</title><summary>Giving Day, UC Santa Cruz’s wildly successful and fast-paced 24-hour crowdfunding contest, returns on November 3, with a strong emphasis on programs designed to support students in these challenging times.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/">Giving Day</a>, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s wildly successful and fast-paced 24-hour crowdfunding contest, returns on November 3, with a strong emphasis on programs designed to support students in these challenging times.</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This impactful philanthropic event, now going into its sixth year, is mostly virtual by design. Part of the fun is refreshing the Giving Day page over and over again to see which projects are surging ahead in fundraising challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event has gone from a fledgling fundraiser to one of the philanthropic highlights of the year. Marissa Fullum-Campbell, director of annual support at UCSC, attributes Giving Day&#8217;s growing popularity in part to its impact and transparency.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is it such a success?&#8221; she said. "I think it&#8217;s that people can see exactly where their money is going. If people get an invitation to support an athletic team, for example, they know it is because the team is paying for jerseys, travel costs, and equipment. Knowing how the funds will be used empowers supporters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, parents, friends, and alumni across the country participate in supporting Giving Day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Giving Day project gets its own dedicated web page, with detailed information on projects and where the funding is needed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, at least 130 projects will seek funding. Though most of the action takes place online, there is usually some analog component, with booths set up in various gathering places across the campus to inspire excitement and generosity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic made the event pivot to an all-virtual format last year. This year, with students returning to campus for in-person learning, there will be a small but visible Giving Day presence on campus, with a few Giving Day booths set up at Quarry Plaza, weather permitting, and with an in-person greeting by Sammy the Slug. Helpers will circulate with iPads that donors can use to donate to various projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Giving Day&#8217;s popular traditions will continue this year. As in past years, supporters will start funding programs at the stroke of 12 a.m. on November 3 and keep on going until 11:59 p.m. Giving Day&#8217;s website will provide up-to-the-moment tallies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to see many exciting Giving Day projects in the lineup, with a combination of old mainstays and newcomers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/make-a-gift/scholarship.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Association Scholarship Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AASF) has had a strong presence in past Giving Day celebrations, but this year marks this eminent organization&#8217;s 30th anniversary&#8212;an additional incentive to support it. The funds from this project will go exclusively to students in financial need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is so wonderful about this [AASF] fund is that it supports a student in good academic standing for the entirety of their undergraduate career,&#8221; Fullum-Campbell said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Faculty Initiative will have a Giving Day project this year to raise money for an alumni speaker panel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fundraiser is part of AAPI Faculty Initiative&#8217;s goal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aise awareness about the experiences, perspectives, and contributions of Asian and Asian American students, staff, and faculty and increase cross-cultural understanding through events, education, exhibitions, and other programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SlugCents, which offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial literacy coaching to students, is holding a Giving Day fundraiser to help with its mission to provide all students with equal access to financial resources so they can understand the UCSC financial system, make informed decisions about planning for higher education, graduate with as little debt as possible, and learn lifelong skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SlugCents offers financial information, workshops, resources, and other programming to all UCSC students, including recent alumni and students taking a leave of absence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, supporters should keep a close watch on &#8220;challenge times,&#8221; during which the project that has the most unique donors in a specified time period is awarded bonus dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that relentless pace does not let up. This is not a marathon. It&#8217;s more like a series of 100-yard dashes, including an all-out push to the finish line at the very end.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last-minute burst at the end of the day has its reward: The group that has the most unique donors during the whole day is awarded bonus dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day started out as an unconventional fundraising event, known for its independent spirit and its willingness to break with custom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than fall back on traditional modes of giving, this event encourages &#8220;micro-donations&#8221;&#8212;small but important gifts that fund worthy programs while increasing the campus&#8217;s circle of loyal supporters, attracting and encouraging future giving.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz community showed its generosity by contributing </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/giving-day-2020-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than $600,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The goal is always to exceed the previous year&#8217;s fundraising figure,&#8217;&#8217; Fullum-Campell said. But she&#8217;s more excited about increasing overall donor engagement and excitement about giving. &#8220;If we receive a notable increase in the number of undergraduate alumni who are giving this year, that is a win in our book.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e14dc60c807270466cc00b004cb8dead"><name>fall-important-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Important information regarding fall quarter 2021</title><summary>We look forward to welcoming back our students, again offering in-person activities and sporting events, opening additional facilities for campus use, and feeling that energy that we’ve sorely missed and that makes our Slug community special.</summary><start-date>1631516400000</start-date><display-name>Important information regarding fall quarter 2021</display-name><path>/2021/09/fall-important-information</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/fall-important-information</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1631572575724</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581084717</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are thrilled to return to in-person instruction next week at UC Santa Cruz. We look forward to welcoming back our students, again offering in-person activities and sporting events, opening additional facilities for campus use, and feeling that energy that we&#8217;ve sorely missed and that makes our Slug community special.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve learned over the past 18 months, COVID-19 is hard to predict, and while we are eager for everyone to return, we must remain nimble and flexible in our transition to primarily in-person instruction this fall. We are reaching out today to provide an update on our COVID-19 protocols and give you an idea of what you can expect when you return to campus.</p>

<h2>Fall Instruction Update</h2>
<p>The majority of our classes &#8212; approximately 68 percent &#8212; will be in-person this fall. Individual students will see variations depending on their major and the courses they are planning to take. Classes with more than 150 students make up the bulk of our remote offerings. We expect to have even more in-person courses in winter and spring as we return to more regular operations providing that the vaccines continue to be effective against COVID-19 variants. Over the past six quarters, including two Summer Sessions, we have learned many lessons in instruction, innovation and access, and we aim to keep what we&#8217;ve learned front of mind as we move forward.</p>
<p>The McHenry Library and Science &amp; Engineering Library buildings are open. Library patrons are asked to check the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.ucsc.edu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMNVkMa19pEoOMZSlJ5JukVesiCQ" href="https://library.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University Library website</a>for the most current hours of operation, service updates and campus/building safety protocols. The library's study rooms will be available to reserve <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/reserve-a-study-room&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5KZ9_xnwEAQ_t63m5BLqk4PvjsQ" href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/reserve-a-study-room" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this fall</a> .<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/reserve-a-study-room&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5KZ9_xnwEAQ_t63m5BLqk4PvjsQ" href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/reserve-a-study-room" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<h2>Fall Move-In Parking and Traffic Reminders</h2>
<p>On Sept. 16-19, we will welcome more than 9,000 residential students to our campus community. As it&#8217;s been more than 18 months since we&#8217;ve had this much campus activity, we want to remind you of the campus parking and traffic impacts we typically experience and ask for your patience and flexibility.</p>
<p>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus during move-in. If you are an employee, please consider an alternative work site if operationally feasible, and your supervisor allows. Additionally, we strongly encourage using alternative commute options to get to and from campus (such as sharing a ride or utilizing public transportation such as <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scmtd.com/en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjIHuyr0Vu3qvw9GvqHV6oO10MbA" href="https://www.scmtd.com/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz METRO</a> bus service) to help accommodate move-in traffic.</p>
<h2>Welcome Week and Cornucopia</h2>
<p>Required Welcome Week sessions will be offered virtually, but optional Welcome Week events will be a mix of virtual and in-person. Students should have received access to the Welcome Week Canvas schedule. College-specific Welcome Week activities/sessions were also included in the Welcome Week Canvas schedule sent by the Orientation Office. Speaking of welcoming, we are welcoming back our popular <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recreation.ucsc.edu/cornucopia/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJQLUXVBYYjU8VB01dwkdoPRwXXA" href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/cornucopia/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cornucopia event,</a> which will be held on Sept. 20-21.</p>
<h2>Final Reminder: Mandatory Proof of Vaccination Required</h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t completed it already, please upload your proof of vaccination immediately into <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://studenthealth.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGb_wqht2EPncpPsp9uudeADgMC3w" href="http://studenthealth.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health E-Messenger</a> to be compliant with <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/student-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHc5-GtXYd5cj0VEC7SMt2A4F8eyw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/student-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Vaccine Policy</a> <em>. Please note:</em> If you received your vaccination on the UC Santa Cruz campus, we have your vaccine card on file, and no action is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Unvaccinated students who have filed a request for exception</strong> <strong>or already have an approved exception</strong> will be required to have a COVID-19 test upon arrival to campus and test on campus every four days following their arrival. Unvaccinated students will be required to sequester for seven days after arriving on campus, interacting minimally with other persons while strictly observing all COVID-19 spread mitigation precautions.</p>
<p><strong>Unvaccinated students who have not filed a request for exception or whose exception request has been denied</strong> are not allowed on campus. They will not be allowed to move into an on-campus residential assignment if they have one, attend in-person classes or attend any other business or activities on site with the exception of accessing health services at the Student Health Center.</p>
<p>For faculty and staff, <strong>you must take one of the following actions immediately</strong> :</p>

Please reach out to your Staff Human Resources and Academic Personnel offices with any questions.</p>
<h2>Consequences for Non-Compliance with the UC Vaccine Policy</h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t uploaded your proof of vaccination or filed a request for an exception, you are considered non-compliant with the policy.</p>
<p><strong>For students,</strong> this means not being able to move in or attend classes unless you have filed an exception or are in the process of becoming fully vaccinated (i.e., you have received the first shot as part of a COVID-19 vaccine series). If you are a student, you may also be referred to student conduct for non-compliance with university policy. <strong>If you don&#8217;t have an approved exception or have not uploaded proof of completed vaccination, on Nov. 1, 2021, you will receive a registration hold for winter quarter classes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For employees,</strong> you will <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/covid-policy-beginning.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHshlLSYQKPom2xWpwd-GrqQnnA4g" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/covid-policy-beginning.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continue to receive notices to comply</a> . Non-compliant employees will not be immediately barred from campus. However, as a condition of being allowed on campus while they become compliant, they must immediately take steps to become compliant and comply with all non-pharmaceutical interventions, including participating in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing at least every four days, wearing masks in all indoor public spaces, and completing the daily symptom checker. If you do not comply by October, you may face progressive discipline, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>We take this policy very seriously&#8212;having a fully compliant, if not fully vaccinated, campus is vital to the health and well-being of our campus community.</p>
<h2>Testing Resources</h2>
<p><strong>Asymptomatic Testing</strong></p>
<p>The campus will continue its asymptomatic testing program, focusing on unvaccinated faculty, staff, and students. Vaccinated faculty, staff, and students may also utilize the campus asymptomatic testing services. Asymptomatic COVID-19 testing on campus is available at the Merrill Cultural Center. Additional information about testing hours, scheduling appointments and locations will be posted soon. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdrVvoVoouQO4oHD9eGJ8C_V97Mg" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Information is available online</a> about the specifics of the Asymptomatic Testing program for vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>
<p><strong>Symptomatic Testing</strong></p>
<p>Vaccinated and unvaccinated students experiencing possible COVID related symptoms should access testing at the Student Health Center. Employees experiencing possible COVID-19 related symptoms should see their primary care doctor and/or undergo COVID-19 testing off campus. You will also be prompted to complete the symptom screening survey every day.</p>
<h2>Badge System for Students</h2>
<p>The campus will again be instituting its badge system for students in <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631658625315000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdF9jaUpsh7rkDmCwE_qwWN5-Bzw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health e-Messenger.</a> The badge shows your compliance status. You may need to show this badge when you participate in UCSC activities like eating at dining halls, attending in-person classes, etc. To see your badge status, which will be activated one week before classes start, go to your Health e-Messenger home screen and select Show Badge. The badge will display the following colors, depending on your level of compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GREEN (CLEARED):</strong> You can come to campus and be on-site. You must still follow all UCSC COVID-related protocols.</li>
<li><strong>YELLOW (OVERDUE):</strong> You may come to campus/on-site, but you are late for your required COVID-19 test and/or you have not completed your daily symptom screening survey and must take immediate action. Please note that access to campus services, such as dining, campus business services, advising, classes and labs, recreational facilities, libraries and transit, etc., may be impacted.</li>
<li><strong>RED (NOT CLEARED, IN QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION):</strong> You <strong>cannot</strong> be on campus/on site except to access healthcare services at the Student Health Center. This means you are:
<ul>
<li><em>Not in compliance with UC COVID-19 Vaccination Policy:</em>Log on to Health e-Messenger and submit proof of vaccination or exemption request.</li>
<li><em>Quarantine:</em> Until your healthcare provider says it's OK to leave, you are advised to stay at home but may go out for a walk with face covering, avoiding other people. Quarantine is used for people who were exposed to COVID-19. Usually quarantine lasts 10-14 days from the day of exposure.</li>
<li><em>Isolation:</em> Stay home until your healthcare provider says it's OK to leave. Isolation is used to separate sick people from others. Isolation usually lasts 10-14 days from the first day of symptoms, providing all symptoms are improving and you have no fever for 24 hours (without using a fever-reducing medication like Tylenol).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BLUE (NOT APPLICABLE):</strong> Your badge is not used for access to any site. This likely means the UC COVID-19 Vaccination Policy is not applicable because you are not coming to campus or any university site for any reason. If you see Blue and believe it to be an error, please contact Student Health Services to resolve the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Face Covering Requirements</h2>
<p>Face coverings are required in all in-door spaces with minor exceptions and for all passengers riding Campus Transit shuttles and METRO buses. Additionally, masks may be required for outdoor activities when large crowds are expected.</p>
<p>In closing, we are thankful for all of our campus community&#8217;s work to help in the return to full operations. We look forward to seeing our Slugs in person soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cindy and Lori</p>

<p>The new programs&#8212;&#8220;Preparing for Faculty Careers in the Biomedical Field,&#8221; based in UCSC&#8217;s Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells (IBSC), and the &#8220;LALS Future Faculty Program,&#8221; based in the Department of Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS)&#8212;are intended to enhance faculty diversity and promote equity and inclusion in higher education.</p>
<p>The IBSC program will complement two other recently funded IBSC programs that focus on supporting underrepresented minorities at the undergraduate and postdoctoral levels. The addition of a program focused on graduate students enables a complete and cohesive career development pipeline for minority students in the biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It fills a gap. We&#8217;re very excited to have these three complementary programs at different levels of the pipeline,&#8221; said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering and co-director of the IBSC.</p>
<p>Forsberg and IBSC co-director Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology, oversee the programs together with IBSC Program Director Catharina Casper-Lindley. Yuliana Ortega, director of UCSC&#8217;s STEM Diversity Programs, and Zia Isola, director of the Genomics Institute Office of Diversity Programs, will advise them on program details.</p>
<p>The new program has several components designed to promote recruitment to and retention in UCSC doctoral programs in biomedical sciences. Recruitment efforts will focus on four California State Universities in central California (San Jos&#233;, Monterey Bay, East Bay, and San Francisco), all Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Current UCSC graduate students will talk to students in biology classes about their experiences and paths to graduate school, and CSU students will also be invited to visit UCSC to learn about the campus and its graduate programs.</p>
<p>Forsberg emphasized that graduate students who participate in outreach and other aspects of the program will receive funding and support so that it is not an additional burden. &#8220;A lot of our students are active in trying to create a better environment and increasing diversity, and we want to capture their passion and reward them for their efforts, because it&#8217;s valuable for everyone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The program aims to strengthen support systems for underrepresented minority graduate students, providing funding to attend national meetings and also reaching out to their families. According to Hinck, family support can be crucial for first-generation students pursuing a Ph.D. and working toward a faculty position in academia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to tell their families this isn&#8217;t an impossible goal and explain the benefits of persevering,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The IBSC will pilot a new &#8220;Family science weekend&#8221; and evaluate its effectiveness and impact on underrepresented Ph.D. students at UCSC. Other program components include increasing access to academic leadership training and activities to build career skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Latin American and Latino Studies Department, a new Future Faculty Program will offer doctoral students the chance to participate in an eight-week summer publishing institute and a full-day job market preparation workshop. Professor Jessica Taft envisioned the concept for the program, and Associate Professor Patricia Pinho will now lead its development.</p>
<p>The job market workshop will focus on teaching students how to leverage and articulate their qualifications for a wide range of different academic positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seek to prepare underrepresented students for the professoriate, but it is also meant to work the other way around, as we hope to better educate the job market about the value of an LALS degree,&#8221; Pinho said. &#8220;Our doctoral program is unique in that it offers an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to the study of the peoples, cultures, societies, and institutions of the Americas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The LALS program&#8217;s interdisciplinary approach often yields important research insights by applying methods that challenge Eurocentric notions of knowledge production. But academic journals are often still structured tightly around the bounds of traditional disciplines. This and other barriers to entry across the broader publishing industry can uphold harmful hierarchies of power that limit whose voices are heard.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge production of some racial and ethnic groups has been historically marginalized or excluded,&#8221; Pinho explained. &#8220;Through the promotion of <em>otros saberes&#8212;</em>roughly, &#8216;other ways of knowing&#8217;&#8212;and supporting a greater number of underrepresented minorities to gain access to publishing, these barriers and the hegemony of Western paradigms can be challenged.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help address this issue, the publishing institute portion of the Future Faculty Program will teach students how to successfully navigate the review and publication process at academic journals. Participants will also have a chance to improve their writing skills. Pinho says she hopes this will ultimately enable students to reach a broader audience with their insights.</p>
<p>During both the publishing institute and the job market preparation workshop, the Future Faculty program will bring in faculty members from partner HSIs across California to foster a culture of collaboration among and between faculty and students. This will provide professional networking opportunities and other benefits that run much deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;While collaboration is important in any setting, it is even more important for groups that have been historically underrepresented, because it builds community and provides positive role models,&#8221; Pinho said. &#8220;And this, in turn, contributes to boosting self-confidence and demystifying academia.&#8221;</p>

Marco Rolandi, who had been appointed as director earlier this year, withdrew due to extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>CIED promotes the development, research, and teaching of innovation and entrepreneurship at UC Santa Cruz and its partners. The center works with faculty, students, and the Santa Cruz community to support technological innovation and entrepreneurship through a variety of programs and activities.</p>
<p>Camps said he looks forward to building a dynamic and sustainable entrepreneurship community on campus, working closely with the assistant vice chancellor for innovation and business engagement to integrate entrepreneurship programs across the campus through the new <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu">Innovation and Business Engagement Hub</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to integrate the different programs and organizations that support I&amp;E on campus into one platform with well-defined points of entry. The pieces are already there,&#8221; Camps said. &#8220;CIED is already operating very interesting programs like Idea Hub that have established partnerships with different stakeholders on campus and in the community, so we already have a head-start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said Camps is well positioned to lead CIED, given his expertise as a researcher and his leadership as a college provost in helping to create student-focused innovation and entrepreneurship programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manel has developed a compelling vision for advancing the center&#8217;s work and connecting it to more programs and organizations across campus,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;I am excited to see this work unfold in the year ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a researcher, Camps runs a lab focused on the role of genetic variation in protein and genomic evolution, including technology development that has generated intellectual property. In his new role as CIED director, Camps also plans to build on his experiences over the past six years at Crown College, where he oversaw the development of a new educational program in I&amp;E with the support of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and generous gifts from Crown alumni. This program includes two survey courses introducing students to the basics of business plan design and market discovery, as well as a service-learning class.</p>
<p>In developing the program, Camps worked closely with lecturers Nada Miljkovic and Peter Koht, both UCSC alumni and successful entrepreneurs who are well connected with the local business community. A pipeline to a variety of internships was established through a partnership with <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/getvirtual.html">GetVirtual</a>, an organization co-founded by Nada Miljkovic and entrepreneur Toby Corey that helps small businesses build their online presence and weather the pandemic. Complementing Crown&#8217;s efforts in the area of entrepreneurship, Camps is also overseeing the development of a Center for Applied Values and Ethics in Advanced Technologies (CAVEAT), led by ethicist Linda Glenn.</p>
<p>Camps noted that, thanks to a <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-students-gain-new-resources-opportunities-through-expanded-entrepreneurship-program">partnership</a> between the UC Office of the President and Blackstone, CIED has two entrepreneurs in residence, Mothusi Pahl and Andrea Carafa, who are invaluable to CIED&#8217;s mission. &#8220;They have been instrumental in driving much of the center&#8217;s impact-driven work, through the <a href="https://startups.ucsc.edu/ucsc-nsf-i-corps-site/">National Science Foundation Innovation Corps</a> and the <a href="https://ideahub.sites.ucsc.edu/">Idea Hub</a>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our entrepreneurs in residence have also served as veritable linchpins connecting our student entrepreneurs with supporting networks of funding and expertise through initiatives such as <a href="https://www.cruzx.org/landing?space_id=1914088">CruzX</a>, the <a href="https://ideahub.sites.ucsc.edu/">Idea Hub</a>, the <a href="https://www.blackstonelaunchpad.org/">Blackstone</a><u> Launchpad</u>, and the<a href="https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/civic-innovation-forum"> Civic Innovation Forum</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camps said he is committed to getting more students involved and encourages people to think more broadly about entrepreneurship. &#8220;I see entrepreneurship as a way to make an impact on society&#8212;it&#8217;s not just about technology and founding startup companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Students from all majors, identities, and backgrounds have a role to play in entrepreneurship, following their own passions, interests, and pathways. I want to build a program that is cross-disciplinary and accessible to all our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camps noted that supporting I&amp;E education has an important diversity and inclusion dimension, as historically excluded students are at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing the social capital and support networks that are critical to succeed as entrepreneurs. &#8220;A well-scaffolded mentorship structure anchored in robust training programs will help open I&amp;E to all students,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Camps also said he was encouraged by the support for CIED from the campus administration. &#8220;The administration sees how strategically important this is and is demonstrating its support for inclusive I&amp;E,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A thriving I&amp;E community on campus creates more opportunities for engagement with partners looking for ideas, solutions, and employees and organically improves the career development opportunities available for UCSC students both before and after graduation, he added. &#8220;Whether founding their own company, consulting, or working for a high-growth company, students are acquiring the tools and experience needed to create their own employment and pathways for career development,&#8221; Camps said. &#8220;CIED can be a catalyst for incorporating these ideas into a cross-disciplinary educational program to prepare students for these opportunities.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e54ba0db807270466cc00b00e6aae664"><name>hsi-programs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pairing research excellence and status as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz launching new programs to advance educational equity</title><summary>Committed to creating educational equity that will help lead to real, transformative change, UC Santa Cruz will launch an array of new programs to support the success of Latinx, low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students and prepare them for rewarding careers once they graduate.</summary><start-date>1631602800000</start-date><display-name>HSI Initiatives</display-name><path>/2021/09/hsi-programs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/hsi-programs</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1631639543986</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632164045260</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>hispanic-heritage</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/hsi-active-learning-600px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/hsi-active-learning-600px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hsi-active-learning-600px.jpg</name><display-name>hsi-active-learning-600px.jpg</display-name><file-size>227778</file-size><width>600</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>Students engage in active learning</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/learning-support-services-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/learning-support-services-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>learning-support-services-80px.jpg</name><display-name>learning-support-services-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>19438</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students studying</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz students engage in small group active learning teaching sessions during a lecture.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>One of only four members of the Association of American Universities that is also a Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz provides students with a high-quality education that offers opportunities to participate in research and creative scholarship </article-subhead><article-text><p>Committed to creating educational equity that will help lead to real, transformative change, UC Santa Cruz will launch an array of new programs to support the success of Latinx, low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students and prepare them for rewarding careers once they graduate.</p>
<p>"The HSI Initiatives focus on goals for strengthening the student experience and transforming our policies and practices to include and center students who have been and are minoritized in higher education," said Charis Herzon, director of HSI Initiatives. &#8220;We seek to achieve holistic student success, provide equitable educational interventions and student-centered practices, and create structures, changes, and institutional investments as a public research university to serve as a leader for the University of California and the nation.&#8221;</p>
<div class="callout-right narrow">
<h3>National Hispanic-Serving Institution Awareness Week</h3>
<p>National HSI Week is dedicated to celebrating and building awareness of the work and important role HSIs play in improving access to education, advancing equity practices, and the contributions in their communities. Visit the <a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu">HSI Initiatives website</a> or follow the team on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc.hsi/ ">Instagram @ucsc.hsi</a> to find out about programing this week, including webinars with grant updates for GANAS Career and GANAS Graduate, and a webinar specifically for graduate students to with our new Graduate Services Counselor Angel Domiguez.</p>
</div>
<p>UC Santa Cruz leaders are focused on creating lasting change across campus that will serve current and future students. Top campus leaders have continued to work closely with the Division of Student Affairs and Success and its Hispanic-Serving Institution Initiatives team.</p>
<p>In collaboration with scores of faculty and staff across campus, the Hispanic Serving Institution Initiatives team will be launching&#8212;and continuing&#8212;a range of programs and services to support undergraduate and graduate students in their academic success.&#160;</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz HSI team is focused on creating educational equity for undergraduate and graduate students and addressing disparities that have been created by differing families, economic backgrounds, and educational experiences. The campus faculty and staff strive to understand and design programs that account for and correct these disparities.</p>
<p>Herzon said much of the past year was spent planning the new programs so they would be ready for this academic year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our far-reaching collaborations and partnerships, both on campus and beyond, have been critical in the creativity involved in creating our grant activities and their successful implementation,&#8221; said Sara Sanchez, GANAS Graduate Program Director. &#8220;We create, plan, and execute in partnership and support of one another, enhancing the quality and reach of our initiatives&#8212;ultimately at the benefit of student success, including graduate student success with GANAS Graduate.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Advancing undergraduate educational equity</h2>
<p>Four new programs are supported by the campus's five-year $3 million Graduating New American Scholars (GANAS) Career Pathways grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Education last year.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus will offer a redesigned calculus course, provide supplemental instruction to support student learning, establish a new career internship program, and work with two departments to identify and address racial disparities.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has been focused on redesigning foundational math courses that have been barriers to student success, particularly in connection with the biology major. The campus is shifting courses away from large lectures to instead focus on active-learning and problem-solving sessions to support inclusiveness and equity. The HSI team has already redesigned Math 2, Math 3, and Math 11 A, and will turn its attention to Math 11B in summer 2022.&#160;</p>
<p>The comprehensive overhauls are meant to increase course grades and passing rates and reduce achievement gaps. In Math 2, previous to the redesign, pass rates hoverd between 70-75% with gaps between latinx (60% pass rate) and white students (90% pass rate) at over 30%. In Math 2, the pass rate is up to 85-90% and the gaps have been cut in half. In Math 3 we found that students from the redesigned math course who received the same grade as matched peers in the non-redesigned math course received higher grades in downstream STEM courses.&#160;</p>
<p>Learning Support Services will be delivering supplemental instruction in courses where there are high rates of students who have Ds, Fs, or are at risk of failing or withdrawing. Highly-trained student leaders will offer small-group sessions to help their peers with learning critical course material.&#160;<img alt="learning-support-services-500px.jpg" height="308" src="images/learning-support-services-500px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" width="500"/></p>
<p>A new career internship program focused on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) will invite students to apply later this fall. The students will be enrolled in a career course while also interning with nonprofits and businesses with the goal of helping to prepare the cohort to begin rewarding careers once they graduate.</p>
<p>Additionally, a team of faculty and staff experts will partner with the Linguistics Department and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Department to undertake a self-study meant to uncover and address equity gaps.&#160;</p>
<h2>Programs to support students to and through graduate school&#160;</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was also awarded a $3 million grant from the US Department of Education last fall to support graduate students.&#160;</p>
<p>The GANAS Graduate Pathways grant is helping to unleash the potential of UC Santa Cruz to be a leading Hispanic-serving research institution by advancing educational equity among graduate students. UCSC is one of only a couple dozen HSIs that also has "very high levels of research," as measured by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning.&#160;</p>
<p>A new course, supported by the grant, will help undergraduates in applying and preparing for graduate school. The project is meant to help expand the pipeline of undergraduate students who decide to pursue an advanced degree and ensure they have the tools to succeed.</p>
<p>The campus will also be offering a training course in the arts for undergraduate and graduate students that is focused on having successful careers in the creative economy.&#160;</p>
<p>A new graduate service counselor, Angel Dominguez, will provide holistic advising with expertise in supporting first generation, historically low-income and BIPOC students.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus&#8217;s Latinx Initiative for Future Teachers (LIFT) will provide Latinx scholars interested in teaching with a streamlined pathway to the Master&#8217;s in Education and Teaching Credential (MA/C) Program, as well as mentorship and financial support while they are in the program.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has also established the VOCES Graduate Student Writing Center, which provides Latinx, low-income, first-generation, and graduate students of color an array of writing strategies designed to address conceptual thinking, reading/literacy, and multiple forms of writing throughout graduate school.</p>
<p>The HSI team is planning to launch several more efforts in summer 2022, including a research opportunity program for students from UCSC and CSU Monterey Bay; a first-year experience course for incoming graduate students studying literature to expose them to different kinds of research; and a summer bridge program to support incoming graduate students.&#160;</p>
<h2>Creating lasting change&#160;</h2>
<p>Herzon said HSI grants help to create transformational change at UC Santa Cruz both by creating positive changes in the academic landscape and by establishing new programs that can continue beyond the term of a grant.&#160;</p>
<p>This includes sustaining positions such as the Chicanx/Latinx Resources Center Program Coordinator that was initially funded by the MAPA grant. That grant ended in September 2020 with the campus now funding that position. Building transfer pathways with programs such as cross-enrollment are also set to continue this year under a soon-to-be-hired Cultivamos Excelencia Director.&#160;</p>
<p>With students returning to in-person instruction the STEM Hub in the Science Library will be where students can find EOP Advising and Learning Support Services learning sessions.</p>
<p>The campus's <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/hsi-student-success.html">SEMILLA grant, a $5.7 million grant awarded in fall 2016</a>, is ending this year. That grant helped Latinx students pursue STEM degrees and instructors clear barriers to success inside and outside the classroom. The grant funded programs in math, writing, career development, and more.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus will continue to run its SEMILLA scholars program--supporting first-year students who are planning to major in a STEM field by providing additional counseling, helping them get familiar with their major and fostering a sense of belonging.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall we have had successes and we still have a lot of work to do,&#8221; Herzon said. &#8220;We have been successful in developing race-conscious, equity-minded, faculty and staff practitioners. These practitioners regularly review disaggregated data and seek to understand our students' experience at UCSC with curiosity, vulnerability, with the intent and ability to take action. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are happy to report that our change in practices and policies benefit Latinx students and in our analysis, we have found that they benefit all students. We look forward to implementing the new programs and partnering with our students and their journey as we start this new academic year.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e5fd6e21807270466cc00b0055388dee"><name>graffiti-street-art</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The writing on the wall: exploring the cultural value of graffiti and street art</title><summary>Doctoral candidate’s research interprets graffiti’s deeper meaning among Latinx and Black urban subcultures in Los Angeles. </summary><start-date>1631602800000</start-date><path>/2021/09/graffiti-street-art</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/graffiti-street-art</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1631651196406</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1631814720598</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>hispanic-heritage</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/illescas2_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/illescas2_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>illescas2_250.jpg</name><display-name>illescas2_250.jpg</display-name><file-size>78631</file-size><width>250</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Illescas posing outdoors in front of a colorful mural painting</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/illescas_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/illescas_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>illescas_80.jpg</name><display-name>illescas_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25802</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Illescas posing outdoors in front of a colorful mural painting</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Doctoral candidate&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ismael Illescas&#160;gathered insights from current and former graffiti writers about how their work connects with concepts of art, identity, culture, and space. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Doctoral candidate’s research interprets graffiti’s deeper meaning among Latinx and Black urban subcultures in Los Angeles </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ismael Illescas grew up admiring the graffiti around his neighborhood in Los Angeles. He had migrated to the city with his mother and brother from Ecuador in the 1990s as part of a large Latin American diaspora. In his urban environment, he found himself surrounded by beautiful, cryptic messages. They were written on walls and scrawled daringly across billboards. Little by little, he began to understand the meanings behind some of these messages. And, eventually, he started writing back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illescas became a graffiti writer himself, for a time. He has since given it up, but he never lost his initial sense of curiosity and admiration. In fact, now, as a doctoral candidate in Latin American and Latino Studies, his dissertation research has taken him back to Los Angeles, where he gathered insights from current and former graffiti writers about how their work connects with concepts of art, identity, culture, and space.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who create it, graffiti is an expression of identity and an outlet for creativity, social connection, and achievement, according to Illescas&#8217;s research. Some of the most popular graffiti yards in Los Angeles are abandoned spaces in communities of color that neither the economy nor the city has been willing to invest in, he says. But graffiti allows Black and Latino young men to transform these areas into spaces of congregation and empowerment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In a city where these youth are marginalised, ostracized, and invisibilized, graffiti is a way for them to become visible,&#8221; Illescas said. &#8220;They feel that the system is against them, and upward social mobility is limited for them, so putting their names up around the city is a way for them to achieve respect from their peers and assert their dignity, and that doesn&#8217;t come easily from other places and institutions in society.&#8221;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graffiti also offers what Illescas calls an &#8220;illicit cartography,&#8221; meaning that it can be read like a cultural map of the city. Graffiti styles in East Los Angeles, for example, reflect Mexican-American artistic influence that began with Pachuco counterculture in the 1940s. Rich graffiti writing traditions emerged, including &#8220;placas,&#8221; or tags that list a writer&#8217;s stylized signature, and &#8220;barrio calligraphy,&#8221; which blends rolling scripts with Old English lettering. In the 1980s, those traditions then incorporated colorful, whimsical East Coast influences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The result is that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles has a really unique graffiti style,&#8221; Illescas said. &#8220;Although outsiders might not necessarily notice it, you can easily see the Mexican-American artistic influence in the aesthetics, and that has become associated with Latinx urban identities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graffiti is a multiracial and multi-ethnic subculture, and Illescas says his research aims to recognize the specific contributions of Black and Latinx communities. He&#8217;s also critically examining the subculture&#8217;s hypermasculinity and how that may limit its transformative potential.&#160; And he&#8217;s particularly interested in shedding light on how race may affect public perceptions of graffiti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the context, graffiti can either be publicly admired as &#8220;street art&#8221;&#8212;and valued up to millions of dollars&#8212;or it can be criminalized at levels ranging up to felony charges and years of jail time. In Los Angeles, a city which many researchers consider to be highly racially segregated, Black and Latinx communities, like South Central Los Angeles and East Los Angeles, are the places where graffiti is most likely to be severely criminalized and lumped together with gang activity, Illescas says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Illescas says street art is more likely to be recognized as such within arts districts, where officially sanctioned &#8220;beautification&#8221; projects use public art to attract more business and new residents, which can contribute to gentrification issues. And some of the most famous street artists are actually white men, like Banksy or Shepard Fairey, who have each attained international recognition for the artistic value of their illegal works.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is where systemic racism occurs,&#8221; Illescas said. &#8220;You have some people who are more prone to being criminalized and severely punished for a very similar act, and that punishment falls mainly on young Black and Latino men.&#8221;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons, Illescas has found that many graffiti writers of color have mixed feelings about the growing public appreciation for street art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On the one hand, it&#8217;s a capitalistic appropriation of transgressive graffiti into commercialized street art,&#8221; Illescas said. &#8220;But it also ties into the efforts of graffiti writers who have been pushing for years to decriminalize their art and demonstrate its artistic and social value and the types of knowledge that it brings with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Street art has, in fact, already brought opportunities for some veteran Black and Latino graffiti writers, who told Illescas they had recently been commissioned for their art or had found jobs as tour guides in arts districts. But each of these artists got their start creating illegal graffiti tags. Illescas believes that decriminalization will ultimately require transforming public appreciation of street art into a deeper understanding of the expressive value of other forms of graffiti. And he hopes his research might aid in that process.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The graffiti that we see up in the streets may seem like an insignificant tag or scribble to some people, but there&#8217;s a lot of meaning behind it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There needs to be a recognition that graffiti is actually a visual representation of someone&#8217;s identity, and it&#8217;s also potentially their starting point to a very meaningful artistic career.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e6328fff807270466cc00b002dddbc1f"><name>keynote-hispanic-heritage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month</title><summary>September provides our campus with two platforms to recognize the achievements and contributions of Hispanic and Latinx Americans and share with the public the important role UC Santa Cruz and other universities play in creating educational equity. &#13;

<p>Hispanic Heritage Month, which kicks off tomorrow, celebrates the many contributions and cultures of Hispanic and Latinx Americans. National Hispanic Serving Institutions Awareness Week, which began Monday, allows HSIs like UC Santa Cruz to highlight the critical role they play in educating and empowering Latinx students.&#160;</p>
<p>In observing both, we pay tribute to the generations of Latinx Americans who have advanced our nation and society, while we also spotlight the work taking place on our campus to foster and support the next generation of Latinx leaders.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, we are proud to be a Hispanic Serving Institution, a designation from the U.S. Department of Education for an institution that has enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent students that is at least 25 percent Hispanic. Our Latinx students, as well as our Latinx staff, faculty and managers, are a vital part of what makes our university a rich and multicultural institution of higher learning. We are especially proud to be one of only four HSIs in the nation &#8212; there are 569 &#8212; that are also members of the esteemed Association of American Universities, an organization composed of North America's 66 leading research universities</p>
<p>Our campus is set to launch a host of new programs &#8212; while continuing others already in place &#8212; that support the success of our Latinx, low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students. The efforts of our Hispanic Serving Institution Initiatives team, working in collaboration with faculty and staff across campus, are detailed in a story in today&#8217;s Tuesday Newsday, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/hsi-programs.html">&#8220;Pairing research excellence and status as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz launching new programs to advance educational equity.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Look for stories on our newscenter through this next month that recognize the positive and transformative influence of Latinx culture in our society and highlight work being done by our faculty and students that promote the cross-cultural exchange of ideas. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Chemistry professor Laura Sanchez recently <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/sanchez-laura-profile.html">took part in the inaugural Breaking Barriers Through Chemistry Conference</a>. The conference&#8217;s goal is to bring together professors from across that field to establish, strengthen, and promote research collaborations between institutions in Mexico, United States, and Europe.&#160;</li>

</ul>
<p>The roots of Hispanic Heritage Month date to 1968. The Sept. 15 start-date was chosen because it is the anniversary of independence of five Hispanic nations: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, all of which declared their independence on that day in 1821. Mexico, Chile and Belize also celebrate their independence days this month.</p>
<p>As a university that believes our high-quality education can be a pathway to future success in life, we champion this month as an opportunity to educate our community about Hispanic and Latinx heritage and honor the rich cultural traditions of Hispanic and Latinx Americans.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e63ceaac807270466cc00b00d1075e75"><name>campus-goals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recommitting to strengthening student success was the prevailing theme of campus leadership gathering</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz leaders discussed multi-dimensional, campuswide strategies to strengthen the undergraduate and graduate experience to support the success of students and help prepare them for successful careers and meaningful lives after graduation. </summary><start-date>1631602800000</start-date><display-name>Campus leadership gathering</display-name><path>/2021/09/campus-goals</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/campus-goals</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1631655357079</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1631738401139</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/students-college-nine-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/students-college-nine-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>students-college-nine-500px.jpg</name><display-name>students-college-nine-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>307673</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Students at College Nine</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/student-success-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/student-success-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>student-success-80px.jpg</name><display-name>student-success-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>21489</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A group of students at College Nine</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz is developing a multidimensional strategy to support students, focusing on holistic student support centered on equity and well-being.&#160;(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz is striving to increase retention and graduation rates while eliminating achievement gaps</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz leaders discussed multi-dimensional, campuswide strategies to strengthen the undergraduate and graduate experience to support the success of students and help prepare them for successful careers and meaningful lives after graduation.&#160;</p>
<p>At the first in-person leadership team gathering since the COVID-pandemic began, deans, vice provosts, vice chancellors, department chairs and managers, Academic Senate leaders and administrators from across campus today gathered to discuss opportunities for the year ahead as the campus prepares for the new academic year.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is the future of higher education,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This university is leading at the intersection of creativity, innovation, and justice.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Larive reaffirmed the campus goals to advance student success by improving retention and graduation rates and closing equity gaps; increase its research profile and impact; foster an inclusive campus climate that embraces and values diversity and equity; and improve efficiency, effectiveness, and resilience.&#160;</p>
<p>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, along with Associate Vice Chancellor for Budget Analysis and Planning provided a budget overview that included significant good news about the fiscal year 2022 campus budget outlook. The $20 million permanent fiscal year 2021 budget cut has been restored for fiscal year 2022 and the campus will receive a $9.1 million (4.5 percent) permanent increase for mandatory costs; $318,000 based on enrollment growth and $1.2 million to support student mental health.&#160;</p>
<p>The fiscal year 2022 budget also provides an additional $4.8 million for our campus as part of a multi-year plan that aims to bring the unweighted per-student funding level for UCR, UCSB and UCSC to 95 percent of the average systemwide allocation. This budget adjustment honors a pre-COVID agreement by the Council of Chancellors to help counter the heavier weighting of Health Sciences graduate students and residents in the system&#8217;s funding allocation formula.</p>
<p>In addition to these permanent funding increases, the budget includes important one-time allocations. The $6.6 million in deferred maintenance funding that was cut in spring 2020 has been restored and is being augmented with an additional $22.7 million, of which 60 percent must target energy efficiency projects. The budget presentation also touched on the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial relief provided by the federal government through Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds, which provided many students with additional financial aid and helped fund instructional support for our campus.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;After the challenges of the past year, this positive budget news is so welcome,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;The increases to our permanent budget, especially the additional $4.8 million to better align the state funding our campus receives with the systemwide per-student average will go a long way in helping us achieve our student success goals. A UC Santa Cruz education can change the trajectory of a student&#8217;s life&#8212;but they need to earn a diploma for it to have the strongest impact. I&#8217;m proud to see the whole campus refocusing on supporting our students, from the moment they enroll to well after they graduate.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Advancing student success</h3>
<p>Kletzer discussed the campus&#8217;s need to boost retention and graduation rates, while also eliminating equity gaps that exist among students. The need to strengthen graduation rates is affirmed by the latest rankings by US News and World Report (USNWR). While UC Santa Cruz continues to be among the top 15 universities for social mobility and top 50 public universities, the rankings also show that graduation rates are behind peer institutions. The six-year graduation rate at UC Santa Cruz in the most recent USNWR rankings is 76 percent.</p>
<p>Interim Vice Chancellor Jennifer Baszile shared an overview of a multidimensional strategy to support students, focusing on holistic student support centered on equity and well-being. This strategy will be developed over the course of this year through a strategic plan, with implementation, by the Division of Student Affairs and Success. &#160;</p>
<p>The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning is helping to share and support inclusive teaching practices and leading the redesign of key courses.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;By creating a culture of continuous evaluation and assessment we will be able to sustain a holistic approach to student engagement and belonging, two pillars of our approach to institutional transformation,&#8221; Baszile said. &#8220;We are laying a strong foundation to make a national impact as one of the few R1, Minority Serving Institutions that is also a member of the AAU.</p>
<p>To better serve graduate students, the <a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/enhanced-programs/index.html">campus announced a number</a> of new programs focused on housing, cost reduction, student success, and family support.&#160;</p>
<h2>Increasing the research profile and impact</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, UC Santa Cruz increased research grants and contracts by 7 percent during fiscal year 2021 to more than $159 million. The campus will continue to support single investigator grants while also offering enhanced support for faculty efforts to submit larger high impact interdisciplinary proposals including those that target funding for centers and institutes. To spur these efforts, a seed fund competition will be launched this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is well positioned to capitalize on increases in federal funding in areas of strength, such as climate change, energy, human health and behavioral science,&#8221; said interim Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan. &#8220;We look to bring together interdisciplinary teams to tackle the biggest problems facing society.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacMillan said the campus is also developing a unified business engagement strategy centered on the Innovation and Business Engagement Hub to advance our research impact by supporting entrepreneurship, commercialization of UCSC discoveries and increased funding from corporate partners.&#160;</p>
<h2>Fostering inclusivity</h2>
<p>Maintaining a campus community in which everyone feels welcome and included is critical, Larive said. Over the past year, the campus has made several structural changes to strengthen diversity, equity and inclusion.&#160;</p>
<p>The new Office of Equity and Equal Protection, headed by AVC Isabel Dees, manages all complaints of discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics, which will enable the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to prioritize its work to proactively serve and support the campus community. Additionally, the transition to Division of Student Affairs and Success structure has elevated student affairs expertise and transformed the way the campus supports students.&#160;</p>
<p>Larive also shared that the campus is exploring the establishment of an ombuds office that could incorporate and augment UCSC&#8217;s conflict resolution model.&#160;</p>
<p>As announced earlier in September, UC Santa Cruz has already begun reimagining campus safety by establishing a tiered safety model and shifting resources to other campus units and developing alternative safety support mechanisms, including a critical response team for mental health calls and a sobering station.&#160;</p>
<h2>Efficient, effective, and resilient&#160;</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has made strides toward greater efficiency and effectiveness, with the adoption of a campuswide task management system and better communication, Larive said, while noting that there are more gains to be made.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus is systematically updating legacy programs and tools that are outdated and make data sharing difficult, while also addressing processes that are cumbersome and manual. The campus will be asking units to ensure they have up-to-date business continuity plans so operations can continue even amid disruptions.&#160;</p>
<p>A recent survey of UC employees showed campus improvements in communication, leadership and organizational change and innovation. The areas of concern among staff continue to be salary and retention.&#160;</p>
<p>Staff retention and engagement are critical to creating a more resilient campus, and Larive previewed a new staff compensation equity plan that was announced to non-represented staff today.&#160;</p>
<p>Over the next three years, UC Santa Cruz will be investing $5.5 million to address historic salary issues. The program will target employees who have met expectations, whose salaries are furthest behind market, and will predominantly impact employees in lower salary grades. Larive also said the campus must hire staff at an appropriate level of pay and that any recruitments with salaries below the 25th percentile will require review by the compensation team in Staff Human Resources.&#160;</p>
<p>Larive recognized that more work needs to be done&#8212;particularly as it relates to housing. The campus is adding more housing for students through the Kresge College renewal, and once it clears the courts, Student Housing West will significantly increase the number of housing units for undergraduate and graduate students.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus is also making plans to initiate the development of new employee housing. This work has evolved from the efforts of the Employee Housing Workgroup, using data that emerged from the 2020 employee housing survey. The initial focus is on Ranch View Terrace 2, and work has been done over summer to examine various density considerations. The new Long Range Development Plan, set for review by the Board of Regents in September, has also identified additional employee housing locations which are being reviewed for projects. In addition, the campus is exploring potential opportunities to address other barriers of entry into the housing market for employees, such as down payment assistance or other similar programs.</p>
<p>The campus is continuing on its unprecedented trajectory, and the year ahead will be a time to celebrate as the campus resumes in-person activities.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC has an extraordinary opportunity to change the world through our students, our research and our public service. To deliver on that promise, we must work together intentionally and in alignment, and we must thoughtfully assess our progress,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;Our vision and goals are the foundation for telling the story of our amazing university.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ea10fef4807270466cc00b0003d21e09"><name>compensation-for-non-represented-staff</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three-year Equity Compensation Program for non-represented staff</title><summary>Today we are sharing our decision to implement specific changes to staff compensation practices for non-represented staff, building on the work of our staff compensation task force and acknowledging the voices of other campus advocates.</summary><start-date>1631602800000</start-date><display-name>Three-year Equity Compensation Program for non-represented staff</display-name><path>/2021/09/compensation-for-non-represented-staff</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/compensation-for-non-represented-staff</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1631719587554</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1631836015121</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we welcome students back to campus in the coming week, we know the tremendous amount of work that has gone into making this moment possible &#8212; plus the efforts undertaken over the past year in advancing our education, research and service mission. UC Santa Cruz continues to lead at the intersection of creativity, innovation and social impact because of the collective efforts of the entire campus community.</p>
<p>As we work to advance our mission and increase our impact, we know that staff compensation is a crucial area in need of improvement. Today we are sharing our decision to implement specific changes to staff compensation practices for non-represented staff, building on the work of our staff compensation task force and acknowledging the voices of other campus advocates.</p>
<p>First, we are making explicit a compensation philosophy that describes our intentions and a framework for how we will manage this important human resource practice. Our philosophy going forward will include these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC Santa Cruz recruits, develops, and retains a well-qualified and engaged workforce that reflects our commitment to diversity, inclusion, innovation, and accountability while fostering the university&#8217;s research, teaching, and service mission. UC Santa Cruz makes staff employee compensation practices transparent and motivating.</li>
<li>We will be as competitive as possible relative to the market given our resources, and we will continually monitor our pay practices to ensure they align with our mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, to begin increasing our actual pay levels in accordance with our philosophy, we are investing $5.5 million over three years in an equity program covering our approximately 1,700 non-represented staff. The key aspects of this plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program will target employees whose salaries are furthest below market, and will predominantly impact employees in lower salary grades. Not everyone will receive an adjustment and increases will vary according to each participant&#8217;s individual pay circumstances.</li>
<li>The purpose of the program is to make our pay practices more competitive compared to the market and provide an incentive for staff to continue their careers at UC Santa Cruz.</li>
<li>The equity adjustments will be effective Dec. 26, 2021, for bi-weekly paid staff, which will be reflected in their Jan. 19, 2022 paychecks. The effective date for monthly paid staff is Jan. 1, 2022, which will be reflected in their Feb. 1, 2022 paychecks.</li>
<li>The $5.5 million will be invested as follows: $2.5 million in 2022 and $1.5 million in each of the following two years.</li>
<li>Our staff HR compensation team will provide the divisions with a roster of eligible employees. The divisions will review and collaborate with the compensation team to identify any outstanding issues for the employees listed on the roster (<em>i.e.</em>pending disciplinary actions or an expected evaluation rating of less than &#8220;met expectations&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
<p>A third category of compensation changes include these additional new practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new hires in non-represented roles will have their starting salaries set at no lower than the 25th percentile of their salary grades. Exceptions can be considered in consultation with your compensation analyst and based on unique circumstances. We have many existing staff in the lowest quartile simply as a consequence of units offering low starting salaries. This new practice will help us maintain our progress and continue to advance equitable compensation practices for our non-represented staff.</li>
<li>Beginning in 2022, we request that units engage in an annual &#8220;focal review&#8221; with their compensation analyst to address equity considerations at one point in the year. Conducting equity reviews on an annual basis helps to streamline the process, allows managers to review their unit/s holistically, applies reasoning that is fair and consistent, aligns increases with the merit cycle and sets clear expectations for staff. We recommend that any equity actions resulting from the focal review have an effective date of July 1. This date aligns with what has been the typical merit effective date.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus during the Move-In period. This can create significant challenges for the campus community, particularly on Thursday and Friday.

We approached fall quarter as a transitional quarter, returning predominantly to in-person instruction from pandemic remote. We recognize there may be apprehension about resuming in-person instruction - we are committed to doing so and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631824074945000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0tXfZeUcPxeu9AJlnbINIsxhT5g" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/fall-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we are committed to the significant health and well-being measures put in place to mitigate risk</a>.

<p>For winter quarter, the instructional modality for all classes will be in person except as noted below. There are three exceptions to winter quarter in-person instruction. First, those instructors with a disability who want to request an accommodation that does not involve teaching in person in winter 2022 can contact Disability Manager Kelly Roberts (<a href="mailto:roberts@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roberts@ucsc.edu</a> ) and Director of Academic Employee Relations Danny Gray ( <a href="mailto:dggray@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dggray@ucsc.edu</a> ) in order to initiate the disability accommodation process.</p>
<p>Second, instructors with a household member at high risk for COVID, such that under the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631824074946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6oUg6obF8vWrNk3vyvPRRZ6-bcA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2, 2021 CDC guidelines</a> they would be eligible for an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose (a &#8220;booster&#8221;), may request a modification to their work duties and responsibilities, per the recent <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/guidance-instructors.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631824074946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6ka_kWdiwSPMQzSZdoHQFvYmQHg" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/guidance-instructors.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">communication</a>. This process, just announced for fall quarter, will also apply to winter 2022. In order to receive this consideration, the instructor must submit their request, along with <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apo.ucsc.edu/covid-19/ucsc_immunocompromised_household_member_form.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631824074946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLyL-guPl4dpLmPmt8_ArFAlpuLw" href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/covid-19/ucsc_immunocompromised_household_member_form.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this form</a>, filled out by themselves and their household member&#8217;s health care provider, to <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apo@ucsc.edu</a> as soon as possible. Additionally, the instructor&#8217;s department chair, college provost, or program director, as appropriate, must submit a letter directly to <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apo@ucsc.edu</a> stating the learning objectives of the course being requested to be shifted to remote, and the chair&#8217;s opinion on whether the learning objectives can reasonably be met through a remote modality. It is the instructor&#8217;s responsibility to request this letter from their department chair.</p>
<p>Finally, as was the case pre-pandemic, courses may be offered in a hybrid or fully online modality for pedagogical reasons. These modalities require approval from the Senate Committee on Courses of Instruction (CCI). Please note that online courses will NOT be approved because of COVID accommodations. Also, required courses for undergraduate majors and minors, as well as graduate degrees must be taught in-person at least once during any academic year in which they are offered. As has been done in previous quarters, a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://online.ucsc.edu/call-for-proposals-the-development-of-online-and-hybrid-courses-for-winter-2022/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631824074946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEe201Jb69vFHNPn39D3-KRFUGOGg" href="https://online.ucsc.edu/call-for-proposals-the-development-of-online-and-hybrid-courses-for-winter-2022/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">call for proposals</a> is now open for faculty who seek support to teach in online or hybrid formats in winter &#8217;22.</p>
<p>These guidelines apply to primary sections (main lectures). Secondary sections ( <em>e.g.</em> , discussion sections) should be treated similarly to primary sections, although CCI approval is not required for the offering of remote sections for pedagogical reasons. Some instructors and students have found learning benefits of remote sections, and depending on the course learning objectives, in some classes it may be appropriate to offer a mix of in-person and remote sections. Course sponsoring agencies should work with their dean&#8217;s office on determining modalities for secondary sections.</p>
<p>As we return to operating as an in-person university, we will continue to follow public health requirements and guidance. I thank you for your flexibility, resilience, and partnership and for your commitment to the continued success of our students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed00e749807270466cc00b00292d76b3"><name>schaeffer--presidential-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Felicity Schaeffer named Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies</title><summary>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, the new Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies, plans to address the most pressing issues of the department’s focus on social justice.</summary><keywords>feminist studies, social justice,  humanities news, , Afghan scholars, history, politics, critical race and ethnic studies, women, gender, equal rights, UCOP, education, health, government, academics, university news, higher education </keywords><start-date>1631771700000</start-date><display-name>Schaeffer: Baskin Feminist Studies Presidential Chair </display-name><path>/2021/09/schaeffer--presidential-chair</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/schaeffer--presidential-chair</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1631768864568</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1631833705867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>womens-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/felicity-schaeffer-550-levels.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/felicity-schaeffer-550-levels.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>felicity-schaeffer-550-levels.jpg</name><display-name>felicity-schaeffer-550-levels.jpg</display-name><file-size>181125</file-size><width>550</width><height>403</height></image><image-alt>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/schaeffer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/schaeffer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>schaeffer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>schaeffer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23742</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>New endowed chair plans to address the most pressing issues of the department’s focus on social justice
</article-subhead><article-text><div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">
<p><span>Feminist Studies professor Felicity Amaya Schaeffer has been appointed as the new Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies.</span></p>
<p><span>The endowed chair was established in 2017 with a $500,000 gift from the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation and matching funds from the UC Regents. The appointment is for a three-year period, running through June 30, 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The president of the University of California supports Presidential Chairs on each of the 10 UC campuses through an endowment established in 1981 by the UC Regents.</span></p>
<p><span>The positions are offered to distinguished members of the university's faculty and are intended to encourage new or interdisciplinary program development or to enhance quality in existing academic programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Schaeffer said funds from the endowed chair will help support research and teaching in feminist studies, graduate and undergraduate students, and campus events.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;During my three-year term, I plan to use the funds to address the most pressing issues relevant to our department&#8217;s focus on social justice in a transnational world,&#8221; said Schaeffer. &#8220;For example, with the support of our graduate student Halima Kazem and faculty and staff from across campus, we are working on bringing a Visiting Scholar from Afghanistan who has fought for the rights of women and girls in education, health, the academy, and government.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This is an unusual opportunity to reflect on the U.S. role in militarized empire and policing around the world and the effects it has on the most outspoken and vulnerable populations,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I can see us building courses and planning events that help us understand these complex political climates in a historical, comparative, and critical context that thinks about the relations between war, policing, and ICE as it affects those on the ground, as well as the activism that is sending rippling changes in how we imagine a better future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Schaeffer says she plans to continue the legacy of emerita professor Bettina Aptheker, who was the inaugural Chair of the Baskin Endowment from 2017 to 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;During her stewardship, Professor Aptheker brought many prominent scholars and activists to campus to inspire new ways of understanding the long history of sexual assault on women and racial and gendered struggle for rights. Like Aptheker, I intend to enrich the campus intellectual community by bringing inspiring voices from the margins to center stage. And I plan on continuing to organize events that bring the campus and surrounding communities around Santa Cruz together to showcase how our department can work with these broader communities to effect changes that touch all of our lives.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>A professor in the Feminist Studies Department for over 16 years, Schaeffer has played a key role in supporting the Baskin Feminist Scholars Program, also funded by the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation and now entering its 5th year at UCSC.&#160;</span><span>The program is designed to attract and retain local transfer students to Feminist Studies, while also providing underserved populations with the opportunity to pursue a Feminist Studies degree.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I am passionate about the many ways the Feminist faculty deeply alter conversations across many fields of knowledge, especially driven by our commitment to thinking about the structural conditions and knowledges that reinforce inequalities,&#8221; said Schaeffer. &#8220;With the support of the Baskin Endowed Chair, we have the opportunity to create events that share our critical insight and hope for radically different futures with the campus as well as the broader community of Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Vaccinated students living on campus must get a COVID-19 test within five to seven days of moving to UC Santa Cruz. Vaccinated students who live off campus must get a test by Sept. 30. Unvaccinated students must continue to be tested at least once every four days throughout the quarter, commencing with their arrival on campus.</p>
<p>Testing is voluntary for vaccinated employees who live, work or come on-site for any reason. Unvaccinated staff and faculty who come on-site for any reason are also required to test at least every four days.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will continue to provide free and easy voluntarily asymptomatic testing for employees as frequently as they desire. To help our Slug family understand testing requirements and availability, we are reaching out to provide more information on how and where to get tested.</p>

<p>The solar photovoltaic canopy will provide the campus with clean, reliable electricity for at least 20-years and save the campus an estimated $6 million on its energy bill. The array will generate enough energy to meet about 6% of our total campus electrical load.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a major step towards directly reducing the campus&#8217; carbon footprint. As climate change impacts become more of a reality in all of our day-to-day lives, I am also encouraged that the chancellor is committed to exploring more options for future renewable energy projects on campus to keep us moving in the right direction,&#8221; said Elida Erickson, director of the Office of Sustainability.&#160;</p>
<p>The project will generate more than three million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each year, enough to power more than 330 houses for a year, according to EPA calculations.</p>
<p>The campus is installing a battery storage system, set to be online later this academic year, that will allow the campus to store 1 megawatt of energy to reduce peak demand and shift load to times of day when electricity is less costly. The intelligent use of energy from the storage units combined with on-site solar energy generation helps maximize clean energy utilization and enhances&#160; grid performance.</p>
<p>The campus partnered with ForeFront Power for the project through a streamlined procurement process offered by the School Project for Utility Rate Reduction, part of the Utilities Joint Powers Authority of California Public Schools.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz also has a 250 kilowatt photovoltaic array on the McHenry Library, which provides 25 percent of the annual electrical energy needed for the building. It also provides 75 to 100 percent of the power needed for the building during peak times of year.

<p>The 2017&#8211;2022 Campus Sustainability Plan calls on UC Santa Cruz to develop a plan to add four megawatts of solar photovoltaic to the campus and the new solar array gets the campus halfway to that goal.&#160;</p>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning, Development and Operations is currently assessing the opportunities for solar at UCSC&#8217;s Westside Research Park and Monterey Bay Education Science and Technology (MBEST) Center.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4f0313d807270466cc00b00b2506afc"><name>back-up-care-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus launches back-up care program</title><summary>We are delighted to announce that the new UC Santa Cruz subsidized back-up care program for employees and students is now officially up and running.</summary><start-date>1631862000000</start-date><display-name>Campus launches back-up care program</display-name><path>/2021/09/back-up-care-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/back-up-care-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1631901987111</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1631901987111</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are delighted to announce that the new <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631984753273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTmtGiCLvWUjQ4XPeCEerhJD7gUQ" href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz subsidized back-up care program</a> for employees and students is now officially up and running.</p>
<p>Back-up care &#8212; both child care and elder care &#8212; was identified as an urgent need in a 2020 campus Family Services Workgroup survey of employees and students. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of having this crucial support structure in place. The benefit is obvious. It relieves stress on caregiving employees and students in the event of an unexpected care emergency, giving them peace of mind that their loved ones will be safe and properly cared for while the employee or student is at work or school. This is critical to both student and employee success.</p>
<p>Bright Horizons is operating the program, and has created a network of in-home care providers and child-care centers across the region that UCSC employees and students can utilize.</p>
<p>Each eligible employee and student who registers for the program will be allotted 15 uses per year. Employees and students will be responsible for a copay per use, and the campus will cover the rest of the cost. The copay per use for employees will be $10 per child, or $15 per family, for center-based back-up care, and $4 per hour for in-home care (for up to 10 hours/day for up to three children). The copay per use for students will be $5 per child, or $10 per family, for center-based back-up care and $2 per hour for in-home care.</p>
<p>Since the care is provided at a cost less than the market rate for these services, the difference between the market rate and the copay is treated by the IRS as additional income, also known as imputed income, and is taxable. The employee or student who has used the back-up care program is required to pay taxes on the imputed income.</p>
<p>The need for back-up care is obviously difficult to predict, so we urge employees and students who think they may utilize the program at some point to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://my.brighthorizons.com/?clientguid%3DD4F60E23-CCC2-EA11-A84B-005056996B9F&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631984753273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHT17KN2Ytjf703c0Uj9dP_YFq0zQ" href="https://my.brighthorizons.com/?clientguid=D4F60E23-CCC2-EA11-A84B-005056996B9F" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proactively set up an account</a>, download the mobile app, and familiarize yourself with the program now so you are ready to go in case of a care emergency.</p>

<p>The laboratory was launched in May 2020 to provide COVID-19 testing services for the UCSC Student Health Center and other medical providers in the local community. After a rapid start-up in provisional laboratory space on the UCSC campus, the lab has since expanded its testing capacity and moved to a permanent location at UCSC&#8217;s Westside Research Park on Delaware Avenue.</p>
<p>Since 1999, the Community Health Trust of Pajaro Valley has been honoring Phil Rather&#8217;s legacy of service to the community through the Phil Rather Award for Leadership in Healthcare. This year&#8217;s awards ceremony took place on Saturday, September 18, at the Seascape Golf Club. Awards were granted to those who made the most outstanding contributions to health in Pajaro Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to celebrate these leaders who rose to the challenge and made a difference in the community,&#8221; said DeAndre James, executive director of the Community Health Trust. &#8220;These organizations and individuals are doing remarkable work, addressing challenges only magnified by the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>CHT will be donating $500 grants on behalf of each of the awardees, to the charity of their choice. In addition to the Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory, awardees included Watsonville Campesino Appreciation Caravan, Paulina Moreno, Paz Padilla, Erica Padilla-Chavez, Tamara Vides, and Nancy Faulstich. And receiving the first ever Phil Rather Lifetime Achievement Award for Leadership in Healthcare, for a life and career devoted to creating health equity and wellness for all, Dr. Wells Shoemaker.</p>
<p>Founded in 1998 and serving a tri-county area, the Community Health Trust is recognized for its leadership as a convener in the South Santa Cruz County area. CHT is motivated to foster an equitable Pajaro Valley with health, wellness and a full quality of life for all through access to resources, activities, and choices that help prevent illness and improve quality of life.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="040d3050807270466cc00b000aff387f"><name>aau-hsi-discussion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>With AAU, HSI distinctions, UC Santa Cruz to join in discussion on serving, supporting Latinx students</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz—one of only four universities that is both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and a member of the Association of American Universities—will be represented in a panel discussion, “A Critical Dialogue on Leading Innovation, Scholarship, and Solutions Centered on Servingness.”</summary><start-date>1632121200000</start-date><display-name>AAU, HSI discussion</display-name><path>/2021/09/aau-hsi-discussion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/aau-hsi-discussion</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1632155545659</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632164247835</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/event-banner.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/event-banner.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>event-banner.jpg</name><display-name>event-banner.jpg</display-name><file-size>48528</file-size><width>820</width><height>410</height></image><image-alt>Flier for AAU-HSI discussion with text about the event</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8212;one of only four universities that is both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and a member of the Association of American Universities&#8212;will be represented in a panel discussion, &#8220;A Critical Dialogue on Leading Innovation, Scholarship, and Solutions Centered on Servingness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The UC Santa Cruz HSI team is focused on creating educational equity for undergraduate and graduate students and addressing disparities that have been created by differing families, economic backgrounds, and educational experiences. The campus faculty and staff strive to understand and design programs that account for and correct these disparities.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/hsi-programs.html">scores of faculty and staff across campus</a>, the Hispanic Serving Institution Initiatives team will be launching&#8212;and continuing&#8212;a range of programs and services to support undergraduate and graduate students in their academic success.</p>
<p>Enrollment of Latinx undergraduates surpassed 25 percent in 2012, making UC Santa Cruz the third UC to become a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) according to the U.S. Department of Education definition. Reaching this milestone enabled the university to join the Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities (HACU) as a member institution, and to eventually apply for federal grants focused on advancing educational equity and strengthening support for Latinx students and other underrepresented and low-income students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="048c983e807270466cc00b00a185acfa"><name>postdoctoral-week</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Postdoctoral scholars critical in advancing research mission</title><summary>With experience, training, and ideas of their own, postdoctoral scholars play an important role in furthering research at universities.&#13;

<p>&#8220;These major contributions to research bring more publications, more research grant funds, and more prestige to the lab and to the university,&#8221; said Rebecca DuBois, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of biomolecular engineering, who works with postdoc scholars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalpostdoc.org/page/2021NPAW">National Postdoc Appreciation Week</a>, which runs from Sept. 20&#8211;24, offers universities a time to recognize the critical contributions of postdoctoral scholars.</p>
<p>John Dzimianski, a postdoctoral scholar, began working in the <a href="https://dubois.soe.ucsc.edu">DuBois lab</a> in 2019 doing research to help develop a more effective and longer-lasting flu vaccine. The work was put on pause when the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic hit and the lab switched to working on a serological assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV&#8211;2, the virus that causes COVID&#8211;19.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways, COVID distracted us but in other ways it highlighted new technologies we could put in our pipeline,&#8221; Dzimianski said. &#8220;For example, now instead of just sticking with traditional more established platforms for a flu vaccine, we could use mRNA,&#8221; referring to the new messenger RNA vaccines used to protect against serious illness and hospitalization due to COVID&#8211;19.</p>
<p>At first, Dzimianski said, the hardest thing about being a postdoctoral scholar was jumping into a new research environment and field of work. Now, his biggest challenge is thinking about the next step. &#8220;You have to develop your own ideas and branch out on your own and eventually walk out the door,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When he finishes his postdoc work, he hopes to get a research faculty position at a university and possibly run his own lab.</p>
<p>Simone Olivetti, a postdoctoral scholar in computational modeling at the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu">Institute of Marine Sciences</a>, is working on salmon migration&#8212;combining computational fluid dynamics and artificial intelligence methods. He collaborates with biologists and computer scientists in a multidisciplinary environment.</p>
<p>He joined UC Santa Cruz after years of living in Italy and France in part because he was interested in using artificial intelligence. &#8220;It&#8217;s a growing technology but it must be used for a great purpose, for community interest and development,&#8221; Olivetti said. &#8220;It has a lot of potential if we use it in the right way. It can free people from boring labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olivetti is not sure yet what he will do after he finishes his postdoctoral work. He wants to continue working in research and development but is not sure if we would like to do that in academia or in private companies. He hopes to remain in the United States.</p>
<p>Karen Arcos, a UC President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellow, is researching how people&#8217;s memory and ability to learn are affected when the information is uncertain. &#8220;It&#8217;s really relevant to the times now,&#8221; Arcos said.</p>
<p>She is also submitting two papers to peer-reviewed journals comparing memory between blind and sighted people. She has found that when completing more complex memory tasks like remembering lists of digits in backward order, blind people remember more than sighted people. Blind people also remember more when hearing digits, while sighted people remember more when seeing them.</p>
<p>Her desire for equity provides the inspiration for her areas of study.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strive to make the world more inclusive as someone who is totally blind,&#8221; Arcos said.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t realize how difficult postdoctoral work can be, Arcos said. Postdoctoral scholars have to be diligent in completing their research in a limited time before their fellowship is over. It is also a difficult adjustment to go from student to employee, she said. Postdocs have less access to career services but must figure out a way to compete on the job market.</p>
<p>Arcos is hoping to eventually find a career in communicating science to underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have more diversity in science,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/&#126;bcstorm/people.html">Professor Benjamin Storm</a>, who supervises Arcos in his memory lab, said he appreciates the opportunity to work with postdocs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because postdocs have already finished graduate school, and because they have experience working in other labs, they often come in with skills and perspectives that really help advance your research program in a way that would be difficult to do otherwise,&#8221; Storm said. &#8220;It can be an opportunity to take your work in new and exciting directions.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="04df0675807270466cc00b00a37327ea"><name>move-in-2021</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Move-in 2021: Relief and excitement as students return to campus </title><summary>A campus kept quiet for 18 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic came back to life as students moved in before the start of the fall quarter.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A traditional late-summer heavy marine layer clamped over UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, but nothing could dampen high spirits on the first day of move-in 2021 after a long period of distance learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A campus kept quiet and sparsely populated for 18 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic came back to life. Cars stuffed with belongings lined up alongside grazing cows on Hagar Drive and on the way into the campus's Performing Arts Center area for parking lot check-in spots. At the colleges, yellow moving carts were filled with boxes, bags, suitcases, snacks, blankets, and fringe-covered pillows.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall 2021 move-in runs from Thursday, September 16, through Wednesday, September 22.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is welcoming almost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6,100 new students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the fall 2021 quarter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,150 freshmen and 1,890 transfer students. About 18,600 students will attend UC Santa Cruz this academic year, with 9,300 living in campus housing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of classes&#8212;approximately 68 percent&#8212;will be in-person this fall, with expectations to have even more in-person courses in winter and spring, providing vaccines continue to be effective against COVID-19 variants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus and larger community are thrilled to welcome students back&#8212;the campus has partnered with downtown Santa Cruz organizations to host the first </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/downtown-day-2021.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday, September 24, which will be an afternoon full of fun activities, student performances, free goodies, lots of prizes, and ending the day with a free viewing of the movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one campus personality is perhaps the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVT-Ip7dQyY&amp;t=6s">most fired up of all</a>. Sammy the Slug made an appearance during Thursday's move-in, dancing, posing for photos, helping students roll their moving carts, and spreading joy and good cheer.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fulfilling goals, finding diversity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Romario Linares, a Crown College freshman from Hawthorne whose major is computer science and game design, making some changes is among his priorities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm looking forward to really just changing who I am right now. I have a lot of goals in mind that I want to fulfill here, and just living on my own, too, 'cause my mom is super careful, a motherly mom," Linares said, as his mother, Rachel Linares, sidled up and handed him his coat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming independent is on Rachel Linares's priority list for Romario, as well, even though the step of dropping him off at college is bittersweet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she's looking forward to all the new experiences for Romario, "so meeting different people, going on his career path&#8212;I think he's in an excellent place to get there in computer science," she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her impression from UC Santa Cruz's communication so far was one of care and support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There felt like a great amount of wanting the kids to succeed. The level of support I feel with this school is, you want everybody to be successful," she said. "For me it's like a peace of mind, knowing that."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grady Clark of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Boulder, Colo., a freshman at Merrill College waiting in line below the East Field, expressed relief and excitement at the start of the quarter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was just very hopeful that we'd be in person this year, and it's good to see that it's actually happening," said Clark, an applied linguistics major.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark said he's looking forward to working in the pottery lab in his dorm, meeting cool people, and finding cool spaces.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I guess to meet more queer people as well, be in a more diverse space," he added.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Community and freedom</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaya Cummins had done the eight-hour drive from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">North County San Diego the day before. The Crown freshman, a molecular, cellular and developmental biology major, was nervous but excited.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I've never been to Northern California, so it's going to be an awesome experience," she said. "I'm really looking forward to finding a good group of people to surround myself with and finding a sense of community. And I'm really excited to explore life up here and the town and the campus."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummins's stepfather, Jason Poole, was waiting nearby in the parking lot.</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Cummins is already pretty independent, but he's looking forward to seeing her grow and gain confidence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Dalya Salih of Fremont, a Crown College freshman majoring in biomolecular engineering and bioinformatics, the leap to college is a big change, but the distance from home is just right.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don't live too far, so I can go visit, I can see my siblings, but I can also have my freedom here. It's a good ratio," she said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>'Nice to finally be here'</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying overflowing baskets and stuffed animals, friends Shireen Sabouri and Maria Movsesyan, both of San Jose, were moving into Parkman House in Cowell College.</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabouri is a sophomore majoring in politics, but she'd never been on campus because of pandemic distance learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I honestly enjoyed the academic sense of distance learning and being at my own pace with most things, but I definitely missed the social aspect of the freshman year experience," she said. "It'll be nice to finally be here."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movsesyan, a freshman with a proposed major of biochemistry, agreed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm really excited to be here," she said. "It's long overdue."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parent Rob Judin of San Ramon was waiting outside Parkman House as his son, freshman Jeremy Judin, unpacked in his dorm room.</span></p>

<p>Dear Campus Community,&#160;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so exciting to see our campus buzzing with activity after a successful move-in. Everyone in our campus community worked so hard to get us to this point and should take a moment to celebrate this milestone.</p>
<p>Each week, we will provide the campus with helpful updates and summaries of the measures underway to support the health and well-being of our UC Santa Cruz community.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The great news is that we have not had any positive COVID-19 tests from students who moved into campus housing this past week and weekend.</strong> Every student moving into campus housing was required to come to campus with a COVID-19 test and to again get tested as they moved into campus housing. Students will again need to be tested by Sept. 30.&#160;</p>
<h2>Summary of Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Status update on campus and in Santa Cruz County</li>
<li aria-level="1">Free, easy asymptomatic COVID-19 tests available&#160;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Status Update</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No positive COVID-19 tests among residential students:</strong> As mentioned above, no students who moved into campus housing have tested positive for COVID-19.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>No students in campus quarantine/isolation:</strong> Our dashboard shows 16 students in quarantine and 76 students in isolation. These are students residing off-campus in isolation; none are in the campus quarantine and isolation space. Some students tested positive as they were preparing to come to campus and will remain at their permanent residence until they&#8217;re no longer contagious.</li>
<li><strong>High vaccination rate in our campus community:</strong> As of today, 91 percent of UC Santa Cruz students and 91 percent of employees have complied with our COVID vaccine policy.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Slug Strong dashboard offers regular updates:</strong> Our <a href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/">COVID-19 dashboard is updated daily</a> and provides a breakdown of COVID-19 cases.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome.aspx">Santa Cruz County dashboard</a> shows decline in new cases:</strong> The county currently has 509 active known cases, which is a 34 percent decline over the past 14 days.</li>
<li><strong>Mask up!</strong> Both the campus and county require face coverings in most indoor situations.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asymptomatic Testing Program</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz continues to provide free and easy asymptomatic COVID-19 testing for our campus community.&#160;</p>
<p>Vaccinated students living on campus must get a COVID-19 test within five to seven days of moving to UC Santa Cruz. Vaccinated students who live off campus must get a test by Sept. 30. Unvaccinated students with approved exemptions must continue to be tested at least once every four days throughout the quarter, commencing with their arrival on campus.</p>
<p>Testing is voluntary for vaccinated employees who live, work or come on-site for any reason. Unvaccinated staff and faculty with approved exemptions who come on-site for any reason are also required to test at least every four days.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s campus update provided a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/testing-requirements.html">summary about how and when to get tested.</a> There are many options available.</p>

She will continue working at UC Santa Cruz through the end of fall quarter, starting at Brown on Jan. 1, 2022.</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate Sarah&#8217;s willingness to continue serving our campus as we resume more in-person activities. For nearly a decade, she has provided invaluable leadership to our campus. In addition to helping lead UCSC through emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 wildfires, Latham has effectively managed the largest division on campus, which includes everything from Staff Human Resources to Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services.</p>
<p>Partnering with colleagues within the division, across campus, and across the UC system, her accomplishments are many. The Division of Business and Administrative Services during her tenure developed a culture of stewardship, simplification and process optimization, which was advanced through Sarah&#8217;s creation of the BAS Simplification and Innovation STAR award program. The division has recognized hundreds of staff members who have developed ways to save the campus money and time, and to enhance service. Sarah and her team have helped launch new programs that provide support for faculty, staff, and students with families, including the new back-up child care program.</p>
<p>Sarah has also been an active member in our community, helping advance our campus connections with city and county leaders, serving for two years as co-chair of the annual Second Harvest Food Bank Holiday Food Drive and as president of the Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Clearly, Brown recognizes Sarah&#8217;s vision, leadership, and extensive accomplishments at UC Santa Cruz. As the senior member of Brown&#8217;s executive team responsible for most non-academic operations, she will lead all administrative, business and financial operations.</p>
<p>I will share interim plans for divisional leadership later this quarter. In the meantime, please join me in thanking Sarah for her service to UC Santa Cruz, and congratulating her as she begins this new chapter in her career.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="09656661807270466cc00b001a1d602c"><name>lrdp-notice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz releases final Environmental Impact Report for LRDP</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has released the Final Environmental Impact Report that supports the proposed 2021 Long Range Development Plan.&#13;

The proposed revisions address the following key<br/>issues:</p>
<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Green Building Design: The updates to this policy section align with industry practice by providing<br/>an option for building design teams to further customize their use of energy efficiency performance<br/>targets for laboratory buildings. The updates also specify a reporting procedure for the existing policy<br/>requirement for energy-efficient new buildings.</p>
<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Climate Protection: First, this policy section is revised to add criteria addressing concerns around<br/>the quality of potential carbon offsets that locations may purchase to meet greenhouse gas emissions<br/>reduction goals. Historically, no constraints have been in place for the purchase of offsets. Second,<br/>consistent with the expanded, more comprehensive, and inclusive mission of the Carbon Neutrality<br/>Initiative and in response to input from many faculty and students, campus climate action plans that<br/>have previously focused exclusively on emissions reductions will be required to also integrate<br/>environmental justice, adaptation, and resilience. Third, in response to some confusion regarding<br/>whether the policy would allow locations to increase greenhouse gas emissions after meeting the 2020<br/>emissions target, the revisions clarify that greenhouse gas emissions reductions should be maintained<br/>after the 2020 target date.</p>
<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Sustainable Transportation: Technological advances in zero-emission vehicles and new State policy<br/>goals for zero-emission vehicles led to a need and opportunity to update the fleet goals in this policy<br/>section. Secondly, changes in work and commuting patterns during the pandemic created an opportunity<br/>and need for campus sustainable transportation programs to promote telecommuting opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Sustainable Water Systems: Updated the section to make it easier to read and removed expired<br/>dates and details that are already regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Sustainability at UC Health: Some health locations had not yet adopted waste and water reduction<br/>goals. All health locations will now have the same waste and water reduction goals.<br/>The policy is available to<a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/uc_sustainable_practices_2021.pdf"> view online.</a></p>

<p>PCAST is the sole body of external advisors charged with making science, technology, and innovation policy recommendations to the President and the White House.</p>
<p>Drawing from the nation&#8217;s most talented and accomplished individuals, President Biden&#8217;s PCAST includes 20 elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, five MacArthur &#8220;Genius&#8221; Fellows, two former Cabinet secretaries, and two Nobel laureates. Its members represent the most diverse PCAST in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Sullivan graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in Earth sciences. A geologist, former NASA astronaut, and oceanographer, she served as Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Sullivan flew on three Space Shuttle missions, including the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. She was the first American woman to walk in space, the first woman to dive to the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench (the deepest part of the Earth&#8217;s oceans), and is the first and only person to do both.

<p><span>Comprised of 12 public events, the festival is designed to be a place where artists can share their work, celebrate their identities, and learn about their communities in a safe and public place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of dance Gerald Casel is helping to co-produce the event, along with his own dance company. He explained how the festival came about.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It is a collaboration between my company, Gerald Casel Dance, Motion Pacific, and Tannery World Dance and Cultural Center&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;We wanted to create a space where Black, Brown, and Queer people were centered, affirmed, and celebrated.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It is also a response to Santa Cruz County&#8217;s resolution that racism is a public health crisis,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Instead of fighting over resources, these three dance organizations are building a coalition of inclusion and belonging so that QTBIPOC people feel safe and seen in this town.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Casel noted that the festival will be a mix of performances, workshops, discussions, and outdoor events that highlight the vibrancy of dance artists in Santa Cruz, as well as from the Bay Area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It also offers community-engagement in the form of public gatherings that address issues of racism that BIPOC folks experience while living here,&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;The festival is for all people, but there will be a few workshops dedicated to cultural affinity groups&#8212;an all-BIPOC workshop led by Melissa Wiley/Vyxen Monroe, and a white affinity group discussing white allyship and support,&#8221; he added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Casel&#8217;s dance company </span><span>is scheduled to perform</span><span> on Sunday, October 3, at 2 p.m., outside on Pacific Avenue in downtown Santa Cruz. He said he will be creating and performing a ritual/procession/dance featuring an all-BIPOC cast with live sound design by Roco Cordova.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Casel will also be teaching a movement workshop and facilitating &#8220;Dancing Around Race&#8221;&#8212;a community-engaged participatory process that creates an opportunity for people from various dance/art/performance communities to discuss issues around systemic racism, power, and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Participants will be invited to join in a candid conversation that acknowledges and challenges the role race plays in dance performance, production, and education,&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;W</span><span>e ask: What does it look/feel like to have racial equity in dance? How can we collectively confront racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, white body supremacy, and settler colonial logics in dance? What does the future look like and how do we get there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Other highlights of the festival include a performance by </span><span>Gregory Dawson&#8217;s company on Friday night, as well as a burlesque show and dance party on Saturday night led by Vyxen Monroe. Performers from ballet, folklorico, and post/modern dance will all be featured. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">"We want to lift up our communities of color and center healing and joy, so expect lots of dancing on and off stage and in the streets," said Casel.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;All of the workshops look amazing and the best part is that all events will be free of charge, thanks to a grant that we received from the California Arts Council&#8217;s Impact Projects, as well as Santa Cruz County and many community sponsors," he added.&#160;</span></p>

Beginning in October, guests will once again be welcomed back inside to visit the center&#8217;s interactive exhibits, touch live sharks, and enjoy a brand new display featuring stunning photographs of marine life taken by UC Santa Cruz scientists in the field.</p>
<p>The new exhibit, entitled &#8220;Photos from the Field: Through the Eyes of our Scientists,&#8221; reflects a focus on cutting-edge scientific research and how it shapes ocean and coastal conservation efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;One important story the exhibit tells is about how interconnected our different ecosystems are,&#8221; says Eric Palkovacs, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and one of the scientists who contributed to the exhibit. &#8220;In these photos you will see how headwater streams and rivers, estuaries, rocky shores, coastal redwood forests, and kelp forests are all connected, and their future is intertwined.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Plan your visit</h2>
<p>The Seymour Center will open for two members-only preview weekends October 1&#8211;3 and October 8&#8211;10 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Fans of the Seymour Center who are not yet members and would like to attend the opening weekend can <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=1167&amp;cid=2357">sign up for or renew membership online</a>. Basic annual membership prices range from $25 for an individual student to $70 for a family, with additional benefits available for higher levels of membership.</p>
<p>After the preview weekends, the center will reopen to the general public every Friday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., beginning October 15. Tickets can be purchased at the door. Information to plan your visit is available on the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/hours-admission/">Seymour Center web site</a>.</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes tours of the marine mammal pools are currently unavailable, but visitors will be able to enjoy all other indoor attractions and the popular outdoor education stations at the famous blue whale and gray whale skeletons.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hicken, the new director of the Seymour Center, says he is excited to be welcoming people back to explore their oceans.</p>
<p>"The human world may have shut down, but the oceans didn't. Neither did the world-class marine scientists who live and work in our community,&#8221; says Hicken. &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait for the Seymour Center&#8217;s halls to be filled with curiosity and discovery as you and your family experience the ocean through the eyes of a scientist. Welcome back!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Health and safety</h2>
<p>To ensure the safety of all guests, visitors to the Seymour Center must pass a <a href="https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_24vMSiDcxZp6VRX">symptom check</a> before entering the building.

A request to take the survey will be sent to all frosh and new transfer students through<span class="gmail_default"> the Office of Institutional Research, Assessment and Policy Studies. </span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The triage survey is part of a module pilot program from FoolProof, a nonprofit financial education platform. SlugCents already partners with FoolProof to provide online financial literacy modules for students. This new pilot program is a longitudinal pilot consisting of two surveys over two years.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first triage survey, launching on October 5th, identifies students at risk of withdrawing from school due to finances. Students who report financial pressures on the survey will receive automated FoolProof module recommendations based on their survey responses. Modules recommended include credit cards, fraud, renting, and money habits.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A second triage survey will launch in the second year of the pilot program. The students that participated in the first survey will take a second identical survey. Students will take this second survey at the end of their second year at UCSC. The data from the second survey will be compared to the data from the first to measure SlugCents&#8217; effectiveness and the program&#8217;s connection to persistence and retention rates.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Financial pressure is the number one reason students leave school before completing their degree, according to the Center for Public Education. Financial pressures include lack of financial support, uncertainty surrounding the cost of education and financial aid, inability to take on loans, and more.&#160;</span></p>

We&#8217;re excited to have returned to primarily in-person instruction for the first time since March 2020, when campus shifted to remote learning and work at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collectively adapted during the ensuing 18 months, but having a full cohort of students living on campus again, faculty and students back in classrooms, and staff keeping the whole operation humming is a reminder of the power of a community united in purpose.</p>
<p>Campus operations might look a bit different now than years past, but our teaching, research and public service mission continues. We have <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/hsi-programs.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIqZNnKd8wuLiTYIcSYt83RrXQkg" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/hsi-programs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched an array of new programs</a> to support the success of our students and to prepare them for rewarding careers once they graduate. Campus scientists have been chosen to lead a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/pathogen-genomics.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsFIEApFpAlZfCopIo3X6KNHMVlA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/pathogen-genomics.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new state public-health program</a> that will galvanize pandemic-related genomic data analysis while showcasing our research excellence. And our effort to launch a campus diagnostic lab in the early days of the pandemic, in part to help the most vulnerable residents of our county, resulted just this past weekend in the campus receiving the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/phil-rather-award.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiHDic4f23MCetGKcEkpQ_NDcM7g" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/phil-rather-award.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 Phil Rather Award for Leadership in Healthcare</a> from the Community Health Trust of Pajaro Valley. We could not be more proud.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to UC Santa Cruz or spent the past year learning or working remotely, take the time to get reacquainted with our spectacular campus and all it has to offer. Visit the state parks and city open spaces that abut our campus, and be sure to take a trip to the coast. And definitely get to know Santa Cruz and its fantastic restaurants and shops. A good way to do that would be to check out the first-ever <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/downtown-day-2021.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFMsyUApBiYCWq0bbWR9OfEh6zRQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/downtown-day-2021.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Downtown Day</a> set for Friday. We&#8217;ve partnered with the Downtown Association on the event to give those new to our campus community a look at the vibrant city scene.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to learn about or reacquaint yourself with our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFL_5Y5hWdk7U4r9r6WOLTOCkayVA" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a>. We are committed to promoting and protecting an environment that values and supports every person in an atmosphere of respect, honesty, cooperation, professionalism and fairness. It&#8217;s at the heart of who we are at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The University of California policy mandating COVID vaccination for all students and employees is the foundation of our return. As of today, 99 percent of students living on campus this fall have complied, while 91 percent of our total student population has done so. Our faculty and staff compliance rate is equally strong, also at 91 percent. Having a fully vaccinated campus is vital to the well-being of our community, and we are grateful for your attentiveness, unity of purpose, and for your consideration for your fellow Slugs.</p>
<p>What we saw during move-in was heartening. We did not have a single student moving into campus housing test positive for COVID-19. Our county and state COVID numbers are also trending in the right direction. COVID cases and hospitalizations are on the decline in Santa Cruz County, and California has the lowest coronavirus case rate in the nation. But If we have learned anything over the course of this pandemic, it is that this virus is unpredictable. We will likely have some breakthrough cases, but our goal is to minimize those. We will not hesitate to modify our plans and operations if that is what the science and/or public health guidance requires. We will continue to prioritize your health and well-being.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we keep the positive momentum we have built. Please visit our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632513807719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6AlKnaWtPsdjDFPNIDPTQz5tF6g" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Strong website</a> for requirements and recommendations on keeping our community safe. In short, always wear a face covering when accessing shared indoor spaces on campus, regardless of vaccination status; perform a daily symptom check when heading to any campus locations; stay home if you are sick; and follow our asymptomatic testing protocol.</p>
<p>This academic year holds great promise. We have an opportunity to take the best of what we have learned over the past year and a half of remote learning and to apply it to in-person instruction.

While other Californians tan at the beach, hold BBQs, or relax at the pool, he makes a beeline for the high country. Striding across snowfields and rock scree atop eastern California&#8217;s highest ranges, this UC Santa Cruz graduate student seeks to understand why a sparrow-sized mountain bird is riding the &#8220;escalator to extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As climate change accelerates, species are moving toward the poles or up in elevation. I&#8217;m interested in species already using habitats at the highest elevations; they have no place to go,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>Of all North America&#8217;s birds, the gray-crowned rosy finch best epitomizes the escalator predicament. Sporting gray and black head plumage over a cinnamon body shot through with raspberry pink, this stocky finch breeds at higher elevations than any other North American bird. In California, the birds are found only along the spines of the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains. Already located at the southern edge of their range, these are the rosy finches most at risk of running out of habitat.</p>
<p>&#8220;People ask, can&#8217;t these birds fly to another mountain? But that&#8217;s not how it works. The Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains are really isolated,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>In many ways, Brown&#8217;s path to studying finches is a prime example of the myriad ways the UC Natural Reserve System prepares enterprising young people to pursue the natural sciences. Having encountered the NRS first as a student and then as staff, Brown is now conducting his graduate research with both financial help from and field station accommodations in the reserve system. He now pays what he&#8217;s learned forward by serving as a mentor to his undergraduate field assistants, who are using what they&#8217;ve learned to launch their own careers in conservation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got inspired to do ecology from the reserves,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<h2>Bitten by field research</h2>
<p>Brown&#8217;s route to field research began as a student at Cabrillo Community College in Santa Cruz County. In one of his first classes, he visited the NRS&#8217;s Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were learning outside. I had not ever experienced anything like that,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>He was so taken by the visit that, after transferring to UC Santa Cruz, Brown made sure half his classes consisted of field courses. These included the Natural History Field Quarter and the Supercourse, both of which took him to even more NRS reserves. By graduation, he says, &#8220;I realized field science was what I wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown landed a job as a part-time field technician at the NRS&#8217;s Younger Lagoon Reserve in Santa Cruz in 2012. That led to a six-year stint on staff, during which he was named reserve steward, then field manager overseeing habitat restoration.</p>
<p>&#8220;What reserves did for me was take this academic book knowledge I had and give me a way to apply it,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>As field manager, Brown worked with students to return native vegetation to the reserve&#8217;s former brussels sprouts fields. He and reserve director Elizabeth Howard expanded the program to both hasten restoration and provide learning opportunities to more undergraduates, taking on up to 20 student interns per quarter. Brown oversaw intern duties, which ranged from collecting seeds from wild plants, growing starts in greenhouses, outplanting on reserve lands, and monitoring plant growth. In addition, he helped students conduct research on restoration methods and publish the results.</p>
<h2>Bird banding<strong><br/></strong></h2>
<p>By 2017, Brown was helping to develop and run a bird banding internship at Younger Lagoon. &#8220;I just wanted to do more. The reserve system was a platform where I was growing in ecology and wanting to do research,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Reserve director Howard and UCSC NRS Administrative Director Gage Dayton had wanted to expose students to bird banding, a critical ornithology skill. They turned to help from expert bird banders Breck Tyler, who still holds the master banding permit for the reserve, and Martha Brown. The two had initiated a banding program at the reserve in the 1970s. The pair agreed to train reserve staff, including field manager Tim Brown and the reserve&#8217;s interns. The program continues to equip students with skills that can help them qualify for field science jobs after graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of students are interested in ornithology, but there are not a lot of opportunities in school to handle birds. And it&#8217;s hard to get jobs without experience,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>The reserve&#8217;s bird banding station has continued to operate and train students under the direction of Howard and current restoration field manager Vaughan Williams.</p>
<h2>Prime opportunity<strong><br/></strong></h2>
<p>A year later, Brown encountered a prime opportunity to boost his ecology career to the next level. UC Santa Cruz Professor Erika Zavaleta announced she had funding for a student to research songbirds in the Sierra Nevada while mentoring undergraduates as field assistants. Zavaleta leads two programs encouraging students from backgrounds underrepresented in the field sciences to enter careers in ecology and conservation: the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a>, and the Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-based Opportunities (<a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/">CAMINO</a>). Brown had gotten to know Zavaleta while working with students from both programs at Younger Lagoon.</p>
<p>The position in Zavaleta&#8217;s lab, Brown realized, couldn&#8217;t be more perfect for him if he&#8217;d written it himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had gotten permitted to band birds, and was already a climber interested in the mountains. I had also mentored hundreds of students at that point,&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p>By the time Brown heard about the opportunity, he had a scant two weeks to assemble his graduate school application, including letters of recommendation. Here again, his years of work with the NRS came through. &#8220;Luckily I had established a relationship with faculty while with the reserves; people knew what I could do,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>Rosy finch country</h2>
<p>Brown began graduate school in summer of 2018. For his dissertation research, he opted to document the basic life history of eastern California&#8217;s rosy finches, <em>Leucosticte tephrocotis dawsoni</em>. Little is known about the habits and needs of this alpine specialist. Brown is figuring out whether birds hailing from the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains interbreed, why they nest only on mountaintops, and how a declining snowpack might affect their ability to survive in a warming world.</p>
<p>To gather the data he needs, Brown leads a team of undergraduate field assistants into the backcountry for 10 weeks from June to August. The group piles everything they will need, from sleeping bags to sunscreen, and food to field equipment, into a rented SUV, and drives to a mountain trailhead. Everyone then straps on a backpack laden with 50 pounds or more, and treks up to 20 miles to base camp at locations roughly two miles above sea level.</p>
<p>Research days are no less grueling. The team tromps over talus slopes, skirts alpine ridges and marches through snowfields to set out straight line transects and sample the vegetation, note the terrain, and generally characterize the finches&#8217; environment. They spend hours squinting through binoculars to count the finches, observing their eating habits, and collecting samples of finch food.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a certain kind of person to be able to do what we&#8217;re doing all summer long,&#8221; Brown says drily.</p>
<h2>Insects on ice</h2>
<p>Brown&#8217;s finch observations appear to affirm the central role of snow in finch survival. The chilly white stuff, he says, &#8220;serves as a giant sticky trap for insects blowing up from lower elevations. They&#8217;re feeding directly off this nutrient source from a different location,&#8221; Brown says.</p>
<p>In addition to snow-stunned insects, rosy finches also eat seeds. In an environment with few plants, insects from the Owens Valley might be what helps the finches successfully reproduce. To this end, Brown is investigating how these birds may be shifting their diet as the snow melts and their chicks continue to require nutrient-rich food. This information will help reveal how reliant the birds are on summer snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like snowpack is underlying all the questions I have,&#8221; Brown says. &#8220;Most of us in California are reliant on water in snowpack; it&#8217;s an attribute that is of direct importance to society.&#8221;</p>
<p>On other days, the researchers trap birds to gather body measurements and obtain blood and feather samples. Brown will perform genetic analyses on some samples, to develop population information, and isotope analyses on others, which will show how much of the birds&#8217; diet originates from lowland areas and is blown to high elevations versus foodstuffs from the mountains themselves.</p>
<h2>Student assistants<strong><br/></strong></h2>
<p>Student assistants play a central role in Brown&#8217;s field campaigns. To recruit them, Brown makes presentations about his research to both the Doris Duke and CAMINO programs. Those interested can apply for one of Brown&#8217;s four summer positions.</p>
<p>Brown is careful to describe the demands and privations of finch research. These include learning a long list of bird calls to identify species by sound, the need to work as a team, and what it&#8217;s like to live for many days at a stretch in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I interview them I tell them to expect Type 1 fun and Type 2 fun,&#8221; Brown says. Type 1 is the usual kind: enjoying yourself in the moment. &#8220;Type 2 is when you&#8217;re not having fun when doing it, but you have a story to tell when you get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keeping everyone safe and coordinated is no mean feat in such challenging conditions. For this reason, Brown says, &#8220;the mentoring I did at Younger as a staff member has been invaluable. There&#8217;s much facilitating and work to set someone up for success with a meaningful outcome for both you and the student.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Keeping up with Brown</h2>
<p>Even so, his undergraduate helpers aren&#8217;t always prepared for the intensity of the experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a mountain main,&#8221; says Juan Rebellon, a Doris Duke program participant who served as a field assistant for Brown in 2018. &#8220;He can run up mountains and would usually set the pace. Most of us are just used to sea level, so we would be suffering on most of the hikes up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s assistants have even established a document filled with advice for future assistants. Many comment that they wish they had been more fit before starting the summer.</p>
<p>Between multi-day stints in the field, everyone stays for a couple of days at NRS reserves. Staying at the NRS&#8217;s White Mountain Research Center, Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory, or Valentine Camp enables students to grab a hot shower, do laundry, and spend a little time in town. A 2019&#8211;20 Mildred E. Mathias Graduate Student Research Grant from the UC Natural Reserve System has helped Brown cover the cost of reserve accommodations for his team.</p>
<p>In spite&#8212;or maybe because&#8212;of the tough conditions, Brown&#8217;s student helpers say the summer they spent with Brown has proved pivotal to their careers.</p>
<p>CAMINO student Sarah Albright met Brown while banding birds with him at Younger Lagoon. Even though she had taken multiple field courses as a UC Santa Cruz undergraduate, Albright credits her 2019 summer experience with Brown as forging her current professional path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim&#8217;s a great mentor in the outdoors,&#8221; Albright says. &#8220;He&#8217;s kind, and he&#8217;s a really good teacher, and he&#8217;ll cut you slack at the right time, but he pushes his interns in a really meaningful way. That helps them become better ecologists and better people to do work in the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown himself notices students gradually growing more comfortable with the wilderness over the course of the summer. The transition is particularly striking because most of his interns did not grow up either camping or hiking. &#8220;At first they&#8217;re like oh, we&#8217;ll sleep inside the tent, with the fly on. They can&#8217;t imagine sleeping outside. As we move on in the summer, they take pride in becoming dirtbags. They&#8217;ll say, we&#8217;re good, we&#8217;ll just sleep on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown even introduced Albright to her current employer, another rosy finch researcher working in Colorado. &#8220;I&#8217;m thankful every day because without that internship, it would have been hard to get jobs after school in field work,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m now on my fourth season, and it all comes back to the rosy finch research I worked on with Tim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karim Hanna, a Doris Duke program alumnus who worked for Brown in 2018, has a similar tale to tell. &#8220;That summer experience I had with Tim was one of the biggest experiences I had in my undergraduate years. Tim helped shape the way I wanted to pursue a career,&#8221; says Hanna.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Stony Brook University, Hanna has led conservation crews in Utah, and is now monitoring seabirds in Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday it was raining on us and we had to hike probably a mile through mud. But after hiking up massive mountains with Tim, I know that I have the physical and mental capacities to perform hard physical tasks. That summer gave me a mentality of being able to maintain positivity in those harsh settings. That was the biggest thing: learning from him that the way you perceive the experience will change it for you.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Environmental careers</h2>
<p>Rebellon has just completed his first year of graduate school in coastal environmental management at Duke University. When the going gets tough, he says, &#8220;I still lean on that field experience to keep me going. Whenever I&#8217;m in finals, I say to myself, you know, this is easier than tracking down those finches in the Sierra.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hanna and Albright too plan to head to graduate school after gaining a little more field experience. &#8220;Not everybody can work unpaid internships while in school. But doing your bachelor&#8217;s isn&#8217;t enough anymore; people want that experience. So positions like Tim&#8217;s and programs like CAMINO play wonderful, wonderful roles in opening up opportunities for students and bridging gaps, because it allows students to get really awesome field experience that leads to jobs in a way that they can support themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown himself expects to finish graduate school in 2023. After that, he wants to apply his scientific skills to protect the environment. &#8220;I would like to have a career with a direct impact on students, and bring science to the public. I could see myself doing something with a similar type of mission as the NRS, to promote integrated research and teaching.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="18611714807270466cc00b000f4722f5"><name>excelencia-action-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz joins Excelencia in Action Network to help advance Latinx student success</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has joined the Excelencia in Action Network.</summary><start-date>1632466800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz joins Excelencia in Action Network to help advance Latinx student success</display-name><path>/2021/09/excelencia-action-network</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/excelencia-action-network</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1632496588546</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632496588546</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has joined the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia in Action Network.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The need to create programs that empower our students is not unique to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;In my conversations&#160; with college and university leaders nationwide, I find that we are united on student success. By coming together, we can promote best practices, amplify our voices at the national level, and ensure that our concerns are addressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leadership group includes more than 100 chancellors and presidents representing more than 150 institutions of higher education in 22 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, enrolling roughly one-quarter of all Latinx students nationwide. Roughly 90 percent of the member institutions are public. Four other University of California campuses are members: Davis, Merced, Riverside, and San Diego.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Execlencia encourages practitioners to take an evidence-based approach to evaluating the impact and effectiveness of programs, practices, and policies aimed to accelerate Latinx student success,&#8221; said Charis Herzon, UCSC director of HSI Initiatives. &#8220;Additionally, Excelencia helps us build partnerships, networks, and community as leaders by sharing and highlighting what is working. Chancellor Larive joining this network both empowers and encourages our leadership at all levels in our push for racial equity in education.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a23b97a807270466cc00b00b4002613"><name>crossing-latinidades-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mellon Foundation grant will support national initiative in Latinx studies</title><summary>Through a three-year, $5 million grant from The Andrew W.

Mellon Foundation, UC Santa Cruz will be part of a national initiative in Latinx studies called &#8220;Crossing Latinidades: Emerging Scholars and New Comparative Directions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) will lead this grant project as part of a consortium of 16 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) that have R1 designation&#8212;for top-tier doctoral universities with very high research activity&#8212;from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. That group includes UC Santa Cruz. Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Associate Professor and former Chair of Latin American &amp; Latino Studies Gabriela Arredondo have been involved with planning efforts since 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key component of the new grant project will be the creation of an intensive yearly summer institute on Latinx studies methodologies and theories and a mentorship program that aims to enhance rising scholars&#8217; comparative research skills, intellectual curiosity, creativity and critical thinking. Each university will send two pre-proposal graduate students to the summer institute, and 96 students in total will benefit from the institute and from an assigned mentor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second part of the program is a research working group initiative that seeks to impact the field of Latinx studies with a new model of collaborative, comparative and cross-regional research to more accurately reflect the changing configurations of Latinx people in the United States. In years two and three of the grant, 10 research working groups will be funded that will include senior and junior Latinx studies scholars as well as six graduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for the current grant award also include the creation of a web portal that will network all faculty conducting research in Latinx studies at the consortium&#8217;s universities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Beyond the financial support that the programs within this grant will offer, this prestigious award amplifies the importance of Latinx studies and Latinx scholars in these fields and disciplines,&#8221; said UCSC Associate Professor Gabriela Arredondo. &#8220;I am excited about these new opportunities to collaborate with scholars and scholars-in-training in Latinx studies across institutions, and I am excited about the support expressed by Chancellors and Presidents in this consortium for Latinx humanistic studies.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olga Herrera, a visiting scholar in Latin American and Latino studies at UIC, will serve as the director of the Crossing Latinidades initiative. Catherine Ram&#237;rez, professor and current chair of UCSC&#8217;s Latin American &amp; Latino Studies Department, will help to lead implementation of the grant at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the goal of the consortium of 16 R1-HSI universities is to increase the number of Latinx students pursuing terminal degrees and advancing to academic positions. This grant project is the first initiative the group will undertake, but additional plans are currently being developed across all fields of studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with UC Santa Cruz and UIC, the institutional partners in the consortium are the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York; University of Arizona; University of California, Irvine; University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; Florida International University; University of Central Florida; University of New Mexico; University of Nevada, Las Vegas; University of North Texas; Texas Tech University; University of Houston; University of Texas, Arlington, and University of Texas, El Paso.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a4d4a95807270466cc00b00f8850cd6"><name>in-memoriam-david-kaun</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: David Kaun</title><summary>Professor Emeritus of Economics David Kaun, a pioneer faculty member, passed away on Sept. 9.

Photo: UCSC Special Collections &amp; Archives</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Emeritus of Economics David Kaun, a pioneer member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty, passed away on Sept. 9 at the age of 88. He served in the Economics Department for about 50 years and remained involved in the campus community even after his retirement. He was also a generous donor to many causes, including student scholarships at UC Santa Cruz and music and art initiatives on campus and in the broader community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaun earned his doctorate in economics from Stanford University in 1963 and was affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh and the Brookings Institution before he came to UC Santa Cruz in 1966. He was a founding faculty member in economics, and in a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/rev-spring-15-original-vision-march.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he recalled the experiences of those early days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I got here initially, in February of 1966, the physical buildings of Cowell and Stevenson&#8212; respectively, the first and second colleges constructed on campus&#8212;did not exist,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;It was exciting. There were 600 students, and we added another 600 with Stevenson. I had an intro course on economics, and we had four students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economics department then grew to become one of the largest and most popular academic programs on campus. Kaun taught a wide variety of courses for the department over the years, from undergraduate introductory classes and labor economics to innovative courses he designed at the intersection of economics and the arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such class was Economics of the Arts, offered through Kresge College, which was inspired by Kaun&#8217;s love for music, including his experiences as a symphony clarinetist for more than 25 years. Each quarter, the course featured performing artists as guest speakers. Another class, called Labor Wars in Theory and Film, delved into the movie industry. In a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/pioneer-faculty-still-at-work.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kaun reflected on his teaching experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been extremely fortunate, blessed, and lucky to wind up doing something that has been such a joy and pleasure,&#8221; he shared at the time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Kaun&#8217;s former students, UCSC Professor Emeritus of Economics Michael Hutchison, said Kaun was known for challenging his students in order to promote their intellectual growth. And Kaun was a fixture at Stevenson College, where he would eventually serve as provost from 1981 to 1985.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an undergraduate, I loved David&#8217;s classes, and I went on to serve as a TA for him,&#8221; Hutchison recalled. &#8220;These were the days when dogs and smoking were allowed on campus, and David was a frequent sight around Stevenson College with his hound dog Greta, smoking a pipe and sporting a jaunty Irish cap.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another of Kaun&#8217;s former students and TAs, Steve Owen&#8212;who went on to a successful career in international business&#8212;says Kaun&#8217;s teaching ultimately inspired him to come back to the UCSC Economics Department as a lecturer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Experiencing David&#8217;s passion for teaching first-hand made him a role model for me, and I try to be as inspirational for my students as he was to me,&#8221; Owen said. &#8220;Seeing him in action in the classroom and working with him as an undergraduate TA inspired me to want to give back later in my career, so I can truly thank David for putting me on this teaching journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time as provost of Stevenson College, Kaun also created the Stevenson Fellows program, which brought inspiring public figures like George McGovern, Bella Abzug, and Carole King to campus in order to enhance the student experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the classroom, Kaun&#8217;s research interests spanned from the labor market to the military defense industry to the effect of conservative &#8220;think tanks&#8221; on public policy. He was also a strong advocate against nuclear weapons. Art and culture was another of his great passions, and it was also a major focus of his philanthropy. Kaun was a very active donor, supporting health and well-being initiatives and the arts, both in the Santa Cruz community and within the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was as much a musician as he was a professor, and he really believed in philanthropy,&#8221; said Sarah Kudela, director of development for the Arts Division. &#8220;The main areas of philanthropy that he focused on were arts, youth, and underserved populations, and ideally he looked for projects that touched on two or more of those priorities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Kaun&#8217;s many gifts to UC Santa Cruz, he established the </span><a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/giving/endowments/sara-and-albert-kaun-chamber-music-endowment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albert and Sara Kaun Chamber Music Endowment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University Library. He funded composer sponsorships for the Shakespeare Santa Cruz Festival and Holiday Show and underwrote the classical music program for the Arts &amp; Lectures series. Kaun was also instrumental in supporting the </span><a href="https://www.cadrc.org/aatat.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Theater Arts Troupe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cadrc.org/rainbow-theater.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainbow Theater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And he helped to fund the </span><a href="https://music.ucsc.edu/ensembles/wind-ensemble"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Wind Ensemble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kaun also provided scholarship funds for the </span><a href="https://music.ucsc.edu/ensembles/resident-string-quartet-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resident String Ensemble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the David E. Kaun Music Scholarship Endowment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these efforts, he contributed matching funds to the endowment of the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also established the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/milam-mcginty-kaun/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award for Teaching Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers $1,000 each year to two outstanding graduate students. In a prior </span><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-donor/David-Kaun"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profile article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Arts Division, Kaun reflected on his philanthropy at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve helped some students, which is really a great pleasure,&#8221; he said at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaun&#8217;s legacy at the university will continue to support access and achievement in arts and academics for many years to come. And those who knew him will remember him fondly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;David was a fantastic colleague and friend to many of us,&#8221; said Economics Department Chair Alan Spearot. &#8220;Personally, I feel fortunate to have known David, as both an academic and musician, and his presence and contributions to our community will be sorely missed.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="28055952807270466cc00b00b8ebcdce"><name>live-cell-genomics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NIH funds Center for Live Cell Genomics at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>The NIH Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science program has awarded $13.5 million over five years for a new center to advance genomics in biomedical research.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Holger Schmidt, Sofie Salama, Mircea Teodorescu</keywords><start-date>1632726000000</start-date><display-name>NIH funds Center for Live Cell Genomics at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2021/09/live-cell-genomics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/live-cell-genomics</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1632759011645</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632760385283</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/genomics-institute-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/genomics-institute-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>genomics-institute-400.jpg</name><display-name>genomics-institute-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>83692</file-size><width>400</width><height>291</height></image><image-alt>Genomics Institute logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/david-haussler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/david-haussler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16816</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>David Haussler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Center for Live Cell Genomics will bring together a broad range of researchers in different departments at UC Santa Cruz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/david-haussler-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/david-haussler-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-300.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>73074</file-size><width>300</width><height>348</height></image><image-alt>David Haussler</image-alt><image-caption>David Haussler, Director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.

The center will deploy this new biotechnology to study neurodevelopmental diseases and cancer.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has built an international reputation as a leader in bioinformatics and genomics, working at the forefront of efforts to use genomics in precision medicine and biomedical research. With the new center, the Genomics Institute is spearheading transformational innovations in experimental platform design for large-scale, long-term genomic studies of disease processes in living cells and complex tissues. Advanced methods for growing three-dimensional cultures of human cells and tissues in the lab will be combined with &#8220;lab-on-a-chip&#8221; technologies and connected to the internet to create an inexpensive and scalable system with internet-based remote control and analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating a disruptive technology with an open-source bent to it, which we hope will ignite a revolution in biotechnology comparable to what has happened in information technology,&#8221; said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UCSC Genomics Institute. &#8220;We are moving toward a new way of building equipment and doing and sharing experiments on living cells, experiments that are crucial for understanding diseases and developing new ways to treat them.&#8221;</p>
<h2>New approach</h2>
<p>Genomic techniques such as RNA sequencing enable scientists to study patterns of gene expression in living cells, seeing which genes get turned on and off at different times and under different conditions. These studies help researchers understand disease processes and identify potential targets for new treatments. Traditional approaches involve growing cells in culture and harvesting them to extract RNA or DNA for sequencing, killing the cells in the process. But studying how gene expression changes as complex tissues, organs, and tumors develop over time requires a new approach, said Sofie Salama, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute and adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;With advances in stem cell biology, we can now grow highly complex, three-dimensional tissues that mimic either developing organs, like the brain organoids my lab works with, or that mimic tumors for cancer research,&#8221; Salama said. &#8220;Understanding these long-term cultures as they develop and get more complex over time requires a paradigm shift in our experimental approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The experimental platform envisioned by the new center will be automated, scalable, and internet-connected. It will include microfluidics systems with integrated molecular analysis capabilities; continuous imaging with low-cost microscopy systems; analysis of RNA and proteins from live tissues; and the capacity to monitor and control experiments remotely, compare results to large shared datasets in the cloud, and use machine learning to improve performance.</p>
<p>Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical and computer engineering, is co-principal investigator of the Center for Live Cell Genomics, bringing expertise in optofluidic chip technologies for biomedical diagnostics and molecular analysis. Schmidt, who holds the Narinder Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics and directs the W. M. Keck Nanofabrication Facility at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering, has developed a variety of integrated chip-based platforms for processing samples and analyzing individual biomolecules and viruses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to bring our devices and technologies to bear as part of a completely new paradigm, working with live cell cultures and bringing that to a more automated stage where it can be accessible to more people,&#8221; Schmidt said.</p>
<h2>Braingeneers</h2>
<p>The new center will bring together a broad range of researchers in different departments at UCSC, as well as collaborators at UCSF, Stanford, and other institutions. It will build on existing efforts such as the research on brain development led by Haussler, Salama, and others (the &#8220;<a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/">Braingeneers</a>&#8221; team), and the pediatric cancer genomics program (<a href="https://treehousegenomics.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a>) led by Olena Vaske, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology and Colligan Presidential Chair in Pediatric Genomics.</p>
<p>Development of the core live cell platform will build on several ongoing projects that have yielded devices, instruments, and software similar to most of the elements of the proposed system.</p>
<p>For example, Salama&#8217;s lab has been working with Mircea Teodorescu, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, and others to develop better ways of growing cerebral organoids. As stem cells develop into cortical neurons in the lab, they self-organize into layered structures similar to the brain's cortex, providing a three-dimensional model of living brain tissue for studying how the brain&#8217;s neural circuitry develops. Using technologies such as 3D-printed scaffolding to support the developing organoid and microfluidic pumps and channels for nutrient delivery, the team is developing a sophisticated, integrated system for growing and monitoring these cerebral organoids.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers are also investigating a promising approach for noninvasive genomic analysis by isolating &#8220;exosomes&#8221;&#8212;extracellular vesicles released from living cells that contain cargoes of RNA, proteins, and other molecules. &#8220;With our microfluidic systems, we are pumping media in and out of the culture, and the media we pump out is gold&#8212;by analyzing the nucleic acids and metabolites in that, we can find out what&#8217;s going on in the culture,&#8221; Salama said</p>
<h2>Picroscope</h2>
<p>Teodorescu&#8217;s team has also developed a low-cost microscopy system, called a &#8220;picroscope,&#8221; which is compatible with standard 24-well cell culture plates and provides continuous imaging as well as remote access for monitoring the growth and morphology of live cultures. The Genomics Institute has used this system to give students at Alisal High School in Salinas the opportunity to participate remotely in biology experiments during the COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021, when students weren&#8217;t even able to enter a classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working with their amazing biology teacher, Rebecca Ward, we had students use their cell phones to do experiments over the internet and watch zebrafish embryos develop from bundles of cells into fish,&#8221; Haussler said.</p>
<p>The new center&#8217;s education and outreach programs will include efforts to build on this pilot project and expand access to sophisticated biology experiments for students in under-resourced schools. Research scientist Mohammed Mostajo Radji and Genomics Institute Office of Diversity Director Zia Isola are leading efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the roll-out of education programs focused on these new technologies.</p>
<p>The picroscope also exemplifies the center&#8217;s open-source, custom-built approach to biotechnology equipment, taking advantage of inexpensive off-the-shelf components and 3D printing technology. &#8220;One of the side benefits of the world's amazing consumer technology is we now have a ten-dollar camera we can put in a microscope,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;Imagine a lab where the equipment is built, customized, and shared with other labs&#8212;that&#8217;s the life sciences of the future. It&#8217;s a disruptive technology compared to the traditional biotech equipment made for specialized purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haussler is also enthusiastic about the potential for connecting devices to a powerful computational infrastructure using secure communication between the cloud and internet-connected devices based on open-source Internet of Things (IoT) services. Among other things, this enables the use of artificial intelligence to monitor and control experiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI can control experiments while we sleep,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The scalability of the proposed platform also promises to make it cheaper and faster to conduct experiments. &#8220;For experiments that may cost thousands of dollars per test now, imagine if we could do tens of thousands of tests in parallel at orders of magnitude less cost per test. We need that capacity to understand the mechanisms of these complex diseases, and understanding is the first step to developing new treatments and therapies.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, sorry, excuse me,&#8221; was a constant refrain as groups of beaming undergraduates edged past each other on busy Pacific Avenue sidewalks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big draw was the first-ever Downtown Day, the result of a partnership between UC Santa Cruz and the Downtown Association. Informal, interactive, and fast-paced, the day included a scavenger hunt, street performances by student groups, and a free screening of Jordan Peele&#8217;s horror movie, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Santa Cruz Cinema. Peele&#8217;s movie was filmed in several locations in Santa Cruz, including the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spirited group of students&#8212;a mix of first-years, transfers, and returning third- and fourth-years&#8212;looked excited, grateful, and a bit overwhelmed by the bustle and activity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is really fun, but it&#8217;s a bit chaotic&#8212;so many students!&#8221; said Jasmine Nemerovski (Oakes &#8216;25, psychology). &#8220;I really appreciate all the local businesses and how welcoming they are. We just got a free taco.&#8221; Her freebie snack came courtesy of Snap Taco on Pacific Avenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Twist (Oakes &#8216;25, education) enjoyed the street scene but admitted that she was &#8220;kind of nervous&#8221; at the prospect of seeing the Jordan Peele horror film.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to go see it, but I won&#8217;t go by myself," she vowed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Day was also a chance for students including Scarlett Orantes (Oakes &#8216;25, art &amp; design: games and playable media) to discover what may well be their future hangouts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orantes found herself drawn to Comicopolis, the comic book store on Front Street near Bookshop Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This area seems so different from what I&#8217;m used to,&#8221; said Orantes, who comes from Los Angeles County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sunny and breezy Friday, students ate burritos, browsed through used-record bins, admired crystals, examined board shorts, and puzzled over bottles of so-called &#8220;Shark Repellent&#8221; hot sauce at Pizza My Heart.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a crowd of students lined up 50 deep at a kiosk handing out maps and instructions for the scavenger hunt focusing on local businesses, Andrew George, the prepared foods manager for the New Leaf Community Market in downtown Santa Cruz, stood by in admiration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Look at all these people," he said. &#8220;I am amazed, frankly. I moved to Santa Cruz at the height of the pandemic. It was mostly a ghost town. Now it is so vibrant and full of people. I even saw a protest&#8212;a walk against climate change!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scavenger hunt had cleverly worded instructions designed to tantalize students without confusing them too much.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One business provided the following clue: &#8220;I was founded on the &#8216;hottest day in Santa Cruz&#8217; in 2010, and I&#8217;ve been helping locals cool off ever since. Unfortunately, I do cost a little more than a penny!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That clue directed students straight to the Penny Ice Creamery on Cedar Street, which is co-founded and co-owned by alumna Kendra Baker (Crown &#8216;01, language studies). And fortunately, there was a helpful index on the other side of the clue card providing the answers to all seven scavenger hunt questions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The festive day included performances by the Sabrosura Latin Dance Troupe, as well as Cloud 9 A Cappella, the popular all-Slug singing group, which started its set with a creative mashup of several popular tunes, including &#8220;Kansas City,&#8221; a rhythm-and-blues song recorded by Fats Domino; &#8220;Roadhouse Blues" by the Doors; and &#8220;Pride and Joy&#8221; by Stevie Ray Vaughan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Day was so popular that a group of greeters ran out of their pile of 250 free goodie bags by 3 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is our first year doing this, and I was a little bit nervous because it&#8217;s during the week, school is in session, and I wondered how many people would turn out," said Haley Morrow (Stevenson &#8216;20, cognitive science), communications specialist for Government and Community Relations at UCSC. &#8220;But this is such a great crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz students are vital to the downtown economy," said Morrow, who planned the logistics of Downtown Day in collaboration with the Downtown Association of Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to make sure that students always feel welcome downtown," Morrow continued. &#8220;Even though their home is up on the hill at UCSC, their home is here, too.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d989942807270466cc00b00c9d842e2"><name>slug-strong-update-sept-28</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Slug Strong update: small number of campus cases, flu shots available</title><summary>The fall quarter has been off to a great start.

<p>Dear Campus Community</p>
<p>The fall quarter has been off to a great start. We are so proud of how everyone has risen to the challenges of providing proof of vaccination, getting tested and wearing masks.&#160;</p>
<p>While this work helps keep us all healthy and well, with the return of in-person interactions we will see an increase in positive cases. We need to remain vigilant in carrying out our mitigation efforts to keep those numbers low. We have had a total of 14 positive cases between Sept 20-26 and 10 of those involve residential students who are now quarantining, either on campus or at their permanent residence.</p>
<p>In addition to requiring that vaccinated students take one more COVID-19 test by Sept. 30, we will continue providing free and easy tests to everyone in our campus community.&#160;</p>

Kennerknecht cares so deeply about animals that he built a career in wildlife conservation photography to help fight for their survival
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wildlife conservation photographer Sebastian Kennerknecht and a biologist colleague were setting up a camera in Uganda when both heard the ear-splitting trumpet of an angry forest elephant. The jungle around them was dense, a tangle of vines, branches, and aerial roots. Suddenly, the forest seemed to explode in front of them. The elephant had charged.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was, said Kennerknecht, like the scene from the movie</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jurassic Park,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where a roaring T-Rex crashes through the landscape, flattening trees as if they were blades of grass.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennerknecht and the biologist ran.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wove through the dense vegetation, the charging, five-ton bull elephant hot on their heels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was so close, &#8220;you could feel the vibrations in the ground,&#8221; Kennerknecht said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the elephant gaining on them, the two men split up. The biologist went right and Kennerknecht turned left.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was enough of a confusing moment for the elephant to stop,&#8221; Kennerknecht said. &#8220;He did go back to my camera and mess with it a bit, however.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That elephant encounter was just one of the adventures the 2007 ecology and evolutionary biology graduate from College Eight (now Rachel Carson College) has had during his career as a wildlife conservation photographer. Specializing in photos of wild cats, Kennerknecht has traveled to five continents in pursuit of his craft. He has camped in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan in order to capture photos of the elusive snow leopard, a spot so remote it was a four-hour horseback ride just to get to the nearest road, and documented the phantom coastal jaguar preying on sea turtles in Costa Rica. He has missed plunging into a river chasm as the vehicle in which he rode fishtailed across a narrow bridge during a rainstorm, tracked endangered Arabian leopards in war-torn Yemen, and has the distinction of being the only photographer in the world to successfully take a high-resolution shot of the mysterious Borneo bay cat in the wild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His shots have appeared in newspapers, magazines, and on websites around the world. He spends up to nine months on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love animals and I love them so deeply that I care about their conservation as so many of their populations decline,&#8221; Kennerknecht, 36, said in a phone call during a rare moment at home in his small cabin in the hills of Pescadero. &#8220;For me, photography is the best tool in my tool belt to help in that fight.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the phone, Kennerknecht was voluble and animated, a born storyteller. It was at UC Santa Cruz, he said, that his passion for wildlife photography was born.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rambling through the forested campus where deer and coyotes wandered, Kennerknecht said, he became obsessed with bobcats. He read up on the cat&#8217;s behaviors, talked to a few professors, and staked out likely spots where bobcats might roam. It took two months but eventually he located a bobcat and her cub and was able to photograph the pair. One of his shots appeared in the local </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine. He was hooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennerknecht talked his way into an internship with famed Santa Cruz wildlife photographer Frans Lanting, missing his college graduation ceremony because he was with Lanting in Senegal helping capture images of tool-using chimpanzees but learning an important lesson, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Working for Frans, there was this moment of &#8216;Wow, I see how many people he reached with his photos,&#8217;&#8221; Kennerknecht said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what language you speak. When you see a photograph, you are able to feel empathy for the animal in it and that is huge for conservation.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one major problem about setting out to photograph some of the world&#8217;s most elusive cats, however: You have to find them first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Kennerknecht that means not only using his knowledge of animal behavior honed while he was at UC Santa Cruz but also working closely with scientists in the field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My whole education of ecology, of understanding why animals do what they do, was huge,&#8221; Kennerknecht said. &#8220;It got me from a level of loving animals to understanding animals. That was tremendous.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Tawau Hills Park on the island of Borneo, for instance, where he went to photograph the endangered bay cat, Kennerknecht learned one of the researchers&#8217; low-resolution video cameras had spotted the wild cat high on a ridgeline trail. Kennerknecht waded into the rainforest, which pulsed with the constant buzz of insects and was alive with biting ants, leeches, and nagging flies, and climbed to the ridge. There, he set up four waterproof SLR camera traps&#8212;cameras triggered by motion sensors&#8212;and went off to wait.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three weeks later, Kennerknecht&#8217;s now-mold covered cameras had caught no images of the cat, although, frustratingly, the researchers&#8217; video camera recorded a slightly blurry black-and-white image of the animal walking directly behind Kennerknecht&#8217;s equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A return trip, however, yielded the world&#8217;s only high-resolution image of the small, chestnut-colored cat in its habitat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a combination of working closely with biologists and understanding the ecology of the cat,&#8221; Kennerknecht said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also a product of Kennerknecht&#8217;s ability to suffer hardship and face risk in pursuit of his goal to raise awareness and protect the animals he loves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to be a voice for the animals that can&#8217;t speak for themselves,&#8221; Kennerknecht said. &#8220;I want to see them around [for a long time]. &#8230;I want to fight for them when they can&#8217;t fight for themselves.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His photographs of cats, from jaguars to ocelots and caracals, have garnered millions of views and have filled his calendar with assignments that take him from Europe to Africa and South America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, one of&#160; Kennerknecht&#8217;s most recent assignments brought him full circle, working with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Professor of Environmental Studies Chris Wilmers to capture shots of pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s someone who, one, has a sense of adventure and is tireless,&#8221; Wilmers said of Kennerknecht. &#8220;To get good photos you have to be out there all the time, you have to want to be out in the field, and, two, he also has a great eye and really understands the biology and the ecology of the species. Finally, he&#8217;s a wonderful guy to be around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, said Wilmers, whose team studies the effects of climate change and human activity on pumas, Kennerknecht volunteered his time to take the shots and gave them to the lab to use in whatever way was needed&#8212;an unusual gift for most wildlife photographers to give.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They [the shots] help us promote the work we do here,&#8221; Wilmers said.</span></p>

Directed by the UCSC <a href="https://ibsc.ucsc.edu/">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</a> (IBSC), the program will support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alumni of our training programs have excellent track records in achieving their desired career goals,&#8221; said IBSC Program Director Catharina Lindley. &#8220;We are particularly excited about welcoming mentors and trainees from the <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/">Science and Justice Research Center</a> to the new program. Incorporation of social and ethical aspects of stem cell research will give trainees valuable perspectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The training program places strong emphasis on individualized mentoring, cohort building, and creation of strong scientific and career networks. Mentors and trainees will be drawn from a variety of disciplines, including bioengineering, genomics, biology, and social sciences.</p>
<p>Since its start in 2005, the IBSC has built a cohesive interdisciplinary stem cell research community at UCSC. With a core stem cell research facility and classes in stem cell research and ethics, the institute brings together 31 laboratories led by faculty from seven different departments and three divisions.</p>
<p>The program will provide rigorous training in stem cell research under the guidance of an IBSC faculty mentor. Trainee research will focus on solving important problems in stem cell research using interdisciplinary and innovative approaches. Integrative core courses will bring together trainees from different scientific backgrounds to promote cross-fertilization and cohort building. Other components of the program include outreach and patient engagement opportunities and training in career development skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;A major goal of our program is to emphasize comprehension of the &#8216;big picture,&#8217; so that trainees can confidently identify key outstanding issues in the stem cell field and innovative routes to investigating them,&#8221; said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering and co-director of the IBSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC&#8217;s strength lies in pushing boundaries in basic sciences,&#8221; added co-director Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. &#8220;Interactions with translational and clinical medicine teams will enrich our trainees&#8217; perspectives and encourage fruitful collaborations in developing novel stem cell therapeutics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IBSC&#8217;s stem cell training and career development infrastructure has been strengthened by several recent grants, including an Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health, a graduate student training program funded by the UC-Hispanic Serving Institutions Doctoral Diversity Initiative, and a mentoring program funded by the Genentech Foundation.</p>
<p>The new program is expected to grow over the first few years, eventually serving eight Ph.D. students and six postdoctoral fellows per year by the third year of the program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="33ea9f01807270466cc00b00903359ad"><name>jinnah-harvard-advisory-committee</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Environmental governance expert Sikina Jinnah appointed to Harvard University’s SCoPEx advisory committee</title><summary>Jinnah was appointed to an independent advisory committee that will make governance recommendations for a proposed experiment intended build understanding of the potential efficacy and risks of stratospheric aerosols relevant to solar geoengineering.</summary><start-date>1632898800000</start-date><path>/2021/09/jinnah-harvard-advisory-committee</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/jinnah-harvard-advisory-committee</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1632958586603</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1632958586603</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/jinnah_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/jinnah_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jinnah_250.jpg</name><display-name>jinnah_250.jpg</display-name><file-size>53302</file-size><width>250</width><height>313</height></image><image-alt>Sikina Jinnah outdoors in front of a tree</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/jinnah_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/jinnah_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jinnah_80.jpg</name><display-name>jinnah_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23768</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sikina Jinnah outdoors in front of a tree</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor Sikina Jinnah</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor of Environmental Studies Sikina Jinnah was recently appointed to an independent advisory committee that will make recommendations regarding the governance of Harvard University&#8217;s high-profile SCoPEx research. SCoPEx, short for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, is a proposed small-scale particle physics and atmospheric chemistry experiment designed to build understanding of the potential efficacy and risks of stratospheric aerosols relevant to solar geoengineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the </span><a href="https://scopexac.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCoPEx Advisory Committee&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> roles is to collect and carefully consider feedback from stakeholders in the process of making recommendations about the future of SCoPEx, including recommendations on whether or not the project should move forward in some capacity. Jinnah will bring her expertise in global environmental governance to these efforts. She has studied participatory processes for governing emerging technologies like solar geoengineering, which have a high degree of uncertainty surrounding their efficacy and impacts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both the potential risks and the potential benefits from solar geoengineering could be transformative for the planet, so the stakes are incredibly high,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That makes stakeholder engagement crucially important. Planetary decision-making must be broad and inclusive. We need a model for governing this type of research in a way that&#8217;s socially responsible, engages a wide range of stakeholders, and ensures that marginalized voices are appropriately amplified.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar geoengineering is a technology that seeks to cool the planet and offset some impacts of climate change through methods like releasing particles into the air to reflect a small portion of sunlight away from the Earth. SCoPEx is not intended to trigger a climate response, but rather is an effort to collect relevant data to improve the accuracy of models that predict potential future impacts of solar geoengineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better models could inform global decision-making processes around whether or not these technologies should be developed. But there&#8217;s already a great deal of debate around that question, driven in part by uncertainties around what types of unintended harm solar geoengineering could potentially cause. There&#8217;s also concern that the perceived promise of these technologies could distract from the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons and others, some argue that it&#8217;s too risky to undertake any research related to solar geoengineering, including the SCoPEx experiment. An initial test flight related to the project had been scheduled to take place in Sweden in June of 2021, but it was cancelled following strong resistance from some scientists, environmentalists, and the Indigeous Saami people in Sweden.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinnah says governance of research on solar geoengineering will ultimately need to incorporate the needs and insights of stakeholders locally and globally, with particular emphasis on communities that face the greatest risk from climate change impacts.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="38313b4d807270466cc00b0017911f65"><name>ace-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ACE Fellow in the Office of the Chancellor</title><summary>I’m pleased to introduce Jason Smith, Associate Professor of Public Health at Cal State East Bay who will serve as a 2021-22 ACE Fellow in the Office of the Chancellor.</summary><start-date>1632985200000</start-date><display-name>ACE Fellow in the Office of the Chancellor</display-name><path>/2021/09/ace-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/ace-fellow</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1633030323002</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633030323002</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m pleased to introduce </span><a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/news-center/2021/03/professor-jason-smith-for-national-ace-fellowship.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Smith, Associate Professor of Public Health at Cal State East Bay who will serve as a 2021-22 ACE Fellow in the Office of the Chancellor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He earned his master&#8217;s degree in theology from Harvard Divinity School and law degree from Northeastern University. His academic work and teaching are in the areas of bioethics and public health law. Jason was selected for this opportunity through the competitive national ACE Fellow process and he selected three possible host institutions for his fellowship before identifying UC Santa Cruz as his top choice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Programs-Services/Pages/Professional-Learning/ACE-Fellows-Program.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACE Fellows Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facilitates professional development and deep learning about crucial topics in higher education through one-year placements at partner institutions. These fellowships elevate the fellow and the host institution as we share ideas and learn from one another. ACE Fellows typically go on to continued service in higher education as chief executive officers, chief academic officers, other cabinet-level positions, and deans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason&#8217;s focus for the fellowship will be on the ways higher education institutions are working to be resilient in the face of the climate crisis and the ways a commitment to social justice informs those resilience strategies. You can expect to see Jason in a range of leadership and planning meetings and engaging in campus life. Jason will also be engaging with campus leaders one-on-one and in groups to learn more about their roles and leadership trajectories. You can contact Jason directly at jsmith58@ucsc.edu.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join me in welcoming Jason to UC Santa Cruz!</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3836bc19807270466cc00b00ec1a1de0"><name>pest-management-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Systemwide review of UC Pest Management Policy</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Integrated Pest Management (“IPM”).</summary><start-date>1632985200000</start-date><display-name>Systemwide review of UC Pest Management Policy</display-name><path>/2021/09/pest-management-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/pest-management-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1633030683654</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633030737905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Integrated Pest Management (&#8220;IPM&#8221;).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>This new policy addresses the following key issues:</p>

<p>Would you believe that in the 18th and 19th centuries, that city was New Orleans?</p>
<p>&#8220;We already know New Orleans is a rich city when it comes to history and culture,&#8221; said Rafael Delgadillo, a UC Santa Cruz doctoral student in Latin American and Latino Studies. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to understand how much of that richness is connected to Latin America.&#8221;</p>
<p>People forget that Spain controlled New Orleans from 1762&#8211;1803 and the city was a frequent stop for travelers arriving from the Caribbean and Central and South America, Delgadillo said. Benito Juarez, known as the &#8220;George Washington of Mexico,&#8221; lived in New Orleans with other Mexican exiles during two separate periods in the 1850s. There&#8217;s a statue of Juarez on Basin Street.</p>
<p>Exiles from Cuba also showed up in the 19th century, said Delgadillo, pointing out that a steam ship from Havana to New Orleans only took four days. The Cubans lived alongside immigrants from Spain, which led to some conflict as the islanders were trying to overthrow Spanish rule.</p>
<p>Delgadillo, who grew up in New Orleans, is exploring the Latin American connections to his hometown for his doctoral thesis. &#8220;In one way, I&#8217;m looking at New Orleans&#8217; colonial foundations and how that set a tone in its distinctiveness in the U.S.,&#8221; he said during a recent call from the city not long after Hurricane Ida blew through.</p>
<p>Delgadillo&#8217;s family is originally from the Dominican Republic and landed in New Orleans after a brief stint in New York. New Orleans has been historically so popular with Caribbeans that it has been called the &#8220;northern most Caribbean city,&#8221; Delgadillo said.</p>
<p>As in the Caribbean, New Orleans was home to many Africans who were enslaved and shipped in by the European colonial powers. In both places, the people who were enslaved were converted to Catholicism and a racial caste system developed. While in other areas of the New World, people were categorized as either black or white, in New Orleans and the Caribbean, a more nuanced system emerged where racial mixture mattered, Delgadillo said.</p>
<p>Delgadillo has been researching New Orleans&#8217; diverse collection of Spanish language newspapers to learn more of the history. Spanish newspapers have been serving the city since 1808, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this understudied history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of those newspapers shine light on these (immigrant) communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the advent of the 20th century, the pattern of immigration to New Orleans changed with the majority arriving from Honduras. This had to do with the banana trade as United Fruit Company had its headquarters in New Orleans.</p>
<p>After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, more Mexican immigrant construction workers arrived to help with reconstruction with their wives often working in the service industry, Delgadillo said.</p>
<p>Today, however, the Hispanic population of New Orleans is quite low at only about 5 percent. More Hispanics live outside the city in neighboring parishes.</p>
<p>Delgadillo said he appreciates having the opportunity to do his research at the city he has loved for most of his life. &#8220;This is all driven by my passion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s home.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="38ca4872807270466cc00b008699bc92"><name>face-covering-continues</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus indoor face coverings requirement continues</title><summary>Face coverings, in addition to the vaccinations and our testing program, continue to be a key element of our campus mitigation plan. </summary><start-date>1632985200000</start-date><display-name>Campus indoor face coverings requirement continues</display-name><path>/2021/09/face-covering-continues</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/face-covering-continues</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1633040353370</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581338286</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/pdfs/Coronavirus/Santa%2520Cruz%2520County%2520Moves%2520to%2520Moderate%2520Community%2520Transmission_092921.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633120075068000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq3RGH61wdLWn9VERLfvAgm4HkIw" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/pdfs/Coronavirus/Santa%20Cruz%20County%20Moves%20to%20Moderate%20Community%20Transmission_092921.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz County announced</a> Wednesday that it rescinded its indoor face mask requirement.

This is a welcome sign of progress for those in Santa Cruz County and our university community.</p>
<p><strong>Indoor face covering requirements remain in effect at UCSC.</strong> Face coverings, in addition to the vaccinations and our testing program, continue to be a key element of our campus mitigation plan. Because of the shift in the Santa Cruz County requirement, we want to clarify for our campus community that face coverings continue to be required while inside campus facilities, including classrooms. This is true regardless of vaccination status. Individuals are not required to wear face coverings when alone in single occupant rooms or offices with closed doors not open to the public or when in a personal residence or private residence hall room, though masks are required in shared spaces such as residence hall hallways, group bathrooms and lounges.</p>
<p>The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633120075068000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMP2Vs56XPokyJ9RnMlqjKcJ8yuw" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">state face covering guidelines</a> also apply. Currently, the state requires a face covering, regardless of vaccination status, when accessing public transit, healthcare settings, adult and senior care facilities, indoor spaces in K-12 schools, childcare and other youth settings, state and local correctional facilities and detention centers, homeless shelters, emergency shelters, and cooling centers. The state also requires unvaccinated individuals to wear face masks in indoor public places, such as retail, restaurants, theaters, family entertainment centers, meetings, and state and local government offices that serve the public, and recommends the same for vaccinated individuals.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz has invited city and county leaders to help develop a framework for sustainable implementation following approval of the campus&#8217;s 2021 Long Range Development Plan by UC Regents today.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Chancellor Cynthia Larive said UC Santa Cruz will continue to work closely with elected officials to balance the need for educational access for California&#8217;s students with community concerns, particularly around housing, traffic, and water.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I believe we can both fulfill our mission to serve California and continue to be a great neighbor in Santa Cruz,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;With the plan approved, we can focus on addressing the remaining concerns. The campus, city and county have a strong relationship, and I know we&#8217;re on the path toward resolution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campus, city and county leaders signed an agreement earlier in the week that lays the groundwork to start formal discussions about charting a path forward and resolving concerns connected to the 2021 LDRP.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For the next 20 years, the 2021 LRDP will serve as a blueprint for future physical development on campus, detailing at a high level how the main campus and Westside Research Park might develop over the next two decades. The plan is the result of more than four years of work by campus leaders and planners with extensive collaboration with campus and community members.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The proposed LRDP does not detail specific projects. It functions essentially as a land-use document, identifying where students, staff and faculty could be housed and where spaces for learning and research could be created, while also imagining the infrastructure needed to connect it all. It is informed by community input and the university&#8217;s ambitions for the coming decades, including continued advancement of its academic and research missions, expanded access to higher education for the next generation of Californians, and more on-campus housing opportunities for students and employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Chancellor Cynthia Larive presented the plan, the accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program to the UC Board of Regents Finance and Capital Strategies Committee on Wednesday afternoon. Committee members, who unanimously approved the plan, sending it to the full board for consideration today, asked several questions, including about the objective to provide housing for 100 percent of students beyond 19,500.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Board members also asked about the campus&#8217;s efforts to reduce per-use potable water demand by increasing reliance on stormwater runoff and recycled water, and about conducting engineering audits on campus water use, a mitigation measure in the plan&#8217;s Final Environmental Impact Report.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other questions focused on reducing car trips, and the mitigation measure for Transportation Demand Management programs the campus will pursue to encourage pedestrian, bicycle and transit use, including the addition of on-campus housing for students and employees.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Regents commended the plan&#8217;s inclusion of employee housing. Larive explained that within the University of California, UC Santa Cruz already provides one of the highest number of employee housing units, and will continue to do so as we add additional housing over the next 20 years. Regents also noted the campus&#8217; efforts to minimize the developable area in high-fire severity zones on campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Board members noted that legally-binding mitigation measures are inherent parts of the plan.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I think we are going forward in a responsible manner,&#8221; UC Board of Regents Chair Cecilia Estolano said. &#8220;We are meeting the state of California&#8217;s needs &#8212; but we are doing it in a much more conservation-oriented approach, a much more compact development than the previous LRDP had, so I am very pleased to support this LRDP.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Estolano underscored the importance of continuing to partner with local leaders, urging the campus to continue conversations with the members of the Santa Cruz City Council who spoke during public comment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Board of Regents Vice Chair Richard Lieb commended Larive on the process the campus went through in developing the plan, and addressed concerns raised about impacts and mitigation measures. &#8220;I want to reaffirm what our chair has said, as well as what you have said,&#8221; Lieb said, &#8220;which is that ... the mitigations contained in the document will be enforced and we will live by those documents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The UC Santa Cruz of the future will continue to be an extraordinary natural environment where students, faculty, and staff teach, learn, research, live, and work. The campus of 2040 will be more connected, functional and flexible, with facilities complementing the landscape &#8212; just as campus founders first imagined nearly 60 years ago. It is, and will continue to be, a place of resilience that advances innovation, inspires the next generation of leaders and innovators, and addresses society&#8217;s most challenging issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Based on campus and community feedback, the plan:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Continues to embrace and respect the original vision for the campus.&#160;</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Advances a compact footprint for learning, research and housing spaces.&#160;</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Increases the campus natural reserve, used for ecological and educational purposes, while also promoting outdoor activities that contribute to health and wellness.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Proposes sites for up to four new residential colleges, advancing our unique and transformative residential college-system structure, which offers students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Expands housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Includes housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, based on demand.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Improves circulation on campus with a focus on alternative modes of transportation to reduce single-occupancy car trips.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz developed an extensive countywide outreach campaign to gather a wide range of perspectives on the plan. Campus formed a Community Advisory Group, made up of leaders from local government, the education sector, and neighborhood and community groups, some of whom have challenged the university on its long-range plans in the past. Public-input workshops were held, and an online public survey conducted. Three land-use planning workshops were held, followed by presentations on the proposed land-use map. Three scoping sessions in advance of developing the draft EIR were held in spring 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>University of California policy requires each of its campuses to regularly update a long-range development plan. The exercise requires campuses to set specific parameters &#8212; a time horizon and an enrollment figure &#8212; to thoughtfully plan for the future.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Long-range development plans are sometimes mischaracterized as enrollment growth plans. In reality, decisions about enrollment are driven by many ongoing and evolving factors including student demand, state funding, and campus capacity.</span></p>
<span></span><span>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s now approved plan will guide the campus through the next two decades and forecast what infrastructure and spaces the campus might need to serve up to 28,000 students, a figure that city and university leaders in the 1960s imagined the university reaching by 1990. A comprehensive plan, informed by feedback from the campus community, the general public, and the university&#8217;s large network of alumni and supporters helps current and future university leaders make good, comprehensive decisions.</span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to fully predict university life 20 years from now,&#8221; Larive said. For example, the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown, and they may lead to changes in campus operations, such as increased remote work for some employees and more online and hybrid instruction. &#8220;But it is prudent that our campus produces a well-thought-out roadmap that can serve as a guide regardless of what the year 2040 brings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Since its founding in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has been on an unprecedented trajectory, producing transformative research and scholarship that serves society while graduating more than 140,000 students who are making their own contributions locally, regionally and globally. UC Santa Cruz joined the&#160;Association of American Universities in 2019, an astonishing achievement for a university not even 60 years old, underscoring the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching. UC Santa Cruz now shares the distinction of being the youngest member of this esteemed 66-member association and one of only four members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Leading at the intersection of creativity, innovation and justice, UC Santa Cruz continues to draw students eager to create real, transformative change. The recognition and commitment to social justice has increased interest from prospective students. The diversity of the student population is growing, and each year the campus welcomes thousands of students who are from low-income backgrounds and who will be the first in their families to earn four-year degrees. This focus on opportunity and access serves California and defines the university&#8217;s mission.</span></p>

It is a blueprint for future physical development on our campus, painting in broad strokes how our main campus and Westside Research Park might develop over the next two decades. The plan identifies where students, staff and faculty could be housed, where new spaces for learning and research could be created, and what land should be off-limits to construction.</p>
<p>I am delighted to pass along the news that the UC Board of Regents earlier today overwhelmingly endorsed our vision, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/lrdp-approval.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633186534766000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO4db0kNHpSirkubf2ql3BeXzwGQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/lrdp-approval.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unanimously approving our 2021 Long Range Development Plan</a>. The vote capped years of collaboration and brainstorming, covering thousands of hours of work by campus planners and leaders plus extensive input from campus and community members that resulted in significant changes to our initial plan.</p>
<p>Even with the approval, though, our work is not finished. We will continue to collaborate with the city&#8217;s and county&#8217;s elected officials to balance the need for educational access for California&#8217;s next generation of leaders with community concerns, particularly around housing, traffic, and water. I am convinced that we can both fulfill our mission to serve California while also reaching agreement with government leaders on a framework to thoughtfully implement the plan. We have long been a good neighbor to the city and county, and that will continue. We are truly better when we work in unison.</p>
<p>The plan respects the original vision for our campus, which opened in 1965, and is shaped by substantial feedback from our community partners. Among the LRDP highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes a compact footprint for learning, research and housing spaces.</li>
<li>It proposes sites for up to four new residential colleges, advancing our unique residential college-system structure.</li>
<li>It expands housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500. We are currently at about 18,500 students.</li>
<li>It includes housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, with more housing possible if demand rises.</li>
<li>It increases campus natural reserve space, which is used for ecological, educational and recreational purposes.</li>
<li>It improves circulation on campus with new bikeways and pedestrian paths, focusing on alternative modes of transportation to reduce single-occupancy car trips.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan approval is a milestone for our campus. It will guide us through the next two decades, providing us a framework to support students who in most cases have yet to be born. The campus 20 years into the future could serve up to 28,000 students, a figure that city and university leaders in the 1960s imagined the university reaching by 1990. It is important to caution, however, that the LRDP is not an enrollment plan. It details where campus facilities would go should growth occur. Decisions about enrollment are driven by many factors including demand, state funding, and campus capacity. Regental approval today does not authorize any particular project to go forward. Any project would need its own approval process and environmental review. What it does do is help current and future university leaders make good, comprehensive decisions, and I am excited that the Regents fully endorsed our vision.</p>
<p>Many of you reading this message are new to our campus. We are thrilled to have you. Please know that this plan, which addresses our long-range future, is far from all that we are working on to provide for our students. We are moving dirt right now on an expansive <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/kresge-renewal-kickoff-construction.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633186534767000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGBaMVahmRj8rL2JUNjc-7stFy7w" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/kresge-renewal-kickoff-construction.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project that will increase academic space, rehab some existing classrooms, and add nearly 200 beds at Kresge College</a>, and we are exploring options that could add hundreds of more beds. The UC Regents earlier this year approved our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633186534767000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPSw1SsEAfp9C6Iax9wRKXjTm7hw" href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Housing West project</a>, which will allow us to build 3,000 or so additional on-campus beds for existing students. Opponents, however, continue to challenge the project in court, stalling its construction. We remain optimistic that reason will prevail and that we will be able to move forward with this important project so desperately needed by our students and the community.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is on an extraordinary trajectory and continues to receive research, education and social-impact accolades that should make every Californian proud. This plan lays a strong foundation for an even brighter future for our campus, protecting what is special about our campus and showing us to be a good community partner.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77dbfeab807270172c1b96bd153d46b8"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>September</title><start-date>1630479600000</start-date><display-name>September</display-name><path>/2021/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/09/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1608328674972</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609787665951</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
