</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For assistant professor of sociology James Doucet-Battle, diabetes research is personal. His grandmother was diabetic, and that&#8217;s part of what inspired him to delve into the issue through the lens of African American experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in this notion that there is a racial component to risk for type 2 diabetes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to unpack the ways in which African Americans&#8212;and, increasingly, Latino people&#8212;are held up as examples of high-risk type 2 diabetes populations.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diabetes is a medical condition that affects the body&#8217;s ability to regulate blood sugar levels, and in type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to insulin, the hormone produced in the pancreas that normally helps cells convert blood sugar into energy. African American people are far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white Americans. But why? And what are the effects of this disparity?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some of the questions that Doucet-Battle wanted to explore. And now, his new book, </span><a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/sweetness-in-the-blood#:&#126;:text=Race%2C%20Risk%2C%20and%20Type%202%20Diabetes&amp;text=In%20a%20rousing%20indictment%20of,2%20diabetes%20risk%20and%20race."><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetness in the Blood: Race, Risk, and Type 2 Diabetes</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">captures findings from that journey in a way that challenges assumptions about race within diabetes research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first phase of the project, Doucet-Battle studied how African American populations with diabetes interact with researchers, healthcare professionals, and diabetes technologies, like glucometers. In particular, he wanted to uncover how the history of racism in the United States has affected trust between African American communities and biomedical researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doucet-Battle also studied a Silicon Valley-based biotechnology company&#8217;s efforts to design a diabetes risk algorithm and examined how they navigated race in projecting health outcomes. The company had sought out an African American test group and a group of participants from Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. It struck Doucet-Battle that both Mauritius and parts of the United States were once sugar colonies. That launched him into a study of how the global geography of diabetes reflects the history of colonialism and slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also worked with epidemiologists, molecular biologists, and genomicists across the country to look for diabetes risk factors in mitochondrial DNA, a maternally inherited chromosome that plays an important role in human metabolic adaptation to environmental change. Through this work&#8212;spurred by the 2013 mapping of the genome and epigenome of the maternally derived HeLa cells of Henrietta Lacks&#8212;he demonstrates the importance of analyzing gender before attempting to examine the social construct of race.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Doucet-Battle says researchers who want to better understand diabetes risk should focus more attention on social factors, because &#8220;risk is as socially, culturally, politically, and economically created as it is biologically.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he explained that type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with body weight, and many type 2 diabetics may be able to reduce or eliminate their dependence on medication through diet and exercise. Similarly, those who are prediabetic could reduce their risk of developing the disease. However, Doucet-Battle notes that &#8220;the cultural and economic impulses in this country are mitigating against that.&#8221; And one of those factors is inequality in access to physical activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we can stay relatively healthy here in Santa Cruz County walking up and down the verdant hills of the Central Coast, for a lot of people, getting that recommended 180 minutes of aerobic exercise per week is quite a challenge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Particularly when you&#8217;re living in resource-deprived, unsafe, or aesthetically challenging areas.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his future research, Doucet-Battle wants to continue exploring how barriers to physical activity affect diabetes risk and treatment outcomes. He&#8217;s particularly interested in taking a regional look at how COVID-19 lockdowns and poor air quality during California&#8217;s 2020 wildfire season have affected the lives of diabetics. To study this, he&#8217;s assembling a team of UC Santa Cruz undergraduate researchers, with funding from the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/mitchell-belonging.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Belonging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program administered by the </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, when he looks back at the experience of writing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetness In The Blood,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Doucet-Battle says it has helped him visualize the intersection of race, gender, history, and scientific knowledge production in new ways that will have a lasting effect on his approach to research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came into this project as a medical anthropologist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I came out of it as a social scientist of science.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf696983807270172c1b96bd44e9ccfb"><name>environmental-trade-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Shedding light on one of environmental policy’s most under-the-radar strategies</title><summary>Associate professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinnah studies the environmental provisions contained within trade agreements and wants to help policymakers better navigate this space.</summary><start-date>1609747200000</start-date><display-name>Trade Policy Environmental Effects</display-name><path>/2021/01/environmental-trade-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/environmental-trade-policy</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1609797560676</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610134170177</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/sikina-jinnah-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/sikina-jinnah-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sikina-jinnah-350.jpg</name><display-name>sikina-jinnah-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>46430</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>Sikina Jinnah poses outdoors in a forest setting.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/sikina-jinnah-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/sikina-jinnah-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sikina-jinnah-80.jpg</name><display-name>sikina-jinnah-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21665</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sikina Jinnah poses outdoors in a forest setting.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Associate professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinnah's&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent book&#160;is the first to examine the impacts of linkages between preferential trade agreements and environmental policy on a global scale.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Faculty insights illuminate the role of environmental provisions in international trade agreements</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the leadup to this month&#8217;s presidential inauguration, environmental advocates across the country are theorizing about how a new administration might advance policy on issues like climate change and biodiversity. But UC Santa Cruz associate professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinnah says there&#8217;s one particular channel that&#8217;s typically overlooked by both advocates and policymakers alike: trade agreements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinnah studies the environmental provisions contained within trade agreements, particularly the smaller preferential trade agreements between two or more countries that have proliferated rapidly outside of the World Trade Organization.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is important for people who care about environmental policy and social justice because environmental provisions in preferential trade agreements serve as a shadow forum where environmental policy is being diffused across the globe in ways that are unnoticed by most people.&#8221; Jinnah said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their best, these types of agreements foster collaboration, capacity-building and technology transfer between countries and provide new regulatory tools for implementing existing treaties like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) or the Paris Agreement on climate change. At their worst, preferential trade agreements can exacerbate power imbalances between countries and even cause serious domestic conflict.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Jinnah&#8217;s most recent book, written in collaboration with political scientist Jean-Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Morin, endeavors to shed light on the challenges and opportunities presented by preferential trade agreements. The book, titled </span><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/greening-through-trade"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greening through Trade: How American Trade Policy Is Linked To Environmental Protection Abroad</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the first to examine the impacts of linkages between preferential trade agreements and environmental policy on a global scale, and it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">includes recommendations to help policymakers better navigate this space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preferential trade agreements reached a new level of global importance in the late 2000s, when a major shift in U.S. trade policy made violation of environmental provisions within trade agreements enforceable under the dispute settlement mechanisms contained within the agreements. That meant a trading partner&#8217;s failure to meet environmental provisions could potentially result in the United States imposing sanctions or monetary penalties.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of strong enforcement measures are not usually contained within environmental treaties, so when stipulations from treaties like CITES are included within U.S. preferential trade agreements, it adds a new level of urgency for trading partners to meet existing international environmental commitments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinnah and her coauthor argue that this influence must be used cautiously and responsibly. To advance environmental goals in equitable ways, U.S. trade agreements should give international trading partners flexibility to tailor implementation timelines and strategies in ways that appropriately fit their socio-political and economic contexts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these conditions are met, preferential trade agreements could be an important tool for U.S. policymakers who are looking to tackle urgent global issues like biodiversity loss or potentially climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re really underutilizing trade agreements as a means to address climate change,&#8221; Jinnah said. &#8220;I would encourage any administration that&#8217;s interested in ensuring we use a full suite of tools for addressing climate change to think about trade agreements in that light as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach would require a policy change, since domestic law currently prohibits the inclusion of specific greenhouse gas mitigation provisions in trade agreements. But the Trade Promotion Authority laws that guide implementation of U.S. trade agreements are set to expire on July 1, 2021, and the renewal process could offer Congress an opportunity to chart a new path forward.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Jinnah said the &#8220;fast track&#8221; process through which U.S. trade policy is developed and approved makes it an unusually stable avenue for ensuring a baseline set of environmental standards that can weather variance in presidential administrations or the controlling party in Congress.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason and many others, Jinnah hopes policymakers will begin to pay increased attention to these types of agreements in the years to come. With more awareness, environmental provisions in trade agreements could achieve their highest potential as a policy tool and get the oversight needed to protect the rights of all trading partners in that process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be really sensitive to building international environmental policy in a way that allows countries to take high-level goals and implement them in ways that make sense domestically,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This shouldn&#8217;t be a one-size-fits-all approach.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cfb634f2807270172c1b96bd399e4817"><name>wildfire-relief-fund</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Friends of Lick Observatory helps fund wildfire recovery efforts</title><summary>The group has designated $75,000 for the emergency support of wildfire relief efforts at Lick Observatory, where telescopes were saved but infrastructure was damaged.</summary><keywords>Claire Max, Andrew Fraknoi</keywords><start-date>1609858800000</start-date><display-name>Friends of Lick Observatory helps fund wildfire recovery efforts</display-name><path>/2021/01/wildfire-relief-fund</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/wildfire-relief-fund</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1609802593493</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609863259020</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/firefighter-lick-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/firefighter-lick-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>firefighter-lick-410.jpg</name><display-name>firefighter-lick-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>166486</file-size><width>410</width><height>307</height></image><image-alt>firefighter on hillside by house</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/firefighter-lick-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/firefighter-lick-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>firefighter-lick-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>firefighter-lick-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24796</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>firefighter on hillside</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Firefighters were able to save most of the buildings on Mt.

Hamilton in August, the University of California&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/main/index.html">Lick Observatory</a> is facing major expenses associated with repairing damaged infrastructure. Although firefighters were able to save the major structures of the observatory, including all of the telescope domes, damage to peripheral buildings and infrastructure was extensive and recovery efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Immediate support for wildfire relief efforts at Lick Observatory is now being provided by the <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/main/support/folo.html">Friends of Lick Observatory</a> (FoLO), which has designated $75,000 for this purpose. FoLO is a membership-based organization dedicated to supporting the observatory and has long played a crucial role in providing funding and volunteers for community outreach programs and events.</p>
<p>Andrew Fraknoi, chair of the Board of Directors of FoLO and emeritus chair of the astronomy department at Foothill College, said the designation of funds was prompted by an urgent need to start doing emergency repairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total amount of damage is still being assessed, but in the meantime, there are things that really need to be repaired as soon as possible,&#8221; Fraknoi said.</p>
<p>Claire Max, director of UC Observatories and the Bachmann professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said practically every window was cracked in the houses of the small community of observatory employees who live on Mt. Hamilton. Aside from cracked windows, most of the residences had minimal damage, but two homes need more extensive repairs, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 27 people who live on the mountain, and we need them to be safe and comfortable in their homes, because we are nothing without our employees,&#8221; Max said. &#8220;The windows are all taped or boarded up now, but our worry is that winter storms could create real problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winter storms could also cause serious erosion and slides on the burned hillsides, so another priority is replacing wooden retaining walls that burned, cleaning culverts, and other erosion-control efforts to keep the hillsides intact. Two peripheral structures burned in the fire, an older residence that was not being used and a storage structure, and those require demolition and debris removal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brick walls of the Barnard House are still standing, and the first strong winds blew down the chimney, so taking that down to the ground and removing the material is high on the list,&#8221; Max said.</p>
<p>The total cost of the damage caused by the wildfire won&#8217;t be known until after contractors submit their bids, but it is likely to be in the millions of dollars, Max said.</p>
<p>In addition to designating its own funds, FoLO is encouraging people to make donations to the <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=1026">UCO Director&#8217;s Discretionary Fund</a> by offering a free FoLO membership for donations of $50 or more. Members receive advance notice of Lick Observatory events, discounts at the gift store, and other benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is less awareness of the need now that the fire is out of the news, and many people only heard that the observatory was saved&#8212;they didn&#8217;t hear about the damage to some of the buildings and infrastructure,&#8221; Fraknoi said.</p>
<p>The observatory remains closed to visitors, but astronomers have been able to resume telescope operations, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of firefighters, Max said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Calfire people worked hard to keep the fire away from the telescopes, and it really paid off,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were wonderful, and the core of the observatory wasn&#8217;t damaged, but there are a lot of repairs to do on the surrounding infrastructure.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0f8611b807270172c1b96bdabe968da"><name>judy-yung</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz scholar of Chinese American history Judy Yung dies at 74</title><summary>Judy Yung, a pioneering author and scholar of Chinese American and women's history, died on December 14, 2020.</summary><keywords>Judy Yung UCSC obituary, in memoriam</keywords><start-date>1609824900000</start-date><display-name>Judy Yung </display-name><path>/2021/01/judy-yung</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/judy-yung</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1609823707385</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609827635277</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>American Studies</value><value>History</value><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/judy-yung-screen-300.png</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/judy-yung-screen-300.png</link><site>news</site><name>judy-yung-screen-300.png</name><display-name>judy-yung-screen-300.png</display-name><file-size>193557</file-size><width>300</width><height>325</height></image><image-alt>Judy Yung</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/judy-yung-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/judy-yung-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>judy-yung-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>judy-yung-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27187</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Judy Yung</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Judy Yung, emerita professor of American studies, author, and scholar of Chinese American history at UC Santa Cruz, died on December 14, 2020, at age 74.</span></p>
<p><span>She was co-author of the landmark 2010 book, </span><span><i>Angel Island: Immigrant Gateway to America</i>, the official publication commemorating the 100th anniversary of Angel Island Immigration station in San Francisco Bay, offering a comprehensive history of West Coast immigration policies that excluded Asians and barred them from becoming naturalized citizens.</span></p>
<p><span>Yung's research on Angel Island was personal; her father was a detainee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>She was also the author of <i>Unbound Voices: A Documentary History of Chinese Women in San Francisco</i>. Drawing upon an intimate collection of letters, poems, autobiographies, newspaper clippings, and oral histories, the book portrays the lives of 40 Chinese American women from the late 1800s through World War II, creating a picture of their ability to make a home for themselves in America, despite severe racial, economic, and cultural constraints.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Unbound Voices</i> was written as a sequel to Yung&#8217;s 1995 book, <i>Unbound Feet</i>, a 10-year project that earned the 1996 National Book Award in History from the Association of Asian American Studies. She is additionally the author of <i>Chinese Women of America: A Pictorial History</i> and co-author of I<i>sland: Poetry and History of Chinese Immigrants on Angel Island, 1910-1940</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;People contribute to diversity in different ways,&#8221; Yung observed. &#8220;For me, my contribution is to do research and add the voices of Chinese American women to the tableau of history.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Born in 1946 and raised in San Francisco Chinatown, </span><span>Yung taught at UC Santa Cruz from 1990 until her retirement in 2004.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Judy Yung was a mainstay of the American Studies Department at UCSC, and initiated many courses in Asian American history, and Chinese American women&#8217;s history,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz emerita professor of feminist studies Bettina Aptheker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;She was a brilliant teacher, inspiring her students, and mentoring scores of them. She was an outstanding scholar, and her published works provided us with some of the most important historical material on Chinese and Chinese American women&#8217;s history.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;In the early 2000&#8217;s, Judy and I worked together to educate the campus and community on the importance of affirmative action, its history, its need, and its connection to the 1960s Civil Rights movement, and the formation of Ethnic Studies, Black Studies and Women&#8217;s Studies,&#8221; Aptheker added. &#8220;I treasured Judy as a colleague and friend, and deeply mourn her passing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Yung married Eddie Fung in 2003, the only Chinese America soldier captured by the Japanese in World War II. She was introduced to Fung by a military historian while doing research on Asian American men who had been in the U.S. Army and were taken as prisoners of war. Yung did nearly 50 hours of interviews with Fung that eventually led to a book titled <i>The Adventure of Eddie Fung: Chinatown Kid, Texas Cowboy, Prisoner of War</i>. He died in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>Judy Yung was a pioneering scholar in Chinese American and women's history,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history Alice Yang. &#8220;She played a critical&#160;role in teaching and mentoring many undergraduate and graduate students in Asian American studies. She also recruited and supported faculty and staff, myself included, as we tried to mount a curriculum in Asian American studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard from countless faculty, staff, and alumni about how heartbroken they are at her passing and am working with this group and Judy&#8217;s family to organize a celebration of her life and to establish a memorial fund to honor her contributions to UCSC and the field of Asian American Studies.&#8221;</span></p>

I was delighted earlier this week when I was finally able to flip my calendar from 2020 to 2021. Surely I was not alone. Never has a new year been more eagerly awaited!</p>
<p>The new year is a time of reflection and resolution, an opportunity to look back at what was while also envisioning what can be. For our campus community, 2020 was challenging. But as hard as 2020 was, it also revealed just how resilient we are. We quickly uprighted remote instruction. We pioneered new ways to build community. We built from scratch a diagnostic testing lab that has now become an invaluable resource for the entire county. We rallied to help our neighbors even as we faced our own challenges.</p>
<p>I am in awe of what we accomplished together in 2020. It is what makes me optimistic about 2021. The first round of COVID-19 vaccinations arrived before 2020 ended, giving health-care providers a jump start on inoculating our most vulnerable community members. This pandemic will not disappear overnight and the pain of its impacts will linger. Some will struggle with resulting health issues. Too many have lost loved ones or businesses built over a lifetime. But this pandemic will end, and I am confident that we will emerge stronger, more knowledgeable, and ultimately more capable of meeting the challenges of our time. We have already shown what we are able to accomplish when we work together.</p>
<p>Thank you for your commitment to UC Santa Cruz. I am deeply grateful for your hard work, and I look forward to the excellence we will achieve together in the year ahead. Best wishes for 2021!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d3bf7beb807270172c1b96bdbf6e78b5"><name>groundwater-discharge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New analysis highlights importance of groundwater discharge into oceans</title><summary>A global assessment of the impact of groundwater on ocean chemistry is important for understanding the weathering of rocks and its effects on climate.</summary><keywords>Kimberly Mayfield, Kimberly Bitterwolf, Adina Paytan</keywords><start-date>1610100000000</start-date><display-name>New analysis highlights importance of groundwater discharge into oceans</display-name><path>/2021/01/groundwater-discharge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/groundwater-discharge</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1609870310351</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610121209682</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/groundwater-discharge-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/groundwater-discharge-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>groundwater-discharge-410.jpg</name><display-name>groundwater-discharge-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>157548</file-size><width>410</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt>groundwater discharge on beach</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/groundwater-discharge-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/groundwater-discharge-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>groundwater-discharge-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>groundwater-discharge-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20729</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>groundwater discharge on beach</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Coastal groundwater discharge can sometimes be seen at low tide as rivulets flowing into the ocean, as on this beach on Oahu.

Scientists have tended to disregard its contributions to ocean chemistry, focusing on the far greater volumes of water and dissolved material entering the sea from rivers and streams, but a new study finds groundwater discharge plays a more significant role than had been thought.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20248-3">published January 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, have implications for global models of biogeochemical cycles and for the interpretation of isotope records of Earth&#8217;s climate history.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to characterize groundwater discharge, so it has been a source of uncertainty in the modeling of global cycles,&#8221; said first author Kimberley Mayfield, who led the study as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It took a large effort by researchers around the world who came together to make this happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers focused on five key elements&#8212;lithium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium&#8212;measuring concentrations and isotope ratios in coastal groundwater at 20 sites around the world, and using previously published data from additional sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those elements are important because they come from the weathering of rocks, and weathering of silicate rocks accounts for a huge uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over long time scales,&#8221; Mayfield explained.</p>
<p>Coauthor Adina Paytan, a research professor in UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences, said groundwater is an important source of inputs to the oceans, but has been easy to ignore because it is unseen and hard to measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first global assessment of groundwater discharge for most of these elements,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;This information is useful for our understanding of how weathering of rock is related to climate, not only in the present but also in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study estimated that the amount of these elements entering the sea from groundwater is at least 5%, and up to 16%, of the contributions from rivers based on the latest global groundwater flux estimates. The results also showed that the isotopic composition of groundwater discharge can be different from that of rivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The composition of groundwater discharge is very dependent on coastal geology, whereas river water is more influenced by the interiors of continents,&#8221; Mayfield said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to recognize that groundwater makes a difference globally, and now that we have this large data set, people can keep improving it with more sampling and develop better models of global groundwater discharge.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Mayfield and Paytan, the coauthors of the paper include Tristan Horner, Matt Charette, Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink, and Maureen Auro at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, as well as researchers at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany, Princeton University, Czech Geological Survey, Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research, Kiel University, U.S. Geological Survey, and the University of Hawaii, Manoa.

<p>Thorne Lay, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, was awarded the Gold Medal for Geophysics &#8220;in recognition of his outstanding work in seismological analysis, which has had an exceptional impact on our perceptions of the structure and dynamics of the Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, was awarded the Price Medal &#8220;in recognition of her outstanding multi-disciplinary contributions to earthquake mechanics, frictional behavior, and rock-fluid interactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gold Medal is the RAS&#8217;s highest honor and is often awarded as recognition of a lifetime's work. Lay&#8217;s achievements began with his Ph.D. studies of the structure of the deep mantle, which revealed a discontinuity a few hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary, implying great structural complexity with profound geodynamic consequences. This pioneering work has been the cornerstone for a diverse creative range of interdisciplinary studies in which he has been a leader, from mineral physics to the fate of subducted slabs and the potential genesis of mantle plumes.</p>
<p>Lay&#8217;s research has also provided new insights into the rupture processes of the world&#8217;s most devastating earthquakes and the generation of tsunamis. He has published hundreds of papers, inspiring generations of graduate students, post-docs, and researchers all over the world. As a leader of the seismological community, he was critical to the success of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), which archives and distributes the world&#8217;s earthquake data. He was elected chair of IRIS&#8217;s Board of Directors, has served on panels on Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Research, and was president of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth&#8217;s Interior (IASPEI).</p>
<p>The Price Medal is awarded for single investigations or a series of closely linked investigations of outstanding merit into the formation and composition of the Earth or planets. Brodsky is an internationally acknowledged leader in quantifying processes involved in generating and propagating earthquake ruptures. Her primary recent research targets have included observational approaches to measuring stress on faults, analysis of human-induced earthquakes, experimental work on granular flows at high slip rates, and analysis of aftershock distributions relative to fault ruptures and volcanic processes.</p>
<p>Using novel combinations of field measurements, laboratory experiments, observational seismology, and theoretical modeling, Brodsky&#8217;s research often provides comprehensive insights into the problems she is tackling. To test models for fault friction at the field scale, she argued that the ruptured fault should be drilled as soon as possible after an earthquake. The JFAST rapid response drilling into the seafloor disrupted by the magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake provided the required data. Her work showed that dynamic weakening in already weak clay material on the plate boundary occurred for the Tohoku rupture. Using down-hole thermal observatories, she has also detected fluid pressure redistributions in the damage zone around the main boundary faults. In announcing the Price Medal, the RAS noted that the novelty of her approaches and the importance of her work sets Brodsky apart.</p>
<p>The RAS announced the 2021 awards at the Ordinary Meeting of the Society held on Friday, January 8. The winners will be invited to collect their awards at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting in July.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted that we can recognize the wealth of talent in astronomy and geophysics through our prestigious awards and medals,&#8221; said RAS President Professor Emma Bunce. &#8220;In the midst of a challenging time, we should not lose sight of the achievements of the stars of our science community, inspiring us by answering the deep questions about the Earth beneath our feet and the Universe around us. My congratulations to all the winners!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4c3695b807270172c1b96bd91e3a741"><name>younger-lagoon-tours</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz offers virtual tours of Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve</title><summary>Prompted by the temporary suspension of in-person tours due to COVID-19, the new virtual tours are available in English and Spanish.</summary><keywords>Elizabeth Howard, Daniel Costa, Vaughan Williams</keywords><start-date>1610377200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz offers virtual tours of Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve</display-name><path>/2021/01/younger-lagoon-tours</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/younger-lagoon-tours</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1609887344954</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610381751261</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</name><display-name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>105330</file-size><width>400</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>Ernesto Chavez-Velasco</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20579</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ernesto Chavez-Velasco</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC undergraduate Ernesto Chavez-Velasco serves as the guide for virtual tours of Younger Lagoon Reserve, available in both English and Spanish.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/zoom-meeting-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/zoom-meeting-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zoom-meeting-400.jpg</name><display-name>zoom-meeting-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>87480</file-size><width>400</width><height>347</height></image><image-alt>screen shot of online meeting</image-alt><image-caption>Developing the virtual tours during the COVID-19 pandemic involved many online meetings, as shown in this screenshot.

<p>Younger Lagoon Reserve is a 72-acre natural reserve located on the UC Santa Cruz Coastal Science Campus. The reserve is part of the <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">UC Natural Reserve System</a> and serves as a living laboratory and outdoor classroom for research, teaching, and public service.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, free docent-guided tours of the reserve&#8217;s beach and lagoon area were available through the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>. Due to COVID-19 precautions, the Seymour Center was temporarily closed and the in-person tour program temporarily suspended in March 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual tour is a collaboration between the Seymour Center and the Natural Reserves as part of our efforts to maintain public access and engagement during the pandemic,&#8221; said Reserve Director Elizabeth Howard.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youngerlagoonreserve.ucsc.edu/research-teaching-public-service/visit/virtual-tour.html">virtual tours</a> are available in English or Spanish through the websites of both the Seymour Center and Younger Lagoon Reserve.</p>
<p>UCSC undergraduate Ernesto Chavez-Velasco serves as the guide for both tours. A senior majoring in environmental studies, Chavez-Velasco has done an internship at the reserve and is currently a student employee working on the reserve&#8217;s habitat restoration projects. He had just begun leading in-person tours when the pandemic shut them down in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual tours are pretty similar to the in-person tours in terms of the information about the reserve and local natural history and biodiversity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The videos take people to different places in the reserve just like the in-person tours. The biggest difference is being able to answer people&#8217;s questions when it&#8217;s in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>The virtual tour features a map of the reserve with marked locations where visitors can click to watch videos about the features of each type of habitat. Undergraduate Rose Brown Orr created the website for the tours and edited the videos as part of an internship project under the supervision of Vaughan Williams, restoration field manager for the reserve, Daniel Costa, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, and Howard. Orr, a senior in environmental studies, said her interest in the reserve and in Geographic Information System (GIS) methods made it an appealing project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thrilled to work on a project using GIS as I was planning to graduate with a concentration in GIS,&#8221; she said. &#8220;GIS offers a variety of story map templates, and we went with a user-friendly design that allows the visitor control over what part of the reserve they want to look at.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orr has done all of the work on this project remotely, including learning about the reserve itself. The experience has made her appreciate the value of remote learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to keep learning during the pandemic and use alternative methods to make that happen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad more people will be able to visit the reserve virtually now through the website.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">University of California Natural Reserve System</a> is a unique assemblage of 41 protected wild land sites throughout California. The reserves encompass nearly all of the state's major ecosystems, preserved in as undisturbed a condition as possible to support research and teaching programs. The four NRS sites that form the UC Santa Cruz unit are spread along 60 miles of the central coast: A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve, Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, Fort Ord Natural Reserve, and Younger Lagoon Reserve. The UCSC NRS also administers the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/younger-lagoon-espanol.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz ofrece giras virtuales de la Reserva Natural Laguna Younger</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4cdb5c9807270172c1b96bd14c1244a"><name>younger-lagoon-espanol</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ofrece giras virtuales de la Reserva Natural Laguna Younger</title><summary>Dada la suspensión temporal de giras en persona debido al COVID-19, las nuevas giras virtuales están disponibles en inglés y español.</summary><start-date>1610377200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz ofrece giras virtuales de la Reserva Natural Laguna Younger</display-name><path>/2021/01/younger-lagoon-espanol</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/younger-lagoon-espanol</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1609888019881</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609888172866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens, Translated by Benito Garcia</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</name><display-name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>105330</file-size><width>400</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>Ernesto Chávez-Velasco</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ernesto-chavez-velasco-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20579</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ernesto Chávez-Velasco</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>El estudiante de UCSC Ernesto Ch&#225;vez-Velasco sirve de gu&#237;a en las giras virtuales.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Dada la suspensión temporal de giras en persona debido al COVID-19, las nuevas giras virtuales están disponibles en inglés y español</article-subhead><article-text><p>Una nueva gira virtual de la <a href="https://youngerlagoonreserve.ucsc.edu/">Reserva Natural Laguna Younger</a> <span>permite a los visitantes aprender acerca la ecolog&#237;a &#250;nica y programas de la reserva desde la comodidad de sus hogares.</span></p>
<p>La Reserva de la Laguna Younger es una reserva natural de 72 acres en el Campus de Ciencia Costera de UC Santa Cruz. Es parte del <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">Sistema de Reserva Natural de la UC</a> y sirve de laboratorio viviente y aula al aire libre para investigaciones, docencia y servicio p&#250;blico.</p>
<p>Antes de la pandemia hab&#237;a giras docentes gratis de la playa y &#225;rea de laguna de la reserva disponibles mediante el <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Centro Seymour de Descubrimiento Marino</a>. Debido a las precauciones contra el COVID-19, el Centro Seymour cerr&#243; temporalmente y el programa de giras en persona se suspendi&#243; temporalmente en marzo del 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;La gira virtual es una colaboraci&#243;n del Centro Seymour y las Reservas Naturales como parte de nuestro empe&#241;o por mantener el acceso al p&#250;blico durante la pandemia&#8221;, dijo la directora de la reserva Elizabeth Howard.</p>
<p>Las giras virtuales est&#225;n disponibles en ingl&#233;s o espa&#241;ol mediante los sitios web del Centro Seymour y la Reserva Laguna Younger.</p>
<p>El estudiante de UCSC Ernesto Ch&#225;vez-Velasco sirve de gu&#237;a en ambas giras. Estudiante de cuarto a&#241;o especializ&#225;ndose en estudios ambientales, Ch&#225;vez-Velasco hizo un internado en la reserva y es actualmente un empleado-estudiante que trabaja en proyectos de restauraci&#243;n de h&#225;bitat de la reserva. &#201;l empezaba a dirigir giras en persona cuando la pandem&#237;a las cerr&#243; en marzo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Las giras virtuales son bastante similares a las giras en persona en cuanto a la informaci&#243;n acerca de la reserva, su historia y biodiversidad natural local&#8221;, dijo &#233;l. &#8220;Los videos llevan a la gente a distintos lugares de la reserva, al igual que las giras en persona. La mayor diferencia est&#225; en poder contestar las preguntas de la gente cuando se hace en persona&#8221;.</p>
<p>La gira virtual comprende un mapa de la reserva con indicaciones de d&#243;nde pueden cliquear los visitantes para ver videos sobre las caracter&#237;sticas de cada tipo de h&#225;bitat. La estudiante Rose Brown Orr cre&#243; el sitio web de las giras y edit&#243; los videos como parte de un proyecto de internado bajo la supervisi&#243;n de Vaughan Williams, gerente de campo de restauraci&#243;n en la reserva, de Daniel Costa, director del Instituto de Ciencias Marinas, y de Howard. Orr, estudiante de cuarto a&#241;o en estudios ambientales, dijo que su inter&#233;s en la reserva y en m&#233;todos del Sistema de Informaci&#243;n Geogr&#225;fica (GIS, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) lo hizo un proyecto atractivo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me encant&#243; trabajar en un proyecto usando GIS ya que estaba planeando graduarme con una concentraci&#243;n en GIS&#8221;, dijo ella. &#8220;El GIS brinda una variedad de plantillas de mapas por tema, y usamos un dise&#241;o f&#225;cil de manejar que permite al visitante controlar la parte de la reserva que quiera mirar&#8221;.</p>
<p>Todo el trabajo para este proyecto lo realiz&#243; Orr remotamente, inclusive el informarse sobre la reserva en s&#237;. Esta experiencia le sirvi&#243; para apreciar el valor de la ense&#241;anza remota.</p>
<p>&#8220;Es importante seguir aprendiendo durante la pandemia y usar m&#233;todos alternos para lograrlo&#8221;, dijo ella. &#8220;Me alegra que ahora m&#225;s gente pueda visitar la reserva mediante el sitio web&#8221;.</p>
<p>El <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">Sistema de Reserva Natural de la Universidad de California</a> es una colecci&#243;n &#250;nica de 41 sitios salvajes protegidos en distintas partes de California.

<p>The program&#8217;s Tech Development Track provides up to $5,000 in funding for student-led projects that aim to develop a solution to a significant social challenge. This year&#8217;s projects embrace that goal in innovative ways, in response to a wide range of challenges.</p>
<p>The funded projects and team members are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhancing climate change education through personalized scientific communications on phenology:</strong> a program to help citizen scientists track shifts in phenology (the timing of recurring biological events, and one of the most conspicuous fingerprints of climate change) and publicize the results to raise awareness. Team members: Yiluan Song, Ph.D., Environmental Studies; Jade Guzman, Undergrad, Environmental/Legal Studies.</li>
<li><strong>The Gateways Project:</strong> a tele-class curriculum to teach graphic design to people incarcerated in Santa Cruz County jails, and to share with other groups for wider use. Team members: Kristina Bullington, Undergrad, Sociology; Sophia Puliatti, Undergrad, Environmental Studies; Louis Beltran, Undergrad, Legal Studies; Rachel Edelman, Undergrad, Sociology.</li>
<li><strong>ReFuel &#8211; Harnessing synthetic biology to build a plastic-to-biofuel pipeline:</strong> a biomolecular system to directly recycle PET plastic waste into usable end products. Team members: Preet Kaur, Undergrad, Biomolecular Engineering/Bioinformatics; Justin Redmond, Undergrad, Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.</li>
<li><strong>Revitalizing Everett's Digital Toolkit &amp; Educational Outreach</strong>: an online toolkit for student groups at community colleges and universities who are helping non-STEM underrepresented students learn to use technology for social change. Team members: Jonathan Winston, Undergrad, Sociology; Morgan Bishop, Undergrad, Sociology; Ethan Mulberg, Undergrad, Sociology.</li>
<li><strong>weBLACK:</strong> a social media platform that seeks to explicitly take a stance on Black social issues and prioritize space for Black voices to be heard. Team members: Jonathan Scott, Ph.D., Computer Science and Engineering; Johnny Tilahun, Undergrad, Technology and Information Management; Ephrem Woldetensae, Undergrad, Business Management/Economics.</li>
<li><strong>Wonderfil at UCSC:</strong> an electric dispenser system to allow the use of reusable containers for personal care products. Team members: Shiloh Sacks, Undergrad, Electrical Engineering; Adrian Mendez, Undergrad, Computer Science.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2020-21 TSG Program also offers an <a href="https://citris.sites.ucsc.edu/tsg-student-led-events/">Events Track</a>, which is open through early June 2021 for submissions of proposals by students for diverse programming, from actual tech events, like a hackathon, to speakers addressing tech issues, to club meetings that explore some element of technology&#8217;s impact on our lives.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure the campus has what&#8217;s needed to see this vision through, the university for nearly four years has immersed itself in a long-range planning effort. The draft 2021 Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP) and accompanying draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) </span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2021/info.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lays out a framework for the campus&#8217; evolution and reflects years of collaboration with campus and community members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz of the future will continue to be an extraordinary natural environment where students, faculty, and staff teach, learn, research, live, and work. The campus of 20 years down the road will be more connected, functional and flexible, with facilities complementing the landscape &#8212; just as campus founders first imagined nearly 60 years ago. It is a place of resilience that advances innovation, inspires the next generation of leaders and innovators, and addresses society&#8217;s most challenging issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft 2021 Long-Range Development Plan supports this vision and provides current and future campus leaders with a framework for the still evolving campus. It identifies where students, staff and faculty could be housed and where spaces for learning and research could be created, while also imagining the infrastructure that connects everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has been on an unprecedented trajectory, producing transformative research and scholarship that serves society while graduating more than 120,000 students who are making their own contributions locally, regionally and globally. UC Santa Cruz joined the Association of American&#160;Universities in 2019, an astonishing achievement for a university not even 60 years old, underscoring the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching. UC Santa Cruz now shares the distinction of being the youngest member of this esteemed 65-member association and one of only four members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="lrdp-maps-700px.jpg" height="426" src="images/lrdp-maps-700px.jpg" style="border-width: 1px; float: left; margin: 10px;" width="500"/>Additionally, interest from prospective students is at record levels, the diversity of the student population is growing, and each year the campus welcomes thousands of students who are from low-income backgrounds and who will be the first in their families to earn four-year degrees. Long gone are the days when only the privileged few were able to receive the quality education that UCSC provides. For the second year in a row, UC Santa Cruz was ranked in the top-five institutions nationally for student social mobility, a value that a progressive city and state can appreciate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are focused on providing a high-quality education and research environment for the next generation of leaders while also respecting and protecting the natural environment that surrounds us, which is an important part of what makes our campus special,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This plan charts an innovative, sustainable, and exciting course for our campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a city&#8217;s general plan, a long-range development plan includes a land-use map that designates specific campus areas for different uses. The plan does not propose specific projects, and any proposed construction would need to go through a separate approval process, with some level of environmental analysis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on campus and community feedback, the draft plan:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continues to embrace and respect the original vision for the campus.&#160;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advances a compact footprint for learning, research and housing spaces.&#160;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases the campus natural reserve, used for ecological and educational purposes, while also promoting outdoor activities, health and wellness.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposes sites for up to four new residential colleges, advancing our unique and transformative residential college-system structure, which offers students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expands housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Includes housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, based on demand.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improves circulation on campus with a focus on alternative modes of transportation to reduce single-occupancy car trips.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft LRDP and its accompanying draft EIR are <a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2021/info.html">available </a></span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2021/info.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for public review. For the first time, the campus has prepared a community handbook as a guide to the draft EIR, providing the public with a summary of the full document.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments on the draft EIR can be emailed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eircomment@ucsc.edu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or mailed to:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law requires a 45-day review period, UC Santa Cruz wants to ensure the public has plenty of time to review the documents and is providing a 60-day review period for people to offer comments. The last day to provide comments is Monday, March 8, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the campus will host two online public meetings to provide an overview of the LRDP and associated draft EIR for public comment. The meetings will be</span></p>
<ul>
<li>5-7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 3</li>
<li>5-7 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 4</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Information about how to participate in the meeting can be </span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/"><span>found online</span></a><span>. All comments will be addressed in the final EIR which is expected to be released later this year. The LRDP and final EIR will then go before the UC Regents for approval, and certification, respectively.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Involving the community from the start</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz announced in 2017 that it was beginning to develop a new long-range development plan that would serve as a guide for the physical development of the campus for the next 20 years. To continue strengthening the bonds between the campus and community, UC Santa Cruz developed an extensive countywide outreach campaign to gain a wide range of perspectives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure diverse feedback throughout the plan&#8217;s development, the campus formed a </span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2040/lrdp.html#lrdp-involved"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Advisory Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, made up of leaders from local government, the education sector, and neighborhood and community groups, some of whom have challenged the university on its long-range plans in the past. UC Santa Cruz also held public-input workshops in spring 2018; conducted an online public survey and visioning activity in fall 2018; then hosted three land-use planning workshops in fall 2019, with three more presentations on the proposed land-use map in December 2019. Three scoping sessions in advance of developing the draft EIR were held in spring 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A long-term plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California policy requires each of its campuses to regularly update a long-range development plan. The exercise requires campuses to set specific parameters&#8212;a time horizon and an enrollment figure&#8212;to thoughtfully plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-range development plans are sometimes mischaracterized as enrollment growth plans, said Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham, who co-chaired the LRDP committee. In reality, decisions about enrollment are driven by many ongoing and evolving factors including student demand, state funding, and campus capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s plan will guide the campus through the next two decades and forecast what infrastructure and spaces the campus might need to serve up to 28,000 students, a figure that city and campus leaders in the 1960s had imagined the university reaching by 1990. A comprehensive plan, informed by feedback from the campus community, the general public, and the university&#8217;s large network of alumni and supporters helps current and future university leaders make good, comprehensive decisions vs. singular ones along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to fully predict university life 20 years from now,&#8221; Latham said. For example, the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown, and they may lead to changes in the campus operation, such as increased remote work for some employees and more hybrid models of instruction. &#8220;But it is prudent that our campus produces a well-thought-out roadmap that can serve as a guide regardless of what the year 2040 brings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for what the future holds and believe this plan provides us with a solid framework for continuing to fulfill the mission of our university,&#8221; Latham said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ddad7eee807270172c1b96bde1870f4e"><name>support-in-this-time-of-political-unrest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Support in this time of political unrest</title><summary>I am appalled by the reckless behavior of the rioters in our nation’s capital and the stoking of the flames of racism and mistrust in our democratic processes.

Disruption cannot have the last word on the strength of our democratic republic, and I have confidence that the will of the people will prevail. <br/><br/>Today&#8217;s mob violence was an attempt to undermine the democratic process. Free speech is a cornerstone of our democracy, while violence and rioting are an abuse of the protections and rights afforded by our First Amendment. As a university, our mission and values both support and are made possible by our strong democracy and First Amendment rights.<br/><br/>Such an egregious attack on our democratic values no doubt stirs strong emotions in all of us, myself included.

The incredible achievements we have seen in our short history have not happened by accident. Our campus sustains a clear vision for its future, and a vital part of that roadmap is our <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/long-range-development-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">draft 2021 UC Santa Cruz Long Range Development Plan</a>, released earlier today. <br/><br/>Campus leaders and planners, with wide input from campus and community groups as well as the general public, have been working for nearly four years on this draft plan, known as our LRDP. Updated regularly over our 55 years, the LRDP sketches out in broad strokes what our main campus might look like two decades from now. <br/><br/>This type of long-range foretelling is not easy, and I offer my thanks to all who have taken part in the current plan&#8217;s development. The year 2020 was a valuable reminder that the road ahead can be hard to predict and is rarely without unexpected turns. But planning efforts of this magnitude are extremely valuable. They force us to ask hard questions about where we are as a university and where we want to be. They demand that we think deeply about the current state of higher education and the direction it is heading. They require us to reaffirm our values and principles, and to explore our role as a good neighbor as well as our obligation to the residents of our state. <br/><br/>The challenging part, of course, is to translate the answers to these big questions into a land-use plan, which is what the LRDP is at its core. Think of it as a city or county general plan. It designates specific areas on campus for certain uses, such as learning spaces, dining halls, housing, recreational areas or open space. The plan does not mandate or approve growth. It simply lays out where the infrastructure to support growth might occur if it is eventually needed and funded. Every component project in the plan would need some level of environmental analysis and its own approval before any shovel is lifted. <br/><br/>These are exciting times for our campus. UC Santa Cruz joined the&#160;Association of American Universities this past academic year, an incredible achievement for a university so young, underscoring the impact and quality of our research and teaching. Demand for a UCSC education remains at record levels, the diversity of our student population is growing, and we are educating an increasing number of first-generation and low-income students. We rank among the top universities in the nation for student social mobility, which suggests we are on track in our mission to provide educational opportunity and access to all Californians. Our responsibility is figuring out how to do that &#8212; how to educate the next generation of leaders &#8212; while also protecting what makes our campus special. This plan does that, charting an innovative, sustainable, and exciting course for our campus.<br/><br/>The UCSC of 2040 will be more accessible, functional and flexible. Our footprint will remain compact, with new learning, research and housing spaces for the most part clustered in the existing academic core. New paths and street designs will make us a more accessible, less car-dependant campus. New housing will handle additional enrollment and some of the employees needed to support that enrollment. The plan affirms our commitment to our student-serving residential-college structure, envisioning additional colleges as needed, offering our undergraduates the transformative experience of a small liberal arts college with the rigor of a major research university. And all facilities will be integrated into the landscape itself, just as campus founders first imagined nearly 60 years ago, highlighting our long-standing commitment to the campus environment.<br/><br/>The draft LRDP and the accompanying draft Environmental Impact Report are <a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2021/info.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available online for review</a>. We want your feedback. We have sought it regularly over the past four years as we have prepared and planned this process. Though state law requires that we provide a 45-day review period, we are providing 60 days to ensure the public has time to thoroughly review the plan. To make understanding the LRDP easier, we have created a <a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2021/info.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community handbook</a> that gives the public a summary of the much longer draft Environmental Impact Report and technical documents. We have crafted a <a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/2040/faq.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions webpage</a> to help people understand the plan. Two online public meetings will be held next month to provide an overview of the LRDP. Public input on the plan and draft Environmental Impact Report will be accepted at the public meetings, via email at <a href="mailto:eircomment@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eircomment@ucsc.edu</a>, or by mail:<br/><br/>Erika Carpenter<br/>Senior Environmental Planner<br/>Physical Planning, Development, and Operations<br/>University of California, Santa Cruz <br/>1156 High St.<br/>Santa Cruz, CA 95064<br/><br/>The draft 2021 UC Santa Cruz Long Range Development Plan is a visual expression of our mission, detailing how we will advance it while stewarding the incredible land on which the university resides.

<p>The second-year doctoral student in psychology has worked three years with the university&#8217;s Cultivamos Excelencia program, which motivates Latinx students to complete a research university degree. A colleague described her as a true scholar-activist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can do more as an institution to really serve the students at UCSC,&#8221; Blanco said, &#8220;not only by increasing the pathway of who comes to the institution, but giving the students the proper resources to navigate the institution and really look into the strength students bring as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cultivamos Excelencia program was launched by UC Santa Cruz has part of its work as a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution. The designation, which the university received in 2015, has allowed it to receive federal grants to advance educational equity and strengthen support for Latinx students. UC Santa Cruz is one of 539 Hispanic-Serving Institutions and one of only 22 Hispanic-Serving Research Institutions.</p>
<p>As a researcher, Blanco knew that Latinx students are committed to family, so she helped create the annual Family Day event. The program brings community college students and their families to UC Santa Cruz to meet staff, faculty, learn about resources and financial aid, and what it takes to transfer to the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;I analyzed the effectiveness of that event and created reports and presentations for campus administration, which helps us institutionalize funding for Family Day for three years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Without the support of their families, many Latinx students would never attend university, Blanco said. &#8220;Some of the families had never gone to college so they didn&#8217;t know what to expect and who their students would interact with,&#8221; she said. Once they met UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty, they feel more comfortable allowing their students to attend, she said.</p>
<p>Like many of the students she serves, Blanco is the first member of her family to go to college. Born in Guerrero, Mexico, she migrated to San Diego with her family when she was 9. Her family is proud of her accomplishments, and now her younger brother is also transferring to a University of California campus.</p>
<p>Blanco hopes to eventually become a university faculty member and continue to do research to inform policies and develop resources. She also wants to continue mentoring students from minority backgrounds whose goal is to be in graduate school or engage in research.</p>
<p>Any research she works on has the goal of &#8220;creating social transformation, addressing the needs of marginalized communities and changing the various systems of oppression put in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recently got encouragement for her efforts by being selected for one of three student scholarships to attend next year&#8217;s Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institution Educators Conference. She was the only graduate student selected. The honor also came with a $1,000 cash award.</p>
<p>&#8220;They look for students who demonstrated strong commitment and ability to contribute to their schools,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel privileged to have this opportunity.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e02c0b3d807270172c1b96bd1311d109"><name>food-fund-drive</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students, staff, faculty contribute nearly 160,000 meals through Holiday Food and Fund Drive</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty contributed nearly $40,000 to the 2020 Holiday Food and Fund Drive sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board, enough to provide nearly 160,000 meals to local residents. &#13;

<p>Each year the campus collects food and financial contributions for the <a href="https://www.thefoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank</a>, founded in 1972 as the first food bank in California and second oldest in the nation. This year was particularly challenging and particularly successful given the extraordinary circumstances of a world-wide pandemic that resulted in the campus essentially emptying since March, said campus holiday food drive co-chair Nathan McCall.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a remarkable amount of donations, especially considering we didn't have the typical amount from students donating their unused meals this year,&#8221; said McCall, manager of HR Business Information Services and SAB chair-elect, in a note to donors.</p>
<h3><strong>Need doubled last year</strong></h3>
<p>The campus&#8217;s increased giving will help the Food Bank meet the increased need for food from area residents which has doubled due to COVID&#8217;s effect on our community, he said.</p>
<p>UCSC donors contributed $39,748 which translates to 158,990 meals for the drive that began just after Thanksgiving and concluded just before the holiday break. The countywide drive continues through Jan. 15 with a goal of 4.5 million meals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very grateful for the generosity shown by the UC Santa Cruz Team,&#8221; said Jan Kamman, Second Harvest corporate and community relations director.</p>
<p>McCall thanked Chancellor Cynthia Larive and John Steele, his Holiday Food and Fund Drive co-chair, for their unwavering commitment to the drive. &#8220;Cindy has been so supportive,&#8221; McCall said, noting that the chancellor plans to become more involved with the countywide drive in the coming year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been an unprecedented time of need for our entire region,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;I want to thank all of our campus affiliates for their generous contributions to the Holiday Food and Fund Drive, especially under these circumstances. Your consistent support for our neighbors is greatly appreciated. It truly was a season of giving.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong>Food barrels are gone</strong></h3>
<p>Steele, past SAB chair, has been the longtime Holiday Food Drive chair, collecting hundreds of thousands of pounds of food. &#8220;John Steele did a fantastic job being the leader for over a decade,&#8221; McCall said. Different this year was the absence of the ubiquitous blue barrels across campus where contributors could donate cans and packages. This year and in the future the focus will be on funds rather than actual food.</p>
<p>Although the barrels provided a steady reminder of the food drive, McCalll said &#8212; and the food was welcome &#8212; the Food Bank can leverage financial contributions for even more food because of its relationships with local growers, food providers, and distributors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can buy a can of beans for a dollar; the food bank can buy many pounds of beans with the same dollar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because of their huge purchasing power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Food Bank estimates it can provide four meals for every $1 donated. It sources more than 8 million pounds of food each year from farms, grocery stores, food manufacturers, distributors, and individuals, and distributes it to 100 food pantries, schools, soup kitchens, group homes, youth centers, and more, and another 100 Second Harvest program sites.</p>
<p>The Food Bank reaches 55,000 people a month. In November, it distributed more than 750,000 pounds of food to nearly 60,000 people. Almost 65 percent was distributed through non-profit partners. The rest was direct distribution to the community through the Food Bank&#8217;s nutrition programs and drive-through distribution sites in Watsonville and Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3><strong>Campus is a beneficiary</strong></h3>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz campus is also a Food Bank beneficiary. In 2019-2020, UCSC received 120,078 pounds of food from Second Harvest Food Bank including 31,683 pounds that went to Family Student Housing; 61,266 pounds distributed through Slug Support, and 27,129 pounds through the Student Union Assembly. Additionally, UCSC students and employees receive food resources from food distributions both on and off campus.</p>
<p>The Food Bank also helps UCSC students with applications to CalFresh, the state food access program for low-income residents, McCall said. The approval rate for applicants rose to 82 percent for 2019-2020 with the Food Bank&#8217;s help compared with a lower than 50 percent approval rate previously.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC

<strong>Living Writers Series</strong> at UC Santa Cruz.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Curated by Micah Perks, professor of literature and director of the Creative Writing Program, the now virtual series will run from January 14 through March 4, on Thursday nights throughout the winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span>Perks noted that this winter&#8217;s theme refers to building a world when the world seems to be falling apart, writing about&#160;place, seeking&#160;and finding (and not finding)&#160;shelter&#160;in stormy&#160;times, and what it means to be a person writing while sheltering in&#160;place.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I've been thinking about the idea of shelter, of safe places, of hunkering down, of what home means as a shelter and also as a stuck place, as captivity, claustrophobia, prison,&#8221; Perks explained. &#8220;And what role does place have in our imagination when we are spending so much time on the internet? Where is Zoom? What place is that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The series kicks off on January 14 with <strong>Sofia Samatar</strong>, author of the novels&#160;<i>A Stranger in Olondria</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>The Winged Histories</i>, the short story collection,&#160;<i>Tender</i>, and&#160;<i>Monster Portraits</i>, a collaboration with her brother, the artist Del Samatar. Her work has received numerous honors, including the World Fantasy Award. She teaches Arabic literature, African literature, and speculative fiction at James Madison University in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span>It also features a reading by <strong>Lauren Groff, </strong>the author of five books, most recently&#160;<i>Fates and Furies</i>, a novel<i>,&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Florida,&#160;</i>a short story collection. She has twice been shortlisted for the National Book Award, has won the Story Prize and France's Grand Prix de L'h&#233;ro&#239;ne, and was named one of&#160;<i>Granta's</i>&#160;Best of Young American Novelists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I'm thrilled to be bringing these particular authors as I'm a huge fan of all of their work,&#8221; said Perks. &#8220;In Lauren Groff's latest book of short stories, <i>Florida</i>, the state is a presence, a character, a thick and twisty place with heavy air. I think of her story, &#8220;Dog Go Wolf,&#8221; about two little girls abandoned on an island that is both haven and danger. Or, Sofia Samatar's&#160;<i>Monster Portraits</i>, a speculative memoir which is illustrated by her brother, a journey of imagination and memory towards a &#8216;zone of incandescence.&#8217; Or MacArthur winner Valeria Luiselli, whose two most recent books, one a novel and one nonfiction, center around the immigration crisis in the United States, around the crisis of the unsheltered looking for a place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;One thing I love about both our visiting poets, Danusha Lemeris and Tess Taylor is that though they are nationally famous, they come from our place,&#8221; Perks added. &#8220;Danusha is Santa Cruz&#8217;s Poet Laureate. Her newest book, <i>Bonfire Opera</i>, lives up to its name--it's unabashedly passionate and unafraid.&#160;Tess Taylor lives in the Bay Area and her latest books,&#160;<i>Last West </i>and<i> Rift Zone</i>, are about California present, past and future.</span></p>
<p><span>As for those </span><span>people who are looking for new things to read about these days while at home--whether for distraction, comfort, and/or to better learn how to cope with our current pandemic and understand how it's affecting them&#8212;the Living Writers Series may be just the ticket. Admission is free and open to the public with <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0odu-rqTItE9QqDMpeOhmcwkaMT5DxctOD?_x_zm_rtaid=arGtN33sRA-ixeuWQDiI8Q.1609956013242.a25e05827b8c0cfc0cdcdeb54e694d1a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=727"><strong>registration</strong></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Something remarkable has happened with our Living Writers Series in Zoom Time,&#8221; Perks noted. &#8220;We've come together, and our Zoom Living Writers is a very intimate place. While our writers read, our community fills the chat with exhortations, questions, and quotes. It has been, for many of us, a momentary place to shelter this storm.&#8221;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based magazine</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ArtReview</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently wrapped up 2020 with the release of their annual Power 100 ranking list celebrating top influencers in the contemporary art world. </span><a href="https://feralatlas.supdigital.org/index"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas: The More Than Human Anthropocene</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project curated by UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Anna Tsing, was recognized as number 15 on that list.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Power 100 has been one of the most prestigious and widely recognized rankings in the international art community for almost 20 years. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArtReview </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this year&#8217;s rankings included &#8220;a greater emphasis on the circulation of ideas and values.&#8221;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Feral Atlas </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was recognized for its impact on &#8220;global issues of political and climate justice,&#8221; along with its creative approach to these topics, which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArtReview</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> described as &#8220;playful, political and poetic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combines rigorous research from the natural and social sciences with compelling artwork and testimonials to form an interactive online experience of the Anthropocene, a geologic epoch defined by human disruption of natural systems. More than 100 contributors supported the development of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and UCSC professor Anna Tsing managed and edited the submissions, in collaboration with environmental anthropologist Alder Keleman Saxena, visual anthropologist Jennifer Deger, and architect and designer Feifei Zhou.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to see this project get recognition,&#8221; Tsing said. &#8220;The goal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to create a way to understand human-caused environmental catastrophe from across many disciplinary perspectives and diverse regional and ethnic perspectives. You can&#8217;t really understand a world condition without working from many kinds of observations.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsing said she hopes the project&#8217;s interdisciplinary nature will help thought leaders imagine new possibilities for working together on complex issues related to environmental change. Organizing the almost 80 contributed scientific field reports&#8212;along with essays, art, and video poems&#8212;was quite a task, but Tsing and her collaborators keyed in on important themes that offer insight into the Anthropocene.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, they identified &#8220;detonators,&#8221; or social forces like colonialism and capitalism that &#8220;change in a big way what can happen afterwards.&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also organized around &#8220;tippers,&#8221; or infrastructure processes like the burning of fossil fuels that &#8220;shift ecologies past tipping points.&#8221; And the project closely examines &#8220;feral qualities,&#8221; or interactions like the introduction of invasive species that demonstrate &#8220;humans and nonhumans creating problems together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any of these lenses can be used to explore</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Feral Atlas. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online viewers can also navigate via an alphabetical topic index and &#8220;reading room&#8221; of key content. There are curriculum recommendations, too, for those interested in using the project as a teaching tool. Ultimately, Tsing hopes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feral Atlas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help people understand the origins of environmental problems in a way that allows society to learn from past mistakes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like people to notice the world around them in a new way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been interested in how some of the phenomena that are rarely noticed are absolutely essential to the constitution of the world as we know it. We&#8217;ve blinded ourselves to look in just one direction, forward, because we thought that was progress. But in that process of not noticing, we&#8217;ve started eroding some of the basic conditions for living together on earth.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f24c9687807270172c1b96bd8a7976fa"><name>ritz-outstanding-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Steven Ritz receives Outstanding Faculty Award</title><summary>Physics Professor Steven Ritz has received the 2019–20 Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</summary><start-date>1610352000000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Steven Ritz receives Outstanding Faculty Award</display-name><path>/2021/01/ritz-outstanding-faculty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/ritz-outstanding-faculty</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1610382874221</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610383068130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>steve-ritz-350.jpg</name><display-name>steve-ritz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>54223</file-size><width>350</width><height>344</height></image><image-alt>Steve Ritz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17136</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Steve Ritz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Steven Ritz at the site of the Vera C.

The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve Ritz is an extraordinary individual whose leadership, research, and devotion to teaching and service have made him an invaluable member of our campus and community,&#8221; wrote Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a letter to the division announcing the award.</p>
<p>An internationally recognized scholar and scientific leader, Ritz is also known as an exceptional teacher. He served as director of the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) for the past ten years before stepping down in December, managing the institute&#8217;s involvement in a broad array of scientific initiatives.</p>
<p>Ritz first rose to prominence as a leader of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope project, which opened a new window on the high-energy universe. Since its launch in 2008, Fermi has yielded significant advances in astrophysics, including the discovery of many new pulsars and supermassive black hole systems, studies of astrophysical particle acceleration, searches for signals of dark matter particles, and tests of fundamental laws of physics. Ritz served as project scientist for Fermi at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center before joining the UCSC faculty in 2009, and he continued as deputy principal investigator for the mission's main instrument until 2013.</p>
<p>In 2013, Ritz took on a leadership role in another major collaboration as project scientist for the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, now under construction in Chile, will conduct the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), collecting vast amounts of data to address major scientific questions in astronomy, cosmology, and particle physics. The LSST Camera will be the largest digital camera ever constructed, with more than 3 billion pixels of solid-state detectors. In addition to his role as camera scientist, Ritz is also a member of the project&#8217;s science team and publication board.</p>
<p>In 2013-14, Ritz served as chair of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), appointed by the Department of Energy to establish priorities for the field of particle physics. He also serves on numerous international scientific advisory committees and was a member of several National Academies of Sciences committees.</p>
<p>Alongside his extensive research and leadership efforts, Ritz has emerged as one of the leading teachers in the Physics Department. He received a UCSC Excellence in Teaching Award in 2012. His service within the Physics Department includes participation on the department&#8217;s Committee on Diversity and Climate, for which he served as chair during the previous academic year.</p>
<p>Ritz earned his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and a recipient of the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2df6c69807270172c1b96bdfe39fbe6"><name>covid-testing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>TestMe: Keeping our community healthy, one test at a time </title><summary>The campus testing center has expanded its capacity so that it can now administer COVID-19 tests for the off-site student population, as well as for faculty and staff who live and/or work on campus or a UCSC facility.&#13;

UC Santa Cruz students living in Santa Cruz County may receive voluntary testing up to twice a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff who live and/or work on campus or a UCSC facility may also be tested up to once per week.</span></p>
<p><strong>These sites are for testing when people do not have symptoms of COVID-19. If you feel sick with symptoms of COVID-19 or have come into close contact with someone who has tested positive, you </strong><strong><i>cannot</i></strong><strong> be tested at one of our sites. If you have symptoms, call the Health Center Nurse Advice line at (831) 459-2591 (students) or your primary care physician (staff and faculty).</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information for anyone experiencing symptoms can be found in our </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 FAQs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have heard about a new, more contagious variant of COVID-19 that has been discovered recently. There is no need to be concerned that the UC Santa Cruz lab would not recognize this new version. The UC Santa Cruz testing lab can detect all known variants of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring ourselves </strong><strong><i>even when we don't have symptoms of COVID-19</i></strong><strong> is an important step in slowing the spread of the disease,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since we know that some people never have symptoms but can still transmit it, or might not have symptoms in the early stage of infection. Help our community curb COVID-19 by participating in regular testing while you feel well.</span></p>

Bee pollination, however, involves an inherent conflict of interest, because bees are only interested in pollen as a food source.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bee and the plant have different goals, so plants have evolved ways to optimize the behavior of bees to maximize the transfer of pollen between flowers,&#8221; explained Kathleen Kay, the Langenheim Professor of Plant Ecology and Evolution at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In a study <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2593">published December 23 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, Kay&#8217;s team described a pollination strategy involving flowers with two distinct sets of anthers that differ in color, size, and position. Darwin was mystified by such flowers, lamenting in a letter that he had &#8220;wasted enormous effort over them, and cannot yet get a glimpse of the meaning of the parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, the only explanation put forth for this phenomenon, called heteranthery, was that one set of anthers is specialized for attracting and feeding bees, while a less conspicuous set of anthers surreptitiously dusts them with pollen for transfer to another flower. This &#8220;division of labor&#8221; hypothesis has been tested in various species, and although it does seem to apply in a few cases, many studies have failed to confirm it.</p>
<p>The new study proposes a different explanation and shows how it works in species of wildflowers in the genus <em>Clarkia</em>. Through a variety of greenhouse and field experiments, Kay&#8217;s team showed that heteranthery in <em>Clarkia</em> is a way for flowers to gradually present their pollen to bees over multiple visits.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening is the anthers open at different times, so the plant is doling out pollen to the bees gradually,&#8221; Kay said.</p>
<p>This &#8220;pollen dosing&#8221; strategy is a way of getting the bees to move on to another flower without stopping to groom the pollen off their bodies and pack it away for delivery to their nest. Bees are highly specialized for pollen feeding, with hairs on their bodies that attract pollen electrostatically, stiff hairs on their legs for grooming, and structures for storing pollen on their legs or bodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a flower doses a bee with a ton of pollen, the bee is in pollen heaven and it will start grooming and then go off to feed its offspring without visiting another flower,&#8221; Kay said. &#8220;So plants have different mechanisms for doling out pollen gradually. In this case, the flower is hiding some anthers and gradually revealing them to pollinators, and that limits how much pollen a bee can remove in each visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are about 41 species of <em>Clarkia</em> in California, and about half of them have two types of anthers. These tend to be pollinated by specialized species of native solitary bees. Kay&#8217;s team focused on bee pollination in two species of <em>Clarkia</em>, <em>C. unguiculata</em> (elegant clarkia) and <em>C. cylindrica</em> (speckled clarkia).</p>
<p>In these and other heterantherous clarkias, an inner whorl of anthers stands erect in the center of the flower, is visually conspicuous, and matures early, releasing its pollen first. An inconspicuous outer whorl lies back against the petals until after the inner anthers have opened. The outer anthers then move toward the center of the flower and begin to release their pollen gradually. A few days later, the stigma becomes erect and sticky, ready to receive pollen from another flower.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the field, you can see flowers in different stages, and using time-lapse photography we could see the whole sequence of events in individual flowers,&#8221; Kay said.</p>
<p>The division of labor hypothesis requires both sets of anthers to be producing pollen at the same time. Kay said she decided to investigate heteranthery after observing clarkia flowers at a field site and realizing that explanation didn&#8217;t fit. &#8220;I could see some flowers where one set was active, and some where the other set was active, but no flowers where both were active at the same time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In <em>C. cylindrica</em>, the two sets of anthers produce pollen with different colors, which enabled the researchers to track where it was going. Their experiments showed that pollen from both sets of anthers was collected for food and was also being transferred between flowers, contradicting the division of labor hypothesis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The color difference was convenient, because otherwise it&#8217;s very hard to track pollen,&#8221; Kay said. &#8220;We showed that bees are collecting and transporting pollen from both kinds of anthers, so they are not specialized for different functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kay said she didn&#8217;t realize how much time Darwin had spent puzzling over heteranthery until she started studying it herself. &#8220;He figured out so many things, it&#8217;s hard to find a case where he didn&#8217;t figure it out,&#8221; she said. Darwin might have been on the right track, though. Shortly before his death, he requested seeds of <em>C. unguiculata</em> to use in experiments.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everyone else, UC Santa Cruz literature professor and Dante Alighieri expert Filippo Gianferrari has been living in a kind of limbo since the pandemic hit the United States. Some might even call it a purgatory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But isolation has given Gianferrari a chance to reflect on the renewed relevance of the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the 700th anniversary of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the epic three-part poem&#8217;s completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few months, he&#8217;s been taking strolls out of his home in the Seabright neighborhood in Santa Cruz, or venturing onto West Cliff Drive to check out the surf breaks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His in-person classes are on hold.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s tough,&#8217;&#8217; he said, while out on a walk through Santa Cruz&#8217;s Arana Gulch, a small, quiet patch of green grass and oaks with a wandering stream. &#8220;I&#8217;m really lucky to have a family with me, although sometimes, you feel like you might go crazy, with everybody in the house. I do strongly believe we&#8217;re made to be together. I&#8217;m getting literally sick from being in front of the computer. We&#8217;re natural beings. We need to move and interact. We can&#8217;t just sit there all day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a time of longing for connection, and taking stock of the way human beings have been treating each other during the pandemic, for better and worse, the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a special resonance for contemporary readers, Gianferrari said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late July,</span><a href="https://breakingground.us/stranded-on-purgatory-island/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gianferrari contributed an essay to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking Ground,</span></i> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a creative web commons dedicated to Christian social thought, that drew links between the social isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic and Dante&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purgatorio, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the second section of the three-part epic. In his essay, &#8220;Stranded on Purgatory Island,&#8221; Gianferrari urged readers to think of this tragic time as an opportunity to consider our common ground as human beings, and &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purge our past indifference and our collectively endorsed solipsism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But we do this work to embrace a new vision of ourselves, one in which we depend on others to fulfill our nature instead of our needs,&#8221; Gianferrari wrote. &#8220;Although in isolation, we share our new condition with the rest of humanity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This common path grants us an unprecedented opportunity,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;One day we may look back at the pain of this separation and call it solace. Because redemption is the most brilliant paradox of human existence: We have been given a second chance that we neither earned nor deserved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Insight into the human condition</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That intimate essay was part of Gianferrari&#8217;s wider argument that the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when taken as a whole, or in its three linked sections, provides timeless insights on what it means to be human.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We read this because we are fascinated by ourselves, not in a narcissistic way but in a curious way,&#8221; Gianferrari said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This famous poem illuminates truths about humanity, including the nature of true love and happiness, and how flawed conceptions of these things can lead to suffering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrator of the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Dante, or a construction based on Dante, a narrative persona that Dante devised to tell the story. In that sense, the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which Dante completed in 1320,&#160; is &#8220;incredibly modern,&#8217;&#8217; according to Gianferrari. It&#8217;s as if Dante wove himself into a rich tapestry that tells a story of human progress.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plot of this three-part epic poem is simple, frightening, and effective. It starts off like a thriller, with the hero in grave danger.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the very first line, the narrator is &#8220;in dark woods, the right road lost,&#8217;&#8217; scared for his life, filled with terror. He sees a leopard stalking him, &#8220;roaring with hunger.&#8217;&#8217; Then a "grim she-wolf" appears, and it seems his troubles are just beginning. Out of nowhere, the ghost of the great poet Virgil comes to the rescue. But, as Dante soon realizes, Virgil&#8217;s rescue mission will take him straight to the depths of Hell.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reader knows that the journey is going to take a turn for the worse when Dante crosses through a portal, marked with a familiar warning: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate"</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of hardening his heart to the sufferers around him, the narrator shows real compassion, a quality that connects him with modern readers. Hell is strangely bureaucratic, an endless dungeon where sinners face punishments that echo their crimes. After witnessing many ghastly sights, including a sinister boatman and a many-headed voracious dog, Dante ascends to Purgatory, and makes his way toward Paradise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dante&#8217;s views on sin, morality, and empathy become more complex. He starts off sympathizing with the souls of the damned, and admits his own vulnerability to temptation, before taking on a more judgmental view and showing resentment toward evil behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dante never abandons his human empathy, which is one reason why the poem still resonates today.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Reading Dante today&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The afterlife of Dante is all the more remarkable when we consider that the individuality of authors was not important to medieval culture. To arise from that kind of culturally sanctioned anonymity, Dante had to be a &#8220;big, bold character, someone who is in your face from the very first moment,&#8221; Gianferrari said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his bold individualism is not the only reason Dante remains relevant.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still read and commented on because this is a text that lends itself, always, to new, and renewed readings. I&#8217;ve been reading this book for years, but every time I teach it, I hear from students who pick up on some aspect of it that I&#8217;d never thought of," said Gianferrari. "You can sit around and have so much fun, with people coming from all sorts of different backgroundssitting down and discussing it. It&#8217;s just mind-blowing, the fact that everyone sees something different in the text. It creates a bond between people, and to me, that&#8217;s the reason we celebrate Dante.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fc8792f0807270172c1b96bd198885ce"><name>bernasconi-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Claude F.

Bernasconi, passed away on January 4, 2021, from complications due to COVID-19. He died peacefully surrounded by those he loved.</p>
<p>Claude was born in Z&#252;rich, Switzerland, in 1939. He received his undergraduate degree and Ph.D. (1965) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) under the direction of Prof. Zollinger. He also co-published a paper in 1965 in the prestigious <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em> based on work he carried out at Brown University with the late UCSC Prof. Joseph F. Bunnett. Following a postdoctoral appointment with Nobel Laureate Manfred Eigen at the Max-Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in G&#246;ttingen, Germany, Claude joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1967 as an assistant professor. He retired in 2014 with the status of professor emeritus.</p>
<p>As one of the founders of the department, Claude left his mark on every aspect of the developing new institution. He set the tone for excellence in research and teaching from which we all continue to benefit today. As department chair from 1976 to 1978, he was responsible and deeply involved in the hiring of the next cohort of early faculty members. Claude set an example of steady and caring leadership while emphasizing excellence in scholarly research, publishing a continuous stream of high-impact papers.</p>
<p>Claude&#8217;s remarkable research career spanned more than five decades and included contributions well beyond his particular research area. In 1976, he published the influential textbook <em>Relaxation Kinetics</em>. While his research was focused on the kinetics and mechanisms of organic reactions with emphasis on structure-reactivity questions, his rigorous approach to analyzing reaction rates contributed to many later developments in theoretical and physical organic chemistry. His discovery of the principle of non-perfect synchronization in several types of reactions&#8212;such as nucleophilic addition/substitution reactions, Fischer carbene complexes, and proton transfers reactions&#8212;are significant examples of his groundbreaking research findings.</p>
<p>Claude&#8217;s many contributions to the field of physical organic chemistry were recognized in a prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship and election as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His work at UCSC received continuous support over 5 decades from the National Science Foundation. In 2001, the department recognized his contributions and collegiality by honoring him as the first speaker in the annual Joseph F. Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture, which continues to this day as an eminent series of research presentations.</p>
<p>Claude was also recognized as a gifted, caring, and very organized teacher. His classroom lectures were recognized as masterful demonstrations of rigor, depth, and organization that were inspiring to his students and colleagues. Typical quotes from thousands of students&#8217; comments about his teaching include phrases such as, &#8220;Claude is the best&#8221; and, &#8220;His teaching is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond his work in the lab and the classroom, Claude was admired for his collegiality and for his support of the department&#8217;s and university&#8217;s activities. He chaired the Academic Senate Committee on Academic Personnel for several years. After his retirement in 2014, he continued research and interaction with the department&#8217;s faculty and students. He was also active in the UCSC Emeriti Association, chairing the Honors and Awards Committee for four years.</p>
<p>Claude is survived by his three children, Andrea, Marc, and Janette; four grandchildren, Jackson, Emmett, Martin and Isabel; his sister Silvia and niece Miriam, and wife Arlene Ramsay. He is also survived by his first wife, Regula Bernasconi-Kiss, and his second wife, Anastasia (Tessi) Kanavarioti, both of whom remained friends, attesting to his kind and caring character.</p>
<p>Claude deeply enjoyed teaching, learning, spending time with his family, and traveling. He was able to enjoy many activities in his retirement, such as becoming a student himself, taking a wide range of university classes, playing chess, and traveling around the world, which gave him great pleasure and insights into history and other cultures and lifestyles. What brought him the most pleasure was being surrounded by his family, especially his grandchildren.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Ilan Benjamin, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fcc009f6807270172c1b96bd77a06b31"><name>osterbrock-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC’s Osterbrock Leadership Program goes national</title><summary>The National Osterbrock Leadership Program provides experiences and opportunities for astronomy graduate students to develop leadership and management skills.</summary><start-date>1610560800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC’s Osterbrock Leadership Program goes national</display-name><path>/2021/01/osterbrock-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/osterbrock-program</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1610558212566</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610579310894</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rick Fienberg (AAS)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/olp-group-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/olp-group-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olp-group-450.jpg</name><display-name>olp-group-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>103068</file-size><width>450</width><height>272</height></image><image-alt>Osterbrock program participants</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/olp-group-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/olp-group-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olp-group-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>olp-group-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18949</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Osterbrock program participants</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC&#8217;s Osterbrock Leadership Program has been training future leaders in the astronomical sciences for the past six years.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/osterbrocks-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/osterbrocks-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>osterbrocks-375.jpg</name><display-name>osterbrocks-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>71142</file-size><width>375</width><height>275</height></image><image-alt>Irene and Donald Osterbrock</image-alt><image-caption>Irene and Donald Osterbrock</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The National Osterbrock Leadership Program provides experiences and opportunities for astronomy graduate students to develop leadership and management skills</article-subhead><article-text><p>Graduate education in the physical sciences usually does well at turning out people who can conduct research, write papers, and teach classes. But university departments rarely do much to prepare students for some of the other activities they will likely undertake throughout their careers. When asked to chair a committee, organize a conference, or manage a laboratory, young scientists often have to figure it out as they go.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/Osterbrock/index.html">Donald and Irene Osterbrock Leadership Program</a> has been training future leaders in the astronomical sciences for the past six years. Now, a partnership between UCSC&#8217;s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the American Astronomical Society (AAS) is expanding its reach. Thanks to a gift to AAS that provides matching grants, graduate students in astronomy at UC Irvine and Columbia University will have opportunities to get real-world training in scientific leadership and management while earning their doctorates.</p>
<p>Columbia and UC Irvine submitted successful proposals to the <a href="https://aas.org/education/national-osterbrock-leadership-program">National Osterbrock Leadership Program</a>. Funded by a generous gift from the Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation, this new national program provides up to $40,000 annually in total matching funds and is jointly administered by the AAS and UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NOLP is a game changer,&#8221; said Robert Williams, former director of the Space Telescope Science Institute and a member of UCSC&#8217;s OLP Mentors Circle. &#8220;It will provide graduate students the opportunity to develop leadership skills early in their careers in projects that have a real and positive impact on science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Columbia&#8217;s proposal, entitled &#8220;Inclusive Leadership for Astronomy&#8217;s Future,&#8221; is spearheaded by Professor David J. Helfand, past chair of the Department of Astronomy and past president of the AAS. Columbia plans to train two cohorts of five fellows each&#8212;one group during the first two years, and the second group during the subsequent two years.</p>
<p>Among the major features of the program, the fellows will participate in a series of workshops on management skills, ethical leadership, conflict resolution, and oral and written communication skills useful for addressing different audiences such as scientists, the public, and policy makers. These workshops will be designed around cultivating an inclusive leadership style that equips fellows to navigate and lead the diverse workforce of the future. In order to put into practice the leadership skills they&#8217;re acquiring, each fellow will write a proposal to develop a product or activity that they will lead during the tenure of their fellowship.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we&#8217;ve occasionally run bits and pieces of this program in the past, the NOLP provides us with the opportunity to bring in colleagues from Columbia&#8217;s leading business, law, and education schools,&#8221; Helfand said. &#8220;It also will enable us to bring in alumni who hold leadership positions in the private sector, to offer a comprehensive program that will prepare our graduates for leadership roles in our field.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCI&#8217;s proposal, &#8220;Physics &amp; Astronomy Community Excellence (PACE),&#8221; is led by Stephanie Sallum, assistant professor of physics and astronomy. It will train 16 fellows in decision-making, team management, content development, active listening, and professional communication through a program focused on effective peer mentoring. This will leverage resources already in place at UCI, which recently launched a program that pairs senior graduate students with first-year students to provide mentoring in areas such as time and goal management, finding and fostering healthy relationships with advisors, preparing for the qualifying exam, and exploring various career paths.</p>
<p>As part of their leadership training, the UCI fellows will earn a certificate in mentorship excellence from the UCI Graduate Division and then help manage the peer-mentoring program, advise other mentors, and organize workshops for mentors, mentees, and their faculty advisors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are so excited to have been selected as a NOLP node,&#8221; Sallum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a nice validation of the peer mentoring program created by our graduate students. The NOLP will help make peer mentoring at UCI more sustainable, and it will enable us to include mentorship from leaders in the field. I can&#8217;t wait to see its impact on the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Columbia and UCI aim to develop curricula and other materials based on their pilot programs to encourage and facilitate the creation of similar programs at other institutions. Like the National Osterbrock Leadership Program itself, they will help meet the goal of making leadership and management training the rule, rather than the exception, for graduate programs in the astronomical sciences.</p>
<p>AAS President Paula Szkody (University of Washington) said, &#8220;The AAS hopes to expand the NOLP to more institutions based on the outcomes of the current pilot program and on successful future funding efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Osterbrock Leadership Program is named for Donald E. Osterbrock (1924-2007), eminent professor of astronomy at UCSC and a former director of Lick Observatory, and his wife Irene Hansen Osterbrock (1926-2019), who helped establish the UCSC Library&#8217;s Mary Lea Shane Archives at Lick Observatory as a world-renowned repository of US astronomical history. Don Osterbrock received the AAS&#8217;s highest honor, the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, in 1991, and Irene was named a Patron of the AAS in 2011.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fcff373c807270172c1b96bd554b8a4e"><name>flanagan-acm-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer scientist Cormac Flanagan elected ACM Fellow</title><summary>Cormac Flanagan, professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world's leading computing society.</summary><start-date>1610524800000</start-date><display-name>Computer scientist Cormac Flanagan elected ACM Fellow</display-name><path>/2021/01/flanagan-acm-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/flanagan-acm-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1610562352927</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610562510742</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/cormac-flanagan-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/cormac-flanagan-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cormac-flanagan-300.jpg</name><display-name>cormac-flanagan-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>61996</file-size><width>300</width><height>346</height></image><image-alt>Cormac Flanagan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/cormac-flanagan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/cormac-flanagan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cormac-flanagan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cormac-flanagan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13411</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cormac Flanagan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cormac Flanagan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Cormac Flanagan, professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a fellow of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), the world's leading computing society.</p>
<p>Flanagan was recognized &#8220;for contributions to static and dynamic program debugging and verification methods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flanagan leads the the Software and Languages Research Group in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. His research interests include programming languages, computer security, concurrency, verification, type systems, and dynamic and static program analysis.</p>

<p>Flanagan&#8217;s publications have received numerous &#8220;best paper&#8221; and &#8220;distinguished paper&#8221; awards. He was awarded a prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 2005 and a UCSC Excellence in Teaching Award in 2015.</p>
<p>The ACM Fellows program recognizes the top 1% of ACM Members for their outstanding accomplishments in computing and information technology and outstanding service to ACM and the larger computing community. Fellows are nominated by their peers, with nominations reviewed by a distinguished selection committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year our task in selecting the 2020 Fellows was a little more challenging, as we had a record number of nominations from around the world,&#8221; explained ACM President Gabriele Kotsis. &#8220;The 2020 ACM Fellows have demonstrated excellence across many disciplines of computing. These men and women have made pivotal contributions to technologies that are transforming whole industries, as well as our personal lives. We fully expect that these new ACM Fellows will continue in the vanguard in their respective fields.&#8221;</p>

to first 1,200 students to sign up for the program</article-subhead><article-text><p><span>Following the success of last year&#8217;s <strong><i>Deep Read</i></strong> with guest author Margaret Atwood, The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz has announced the second installment of its new program that invites the campus and community to think deeply about literature, art, and the most pressing issues of the day.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the program is to read books from a wide variety of genres and explore their implications on our politics, inner lives, and communities. Driven by our rapidly changing and tumultuous times, The Deep Read is designed to be a new platform for intellectual engagement, classes, and major events with top writers and thinkers.</span></p>
<p><span>The Deep Read book selected for 2021 is Tommy Orange&#8217;s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel <i>There There</i>, a multi-generational, fast-paced story about the lives of urban Native Americans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>One of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&#8217;s 10 Best Books of the Year, <i>There There</i> was long-listed for the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. It additionally received the Center for Fiction&#8217;s First Novel Prize and the Pen/Hemingway Award.</span></p>
<p><span>Born and raised in Oakland, California, Orange is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. He is a graduate of the M.F.A .program at the Institute of American Indian Arts, and was a 2014 MacDowell Fellow and a 2016 Writing by Writers Fellow.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To kick off this year&#8217;s Deep Read</strong>, The Humanities Institute (THI) is offering free copies of Orange&#8217;s <i>There There </i>to the first 1,200 students to sign up for The Deep Read, and another 200 books to the first Deep Readers across the country who sign up as well.</span></p>
<p><span>The program includes weekly emails about different aspects of the book to help deepen the reading experience, guided by UC Santa Cruz professors in the Humanities and Social Sciences, to explore it through the lenses of anthropology, literature, history, indigenous studies, and feminist studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Participants will also be able to join the conversation in a series of online salons, where professors will discuss the book with UCSC students and the broader Deep Read community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>This quarter, Porter College is also offering a course in conjunction with the <a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/honors-programs/college-scholars/index.html">College Scholars Program</a> titled &#8220;Tommy Orange, <i>There There</i>, and the New Native Renaissance.&#8221; Students in the class will study how the power of collective storytelling and community activism is depicted in the struggle against the marginalization of Native life, the exploitation of Native lands, the continued erasure of Native experience from the historical record, and the legacies of genocide and occupation.</span></p>
<p><span>The 2021 Deep Read will culminate in a special live virtual event with author Tommy Orange on March 3, 2021.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Given the increase in campus cases, as well as COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations rates in Santa Cruz County and throughout the state, we have postponed the move-in scheduled to take place this weekend and have shifted to a rolling move-in process that is contingent on many factors. Students have been contacted directly by the housing office with more specific information. We have asked students not to relocate into the Santa Cruz community until their planned on-campus housing is available. We continue to provide housing for about 900 students who moved into campus housing at the start of the academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We recognize the disappointment and disruption students are facing, and we are working to support students, wherever they are living. As conditions improve and we are able to welcome additional students in campus housing that maintains the health and well-being of our campus community, we will do so. We are actively monitoring the public health of our campus, community, and state.</span></p>

Students living on campus or accessing university&#160; sites are required to be tested twice a week. Students living off-campus and not accessing university sites can voluntarily be tested up to twice a week. Employees are eligible to get tested up to once a week. More information is available on our </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610755898631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvppU9xnBCt25_12bw8_lnDoXjsg" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testing site</span></a><span>. We encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity to be tested regularly.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Vaccination planning&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>COVID-19 vaccination planning and rollout is also underway. The state has issued a</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/%23When-can-I-get-vaccinated&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610755898631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh4i4HdbyIV_mdk1nMPHF-89rqvg" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/#When-can-I-get-vaccinated" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>multi-phase vaccine rollout plan</span></a><span>. The situation is evolving rapidly, and some of the elements of the phases could change quickly.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At this point, the UC system is in Phase 1A of vaccine rollout, which is focused on health-care workers. Work is underway to develop the process for vaccine distribution for </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/%23When-can-I-get-vaccinated&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610755898631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh4i4HdbyIV_mdk1nMPHF-89rqvg" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/#When-can-I-get-vaccinated" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phase 1B</span></a><span>. As the overarching goal is to get vaccines rolled out across the state and system as quickly as possible, it is likely that individuals will have the ability to get the vaccine through their health-care providers as rollout continues. If an alternative route to vaccination becomes available to you, we encourage you to take advantage of that opportunity.

<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to vaccine rollout, discussions are underway at the system-level to identify what COVID-19 vaccine policies will be needed. At this point, the only </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucop.edu/uc-health/_files/covid-19-vaccine-policy.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610755898631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcofKFRutF1BjoyuW34FpntgESYg" href="https://ucop.edu/uc-health/_files/covid-19-vaccine-policy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>UC COVID-19 vaccine policy</span></a><span> that has been issued by the UC system pertains to individuals working in health-care settings. As additional policies and requirements roll out, we will communicate with the campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are in a very challenging stage of the pandemic with high case counts across our state. However, with vaccine rollout broadening there is reason for hope moving forward.

<p><span>Born in Scotland, Buck spent his childhood in the royal burgh of Dumbarton; his family came to Oakland, California in 1955. He attended Berkeley, receiving his B.A. in 1964 as he discovered almost by accident the joys of historical research. He then studied at the University of Illinois, Champaign, earning an M.A., 1965, then returned to UC Berkeley to complete his Ph.D. in 1971, pursuing his study of Tudor/Stuart England. He arrived at Santa Cruz in 1970, joined the Board of Studies in History, and served UC Santa Cruz for forty years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Buck was admired, and loved, by colleagues and students, and he was a good friend to many. He was a generous citizen of the campus community, and he built a reputation for fairness, integrity, and good judgment along with his ability to keep calm and carry on, whatever the crisis du jour; he was frequently asked to assumed major administrative responsibilities in the history department, the colleges, the Humanities Division, and the campus. He was a founding member of College V (Porter), later an active fellow of Stevenson. He twice served as department chair and shepherded the reinvention of the graduate program in history. He particularly enjoyed serving on the editorial board of the University of California Press, which benefited from his extensive and wide-ranging knowledge. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Buck taught an extensive range of courses, including early modern Europe, the Dutch republic, Scotland, and even California. His primary teaching grew out of his absorbing, and rich research in Tudor/Stuart England, always speaking in his rolling Scottish burr. A social historian whose work faced towards the people so seldom noticed, he had found in the archives traces of popular dissatisfaction and resistance. He pulled the uninterested students into these worlds of the past by designing classes on Scottish history through the novel or posing key historical problems to solve, such as who killed the princes in the tower (spoiler alert: not Richard III). He lectured easily and fluidly without notes, introducing students to kings and queens, bishops and revolutionaries as well as weavers and miners, all ordinary people. It was, noted one student, &#8220;like being taught history by a brilliant Sean Connery.&#8221; Fascinated by agriculture and the farmers in the countryside, he emphasized the nitty-gritty of living in desperate times. He convinced students of the importance of food and production to the historical record, pointing to the law requiring every baker to produce a loaf affordable to the poor, the farthing loaf. Failure to do so resulted in riots. He fought against Friday afternoon desertions with stories about filthy water and the necessary consumption of beer, reporting that Henry&#8217;s court consumed 100,000 barrels per year. (For those who couldn&#8217;t do the math, 275 barrels per day.) While some professors fought absences with tests and assignments, Professor Sharp withheld tales of beer.</span></p>
<p><span>The bookends of his research are volumes focused upon food, poverty, and popular resistance. He challenged assumptions that people leading riots were working under the direction of the gentry, arguing instead that their actions represented the efforts of independent agents working for themselves and their own community. The final volume pushed this possibility further chronologically, tracking activities from the mid-13</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> to the mid-17</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> century, arguing that popular responses to grain shortages led the monarch and the cities to regulate the market. In this work Buck engaged one of the central problems driving early modern western history, the moral economy&#8212;offering not only an alternative vision, but an extensive, 400-year archival trail asking provocative questions and providing significant alternative interpretations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160; &#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Buck was an accomplished outdoorsman; he enjoyed camping, hunting, and fly fishing, always ready to bring his chainsaw and axe to help his friends. He enjoyed music and theater, especially Shakespeare&#8217;s history plays, upon which he was a public lecturer as well as a fan. He would provide insightful commentary on the nature of the plays and the customs and traditions illuminated. He even published an essay on <i>Coriolanus</i>, adding something new to the body of Shakespeare scholarship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>When adjusted for the size of the Monterey Bay regional economy, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s economic impact is second only to UC Davis in the Sacramento/Tahoe region and ahead of UC Santa Barbara in what is defined as the Central Coast of California.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/economic-impact-report-2021.pdf">&#8220;Economic, Fiscal and Social Impact Analysis,&#8221;</a> was commissioned by the UC Office of the President and prepared by Beacon Economics, an independent research and consulting firm based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Beacon Economics found that the University of California contributes roughly $82 billion annually to California&#8217;s economic output. More than a half-million jobs in California &#8212; or one in every 45 &#8212; are supported by the University, and UC-related spending generates nearly $12 billion annually in federal, state and local tax revenues.</p>
<p>The report underscores how the university creates fertile ground for entrepreneurship and innovation that serves the entire region, said Chancellor Cynthia Larive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This comprehensive report very clearly shows the broad and deep contributions that UC Santa Cruz brings to the community that we are proud to be a part of,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;Our campus creates an economic foundation that supports long-standing industries as well as emergent ones. We want our region to enjoy long-term innovation that offers compelling reasons for the area&#8217;s children to remain here for their adult lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the greater Monterey Bay area, identified as the local economic region for UC Santa Cruz, the study found that 18,021 jobs can be directly linked to the campus, generating labor income of $892.5 million. This includes direct full-and part-time jobs on and off campus held by faculty, staff, and students. It also includes indirect jobs in the community not part of UC&#8217;s payroll but that are created because of UCSC&#8217;s presence. The campus accounts for another roughly 1,200 jobs in other parts of the state.</p>
<p>Of the 18,021 regional jobs that the campus generates, as of April 2020, 8,266 were directly related to campus operations, including 2,928 academic and 5,338 staff positions, which include 2,562 student staff.</p>
<p>This report quantifies UC&#8217;s economic and fiscal contributions to California, revealing the high return on investment to California from state and federal funds. UC Santa Cruz is responsible for contributing $190 million in federal tax revenue and $131.4 million in state and local taxes for the region.</p>
<p>In total, UC Santa Cruz added $1.35 billion in value to the region&#8217;s economy and helped create more than $2 billion in economic activity, Beacon Economics concludes.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC&#8217;s economic ripple effect is so large that it touches every region in the state, including those without a campus or medical center,&#8221; said UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D. &#8220;Beyond economic impact, the University&#8217;s contributions in health, innovation and social equity are even more important to the lives of Californians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Beacon Economics study looked at the university&#8217;s impacts on society including the effects of higher incomes that the university&#8217;s graduates receive. Social impacts include UC&#8217;s role in enhancing human capital, research and innovation (such as how investment in UC research has leveraged the founding of 1,239 startups by UC alumni to date), fostering economic growth and community development, and improving health care outcomes for millions across the state.</p>
<p>The economic impact study reaffirmed that UC is a world leader in innovation, averaging five<br/>inventions every day. In fiscal year 2019, UC received over 500 patents, bringing the University&#8217;s total to over 5,000 active U.S. patents and nearly 6,000 foreign patents. This reputation for excellence attracted nearly $6 billion in federal, state and private research awards to the University in fiscal year 2019 alone.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz attracted $189.8 million in research funding for the year that ended June 30, 2020, an all-time high and a 14.4 percent increase over the previous year, according to a soon-to-be-published annual report by the UCSC Office of Research. Sixty five percent of research grants came from the federal government. In the same period, campus researchers were awarded 20 patents and applied for 31. UCSC currently has 154 active patents.</p>
<p>The University of California is the state&#8217;s third-largest employer (behind only the state and federal governments), directly employing about 228,824 full- and part-time faculty and staff as of April 2020. UC&#8217;s budget, $37.2 billion in fiscal year 2018-19, supports its mission to uphold a gold standard in teaching, research, public service, and fostering economic growth throughout California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-s-economic-impact-california-hits-new-high-82b-annually</url><title>UC’s economic impact on California hits new high of $82B annually</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/economic-impact-report-2021-fact-sheet.pdf</url><title>Factsheet: UC's economic impact on California</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d53fbcf807270172c1b96bd5b90b6e6"><name>support-resources-during-fires-power-outages</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Support resources during fires, power outages</title><summary>Many of us have been anxious today as Cal Fire battles several wildfires in our region.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, two faculty members from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Environmental Studies Department won a $496,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to support innovations in sustainable aquaculture. The funding will help principal investigator Pallab Sarker, an associate research professor and sustainable aquaculture and fish nutrition expert, and co-principal investigator professor Anne Kapuscinski, a sustainability science and policy expert, in their efforts to develop a new ocean-friendly feed formula for farm-raised rainbow trout.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hope to use proteins and oils derived from a combination of marine microalgae to replace traditional fishmeal and fish oil ingredients sourced from wild-caught forage fish like anchovies, sardines, and herring. Currently, the aquaculture industry&#8217;s demand for forage fish, in the form of fishmeal and fish oil, diverts these fish away from providing natural food resources for wild animals within ocean food webs. That&#8217;s why the research team wants to help &#8220;uncouple&#8221; aquaculture from ocean food webs by improving fish-free feed options: formulations that don&#8217;t rely on ingredients from wild fish.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker and Kapuscinski published a&#160;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/fish-free-feed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breakthrough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this front in November. They developed a new, potentially cost-effective feed formula for farmed tilapia that fully replaces fish-based ingredients with a combination of microalgea while providing<span>&#160;better fish weight gain and higher nutritional value in the filet for humans</span>. Now, the researchers are hoping to replicate their success with rainbow trout. That goal is especially important since trout and their relatives, salmon, are some of aquaculture&#8217;s largest consumers of fishmeal and fish oil.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike tilapia, trout and salmon are natural predators that evolved to eat other fish. Marine microalgae are much lower down in the ocean food chain, however, they&#8217;re still part of the same systems of nutrient and energy transfer. That gives researchers hope that the right combination of microalgae species could potentially match the nutritional value of fish-based ingredients. Sarker and Kapuscinski's experiments will be aimed at finding the right fit for the needs of rainbow trout.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know it will be harder to achieve a cost-viable diet that has no fish ingredients than it was for tilapia,&#8221; said Kapuscinski. &#8220;We won the grant because we have promising ideas with microalgae to make a big advance. Even if we don&#8217;t achieve a fully fish-free diet for farmed trout, achieving further reduction in the use of fishmeal and fish oil would be a big accomplishment. And that could serve as a model for salmon farming, too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new USDA funding for this project will complement a prior award of $120,000 from </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/sarker-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Sea Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Together, these grants will allow researchers to expand the scope and timeline of their experiments. In particular, Sarker said he&#8217;s excited that the new funding will allow him to test out a microalgal species he hasn&#8217;t worked with before. It&#8217;s a variety that is now being produced commercially for use in omega-3 dietary supplements, so the team will plan to utilize the protein-rich algal biomass leftover after the omega-3 oils have been extracted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers expect to start experimenting soon with various processing methods for manufacturing feed using these and other ingredients. They&#8217;ll also test the digestibility of their formulas. Of course, this will require some eager participants to chow down on the new feed, so juvenile rainbow trout will be stocked into the team&#8217;s newly-constructed recirculating aquaculture facility at the UCSC Farm. These will be the first fish to take up residence in the new facility. Their arrival will be a big moment for researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have been facing unprecedented challenges this year with the COVID-19 lockdowns and then the California fires, all of which has seriously affected our project timelines,&#8221; said Sarker. &#8220;Now, our recirculating aquaculture system has been prepared to get live rainbow trout for our first experiment in our new lab, and I&#8217;m truly thrilled about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker said he also looks forward to involving UC Santa Cruz students in the lab&#8217;s research, once it&#8217;s safe to do so. Currently, social distancing protocols limit the number of people who can be in the lab at a given time, but in the future, Sarker hopes to bring students to visit the facility, where they could gain practical experience with collecting research data and caring for fish.&#160;</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="tanks and pipes are assembled inside the team's new research facility" class="" height="375" src="images/aquaculture_inside-500.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="500"/>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can also learn about the lab&#8217;s sustainability practices. Kapuscinski said the facility&#8217;s location at the UCSC Farm was carefully selected to model how aquaculture and agriculture can be integrated to reduce waste. Water periodically removed from the recirculating aquaculture tanks contains beneficial nutrients for plants and will be used as irrigation and fertilizer for the organic farm managed by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new facility up and running and new grant funding in hand, the research team members say they are feeling optimistic about the road ahead.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am delighted to conduct this line of research at UCSC,&#8221; Sarker said. &#8220;This is a tremendous opportunity for our society to shift away from unsustainable practices to sustainable aquaculture production. I think we can do better. We have an obligation to do better for our planet.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="217bf603807270172c1b96bdaad1665b"><name>women-of-the-year</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Italian newspaper ranks sociology professor among top women of the year </title><summary>Camilla Hawthorne is being recognized for shedding light on emergent Afro-Italian identities and activism during a time of racial reckoning in Italy and beyond.  </summary><start-date>1611129600000</start-date><display-name>Top Women Of The Year</display-name><path>/2021/01/women-of-the-year</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/women-of-the-year</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1611174508005</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612208419203</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>black-history</value><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/camilla-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/camilla-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>camilla-350.jpg</name><display-name>camilla-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>94565</file-size><width>350</width><height>516</height></image><image-alt>Camilla Hawthorne sitting on the steps in front of a garden</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/camilla-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/camilla-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>camilla-80.jpg</name><display-name>camilla-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25170</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Camilla Hawthorne sitting on the steps in front of a garden</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne has been traveling between California and Italy since she was a child, and her research requires her to stay deeply connected to political developments happening on the ground in Italy.&#160;Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Camilla Hawthorne is being recognized for shedding light on emergent Afro-Italian identities and activism during a time of racial reckoning in Italy and beyond
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy&#8217;s most widely read newspaper, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corriere della Sera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released its year-end list of the world&#8217;s <a href="https://www.corriere.it/speciale/cronache/2020/donne-anno-2020/">top women of 2020</a>, and UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of sociology Camilla Hawthorne made the list at number 20 for her highly influential research into the Black diaspora across Italy and the Mediterranean.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a refugee crisis and economic disparities fuel immigration to the Mediterranean from Africa, Hawthorne has shed light on emergent Afro-Italian identities and the activism of Italian-born children of immigrants who are fighting to reform the country&#8217;s restrictive citizenship laws. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corriere della Sera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> praised her work as an insightful &#8220;reflection on space,&#8221; which documents the ways in which Black geographies transcend national borders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne, the daughter of an Italian mother and an African American father, has been traveling between California and Italy since she was a child, and her research requires her to stay deeply connected to political developments happening on the ground in Italy. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, she&#8217;s had to curtail her usual travels. The recognition from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corriere della Sera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came at the perfect time to lift Hawthorne&#8217;s spirits with a reminder that she is an important part of the community, even from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really grateful to have this recognition that my work is having an impact in Italy, and I hope that it's one way of keeping that connection alive,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Hawthorne has still been keeping close tabs on current events in Italy, particularly the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted over the summer. She said this movement showed how Afro-Italian activists have been addressing the very specific forms of racism that arise from Italy&#8217;s history while also connecting their efforts with struggles taking place around the globe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were thousands of activists pouring into the streets across Italy in these efforts led by Black Italians,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were both expressing solidarity with the United States and translating this to the Italian context as a way to think about the ways that Black youth are disenfranchised and the ways that Black migrant laborers are exploited in the agricultural fields of Southern Italy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne has been studying Black Italian political mobilizations for almost a decade and is currently wrapping up a major manuscript documenting her findings. She also worked with an international research collective on a book coming out this spring that will explore the larger human geography of the Black Mediterranean and trace the trends driving the region&#8217;s refugee crisis. The history of migration from Africa to the Mediterranean is fraught with border fortification and other forms of anti-immigrant violence, Hawthorne says, and colonialism also shapes &#8220;both the repertoires of racism and the modalities of resistance&#8221; within these countries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hopes that scholars and activists based in the United States who read her work will recognize the importance of how social and political forces at work in the Mediterranean also manifest themselves much closer to home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Italy shows us in very, very vivid ways how racism and border violence and colonialism are all deeply interconnected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of the most powerful things the Black Mediterranean shows us is that any mobilization for racial justice, and any mobilization to defend Black lives, has to take justice for immigrants seriously, and it has to take colonialism seriously.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

cover of Mapplethorpe and the Flower </image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The late American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe first gained international attention due to his now infamous exhibition, <i>The Perfect Moment</i> (1988&#8211;90), which was initially held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Although the exhibition included classic portraits and floral studies, it was the S&amp;M images that drew the greatest response, leading to claims that they were too offensive for public viewing and a subsequent campaign, spearheaded by North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, to ban government funding of &#8220;indecent&#8221; images.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Over the years, significant critical attention has been paid to those images and the artist&#8217;s reputation as a provocateur and sexual renegade. But a new book by UC Santa Cruz history of art and visual culture professor Derek Conrad Murray, <i>Mapplethorpe and the Flower: Radical Sexuality and the Limits of Control, </i>offers the first dedicated book-length critical study of Mapplethorpe's lesser-known still life flower photographs.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The book is an interdisciplinary investigation into the symbolism of the flower as envisioned by a photographer whose production was mired in controversy, in large part due to his thematic exploration of radical sexuality and queer subcultural life,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;In many respects, the tensions surrounding the artist&#8217;s life and work overshadowed the complex symbolism of his flower photographs, which were often regarded as conceptually distinct from his more notorious images. <i>Mapplethorpe and the Flower</i> argues that the flower synthesizes the artist&#8217;s interconnected concerns with beauty, sexuality, repression and ultimately death.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There is a general scholarly and critical consensus that Mapplethorpe&#8217;s flower photographs were a concession, or a capitulation on the part of the artist to market forces&#8212;in other words, saleable objects for uptight collectors,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The book shows<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>that such assessments are both careless and ultimately incorrect. It was within the flower photographs that Mapplethorpe was able to illustrate his historical acumen and sophistication as an image maker and symbolist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Murray explained why he decided to focus on this particular topic</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Art history and visual studies have not yet adequately attended to the complexities of difference&#8212;in terms of race, gender and sexuality&#8212; both historically and in the present,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;For me Mapplethorpe&#8217;s flowers have something very important to say about visual culture that is especially pertinent to our current moment. The artist straddled the line between social acceptance and marginalization&#8212;a status he embraced.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;But what truly motivated this study was the fact that Mapplethorpe had a huge impact on the development of visual culture, contemporary art, and particularly black art.&#8221; Murray added. &#8220;Mapplethorpe&#8217;s photographs of African-American men generated such ire among the black intelligentsia&#8212;especially by black queer artists and intellectuals&#8212;that it inspired an entire generation of artists, and a vibrant critical discourse, that was aggressively engaged in a project of self-representation and image resuscitation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Murray&#8217;s research focuses</strong> on the junctures of African-American and African diasporic art, post-black art and aesthetics, cultural theory, identity, and&#160;representation. He&#160;has contributed to leading magazines and journals of contemporary art and visual culture, including </span><span><i>American Art</i></span><span>,&#160;</span><span><i>Art in America</i></span><span>,&#160;</span><span><i>Art Journal</i></span><span>,</span><span><i>&#160;Third Text</i></span><span>, and&#160;</span><span><i>Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art</i></span><span>, where he is associate editor.</span></p>
<p><span>Murray is also the author of the book,&#160;</span><span><i>Queering Post-Black Art: Artists Transforming African-American Identity After Civil Rights</i></span><span>&#160;He has served on the editorial board of&#160;<i>Art Journa</i>l (CAA) and is currently co-editor of<i>&#160;</i><i>Visual Studies</i>;&#160;the official journal of the&#160;International Visual Sociology Association.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b31af56807270172c1b96bd6306d3ab"><name>ucsc-zoom-live-transcription</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Zoom Live Transcription</title><summary>We are excited to share that the option for live transcription is now available through your UCSC Zoom account.

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom for Instruction</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Some instructors may wish to allow students to save the transcript as a supplement for taking notes. Others may wish to disable this function in order to prevent their own and their students&#8217; words being easily downloaded and shared. For events such as invited speakers, ask the speaker in advance to determine whether the transcript can be saved. It is recommended that if you are allowing the transcript to be downloaded after a meeting, that you inform meeting participants about this, as you do when recording.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Accuracy of the transcription depends on audio input from the speaker, including the speaker's accent, voice modulation, intonation and the quality of the microphone used.</span></p>

The program, called &#8220;<a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/scientists-saving-the-oceans/">Scientists Saving the Oceans</a>,&#8221; is part of the Seymour Center&#8217;s efforts to provide distance learning activities for the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The first expedition, &#8220;Protecting Dolphins and Whales from Oceanic Noise,&#8221; will take participants behind the scenes with researchers in the Marine Mammal Physiology Project headed by Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and director of research initiatives at the Seymour Center.</p>
<p>Facilitated live through Zoom, the expedition consists of six engaging 90-minute classes. Each class session includes live-streaming time with staff and resident animals at Long Marine Laboratory. The classes begin February 8 and are limited to 20 participants. Registration form and additional details are <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/scientists-saving-the-oceans/">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Participants in the virtual expedition will get to interact with Long Marine Lab&#8217;s expert animal trainers and researchers to learn how they care for dolphins and seals and train them to voluntarily participate in conservation science; observe researchers in action and learn how new technologies are developed to investigate animals in the wild; and understand how studies done at the lab underpin field research aimed at protecting narwhals and other marine mammal populations around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to show people how we work with the resident animals, what we learn from them, and how we are able to apply that information to understand the impacts that human disturbances are having on animals in the wild,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>Since her appointment in September as the inaugural director of research initiatives for the Seymour Center, Williams has been working to create and develop public programs at the Seymour Center that highlight the work of researchers at UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a>. She said faculty are excited about explaining their work to the public, and being forced online by the pandemic has created new opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of us who do field research have photos, videos, and other documentation of what we are seeing in the environment year after year, and it&#8217;s an amazing resource. We are the frontline workers for the environment and are witnessing what is happening to this planet. Our scientists have stories to tell about marine life and the marine environment&#8212;these are passionate people who are trying to save the oceans, and we want to bring their stories and their science to the public,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>To develop the Scientists Saving the Oceans program, Williams worked closely with Beau Richter, head trainer for the Marine Mammal Physiology Project, and Kevin Keedy, youth programs manager at the Seymour Center. Keedy and Richter helped transform the center&#8217;s popular Ocean Explorers summer camp into an online virtual program last summer, and Seymour Center staff have been creating a variety of <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/students-teachers/distance-learning/">distance learning programs</a> to support teachers and families with virtual visits to the Seymour Center.</p>
<p>The center is offering a variety of other programs in virtual formats while its physical site remains closed to the public due to the pandemic. These include the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/science-sundays/">Science Sundays</a> lecture series; <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/family-activities/family-events/">ocean-themed celebrations</a> such as the upcoming Elephant Seal Week (Feb. 21-27), featuring at-home activities, lectures, and interviews with scientists; the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/labside-chats/">Labside Chats</a> series of online conversations with scientists; and the members-only <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/aquaria-exploration/">Aquaria Explorations</a>.</p>
<p>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is a community-supported marine science education center at the UC Santa Cruz Coastal Science Campus. The Seymour Center is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>02-08-2021</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3aeeedc4807270172c1b96bda0ac779f"><name>2020-giving-year-in-review</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A year of generosity</title><summary>In 2020, UCSC donors demonstrated how giving can make a positive difference even in a period of turmoil.</summary><start-date>1611599400000</start-date><display-name>A year of generosity</display-name><path>/2021/01/2020-giving-year-in-review</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/2020-giving-year-in-review</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1611601472906</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1624061434023</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.

In many cases, though, the year&#8217;s adversity drove the activities of UCSC researchers and donors. Like characters in a superhero movie, they ran toward the trouble even as most people were just trying to find safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it disrupted schedules, the pandemic didn&#8217;t hamper </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/giving-day-2020-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020&#8217;s Giving Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised one of its highest-ever totals&#8212;providing direct funding for nearly 100 student groups and academic programs. Meanwhile, generosity poured in to help </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/slug-support-covid-19.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support ensure the pandemic wouldn&#8217;t derail students' academic goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/czufireaftermathstory.html">Donors responded again after</a></span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/czufireaftermathstory.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;August&#8217;s CZU Lightning Complex fires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;when numerous </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2020/10/fire-loss-and-the-embrace-of-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staff, faculty, and students saw their homes burned to the ground</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Donors truly rose to the challenges 2020 presented,&#8221; said Associate Vice Chancellor of Development Jeff Shilling. &#8220;The generosity and dedication of the UCSC community was on full display.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers and donors earned widespread praise for contributions to the fight against COVID-19. In early February the Genomics Institute created the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/coronavirus-browser.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SARS CoV-2 Genome Browser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has become a critical tool for scientists worldwide. Private support has been instrumental in the browser&#8217;s development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, a group of scientists, with support from key donors, uprighted a diagnostic lab in a temporary space to meet Santa Cruz County&#8217;s urgent need for COVID-19 testing. In December, thanks to a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/12/covid-testing-lab.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant gift from Bud and Rebecca Colligan, the lab found a permanent home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When the need for virus testing subsides, the lab's genetic sequencing capacity will be devoted to identifying effective treatments for persistent cancers.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Growing support for research and scholarship</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a $2.6 million grant, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/conservation-scholars.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewed its support for the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;two-year conservation-focused preparation for environmental and science careers. Faculty director Erika Zavaleta says an emphasis on inclusion aims to improve the variety of backgrounds represented in those fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our scholars and alumni are already becoming leaders and influencers in conservation and beginning to bring to fruition the program&#8217;s vision of a diverse group of future conservation leaders,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new endowment from the Hellman Fellows Fund </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/hellman.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">established permanent funding for the highly effective awards to early-career professors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Santa Cruz mountains, pumas are top predators, patrolling a diverse landscape of forests, meadows, peaks, and valleys. But &#8220;mountain lion country&#8221; is also bordered by coastal cities to the west and Silicon Valley to the east, with major roadways and fringes of development reaching into wildlands. As a result, humans have become a major source of mortality and fear for these cats. UC Santa Cruz researchers have shown that pumas will go to great lengths to avoid human &#8220;super predators,&#8221; even bolting away from food at the sound of human voices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the research team&#8217;s latest work shows that these types of avoidance behaviors take a serious toll on pumas. A new paper, published in </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2004592118"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that fear of humans causes mountain lions to increase their energy expenditures as they move through the landscape, and this can ultimately limit the size of the home ranges they&#8217;re able to maintain. Researchers are concerned about the long term impacts this might have on pumas and the ecosystems they help to regulate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mountain lions fear us, and that fear has all kinds of impacts on their behavior and ecology, and ultimately, potentially even their populations and conservation,&#8221; said Professor Chris Wilmers, the senior author on the paper.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilmers is principal investigator for the Santa Cruz Puma Project, through which he and colleagues have been studying local mountain lion populations for over a decade. Barry Nickel, director of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Integrated Spatial Research, led the most recent study, which relied on data from five adult female pumas and eight adult males that were outfitted with tracking collars as they roamed their natural habitats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Calculating energy costs</strong></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="A puma lounging in a tree wearing a tracking collar." class="" height="300" src="../../2019/11/images/wilmers-mercury-puma_450.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="450"/>
<figcaption>Tracking collars helped the research team calculate how many calories <br/> mountain lions burned, which offered new insight into how physical terrain <br/> and fear of humans affect habitat use. Photo by Sebastian Kennerknecht.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the two-month study period, the collars that researchers placed on wild pumas recorded high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data, which Wilmers said worked &#8220;essentially like a Fitbit&#8221; to help the team estimate how many calories a mountain lion burned based on where, how far, and how fast the cat was moving. The ultimate goal was to integrate the energy cost of navigating physical terrain with the cost of avoiding humans to see how both factors affect use of habitats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To assess the impacts of physical terrain, researchers compared topography with trends in the cats&#8217; movement data. This showed that less rugged terrain requires less energy for pumas to navigate, which may help to explain why mountain lions prefer habitats with easy-to-traverse valleys or ridges. And to get a sense for how fear of humans affected the cats, researchers also compared housing densities with collar tracking data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This analysis showed that, in areas with higher housing densities, pumas were engaging in more energetically demanding movements, like stopping less and moving more quickly. Their movements were also much less efficient: instead of taking the shortest path to their destination, they took longer, meandering paths to navigate around perceived risks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Humans, as a risk factor, are actually increasing the energy an animal needs to traverse this landscape,&#8221; Nickel explained. &#8220;And this is primarily through changes in their behavior as a means to avoid humans.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Fear takes a serious toll</strong></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Color-coded GPS tracks for four pumas in the Santa Cruz mountains" class="" height="300" src="images/tracking-data-450.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="450"/>
<figcaption>Tracking data for four male pumas shows a stark difference in the total <br/> home range area covered by pumas in habitats with the highest housing <br/> density (purple and brown tracks) compared with those in wildlands <br/> (yellow and blue tracks).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The constant vigilance cats used as they moved through human-dominated landscapes is incredibly energy intensive. Nickel and the research team estimate that, in otherwise identical terrain, pumas expend 13 percent more calories per five-minute period in habitats close to people than they would in remote wildland habitats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, researchers found that fear of humans had a greater impact than variations in terrain on the amount of energy it takes for mountain lions to move about their habitats. In fact, the effect of increasing housing density on energetic costs of movement was four to 10 times greater than the effect of increasing slope and ruggedness of the terrain.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a problem because researchers haven&#8217;t observed a corresponding increase in calorie consumption from the cats, and the other most likely way pumas might compensate for increased energy costs in navigating their habitats would be to reduce the total size of their territories. This trend showed up very clearly in the tracking data.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both males and females showed reduced size in their home ranges associated with overall increased energy costs of navigating the landscape, but males, in particular, were especially affected by housing density. Male pumas in habitats most dominated by humans had 78.8 percent smaller home ranges compared to those with the most remote habitats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human-induced risk has actually become the primary driver of male patterns of space use among pumas, according to the paper. Females didn&#8217;t show this same trend, but the research team suspects males may be more vulnerable to human impacts because they typically have to establish larger home ranges to improve their odds of finding a mate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Conservation implications</strong></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Aerial view of housing developments stretching out into rolling hills near the Santa Cruz mountains" class="" height="300" src="images/sprawl-450.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="450"/>
<figcaption>Protecting pumas will require limiting the amount of development that <br/> reaches into natural areas around the Santa Cruz mountains. Photo by <br/> Sebastian Kennerknecht.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, researchers are concerned that pressure to avoid humans may harm the health of local mountain lion populations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It constrains their space use, which could then affect other aspects of their ecology, like finding mates, finding food, competing with other males, or other natural interactions,&#8221; Nickel said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because these cats are apex predators that help to control populations of prey&#8212;like deer and racoons&#8212;any impacts to puma populations have the potential to cascade out and affect other species. That makes mountain lions a key factor in the long term health of ecosystems across the Santa Cruz mountains.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team hopes this will motivate consideration of ways to reduce human impacts. Wilmers says one of the best strategies for helping pumas is to limit the amount of development that reaches into natural areas, so that these cats can have safe places to roam without fear.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we continue to develop California in the way we historically have, we're going to lose this species,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;But if we focus our development on making housing more dense in the areas where it already exists, like cities, then we stand a chance of keeping mountain lions with us well into the future.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3be26dc3807270172c1b96bd9afbf909"><name>pathways-to-retirement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pathways To Retirement Program Launched</title><summary>I’m pleased to announce the launch of the Pathways to Retirement program for Senate faculty.</summary><start-date>1611561600000</start-date><display-name>Pathways To Retirement Program Launched</display-name><path>/2021/01/pathways-to-retirement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/pathways-to-retirement</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1611617430950</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1611617430950</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I&#8217;m pleased to announce the launch of the Pathways to Retirement program for Senate faculty.

The areas include parts of Ben Lomond, Boulder Creek, Felton, and Davenport &#8212; mainly the areas that saw significant fire damage in this summer&#8217;s CZU Fire. If you are unsure whether you are in an evacuation zone, check the <a href="https://community.zonehaven.com/?latlon=37.27818593866239,-122.06498556985503&amp;z=8.852978779050167" rel="noopener" target="_blank">county&#8217;s interactive online map</a>. High winds and power outages are also anticipated.<br/><br/>Though the residential campus, Westside Research Park, Coastal Science Campus and Scotts Valley Center are not within the evacuation zone and are not threatened, we know some employees and students live in impacted areas. Temporary shelter information is available at the <a href="http://santacruzcounty.us/firerecovery/temporaryevacuationpoints.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">county evacuation webpage</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Employees facing work disruption</strong><br/><br/>For our employees who are impacted and unable to work, either due to evacuation or power loss, please inform your manager or department chair of your status and let them know what types of support you need and the best way to reach you. Administrative leaves will be available for those impacted. <br/><br/>We ask that managers and supervisors, many of whom are impacted themselves, show as much flexibility as possible in accommodating employee needs. Work priorities should be examined in light of this emergency situation. <br/><br/><strong>Disruptions to instruction</strong><br/> <br/>While instruction continues, we understand the uncertainty and disturbance that sudden evacuations and electricity loss can cause. Students who have been evacuated or are without electricity may lose internet access and other instructional resources. They also may be dislocated from their homes or be unable to find a quiet location to participate in class or to do assigned work. We encourage instructors to be flexible in this emergency situation. Students may need extra time or other accommodations to be able to complete work.<br/> <br/>Instructors and TAs may also be impacted by evacuations or power outages, and may not be able to find an appropriate space for the delivery of instruction. Should this occur, communication between instructors and TAs and with students is critically important, as is communication with the department chair or college provost sponsoring the course. <a href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keepteaching.ucsc.edu</a> and last year&#8217;s <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/missed-content.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fall guidance</a> are also useful resources. <br/> <br/><strong>Students and employees needing assistance</strong><br/> <br/>Slug Support is available to provide students with immediate food, housing, and other essential needs.

I first met Harold in 1962 while an undergraduate at Cornell. Already a full professor, he had a reputation as a brilliant lecturer, and he was the only professor I ever knew whose graduate student audiences could erupt mid-class in spontaneous applause. His John von Neumann-like mathematical quickness was legendary; he could answer your questions before you even finished the sentence.</p>
<p>Born in Newark, New Jersey, on September 23, 1932, Harold attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan together with two other famous 20th century mathematicians, Elias Stein of Princeton and Paul Cohen of Stanford, who would all ultimately specialize in the field of mathematical analysis. Elias was one year older than Harold, and Paul two years younger.</p>
<p>Paul, who would go on to win a Fields Medal in Mathematics in 1962 in recognition of his path-breaking solution of Hilbert&#8217;s first problem, was generously tutored by Harold for several years in high school. Reflecting on his life in a speech at Stanford in 2001, Paul thanked Harold for the profound influence he had on his early mathematical career.</p>
<p>Harold received his Ph.D. at age 23 from the University of Chicago. He arrived at Cornell in 1955 and came under the influence of Mark Kac, who persuaded him to begin a study of the asymptotic behavior of the spectra of operators, especially Toeplitz operators. But despite the presence of Kac and having a close brother, Benjamin, on the Cornell faculty in chemistry, the Ithaca winters began to wear on him.</p>
<p>So in 1968 he accepted an offer from UCSC to become a founding member of our department. In 1994, Harold jumped at the opportunity for early retirement so he could focus his life on research. In the fall of 1991, his first UCSC Ph.D. student, Estelle Basor, now deputy director of the American Institute of Mathematics, had introduced Harold to the UC Davis mathematical physicist Craig Tracy, and they began working together. Upon retirement, Harold was able to focus on this collaboration and the rest is history. Their joint and seminal work on random matrices and their historic discovery of the Tracy-Widom distribution brought them both enormous fame and wide international recognition. In 2002 they won the George Polya Prize, in 2006 the Norbert Wiener Prize, and in 2020 the American Mathematical Society&#8217;s Steele Prize for Seminal Research. In 2006 Harold was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Harold Widom was a brilliant mathematician and a truly wonderful person. It was one of my life&#8217;s great blessings to have had him as an inspiring teacher, a colleague for over 50 years, and as a close friend. His profound mathematical discoveries place him among the giants of the University of California.</p>
<p>Harold is survived by his wife Linda Larkin; former wife Lois Widom; brother Benjamin Widom; daughter Dr. Barbara Widom, an endocrinologist in Fort Collins, Colorado; daughter Jennifer Widom, Frederick Emmons Terman Dean of Engineering at Stanford University; son Steven Widom, a software engineer; and four grandchildren.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Anthony Tromba, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fd759a5807270172c1b96bdf48c07e0"><name>chancellor-adviser</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Digital NEST founder to serve as external adviser to chancellor</title><summary>Jacob Martinez is bringing his insight on economic opportunity, community empowerment and digital innovation to UC Santa Cruz as an external special adviser to Chancellor Cindy Larive.&#13;

<p>It was 2006, and the UC Santa Cruz alumnus and eventual Digital NEST founder was organizing field trips to bring young people from the Pajaro Valley to Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s just 30 miles by car, but it might as well have been a million miles away.</p>
<p>Federal programs were dumping millions of dollars into programs to help bridge the digital divide &#8212; to expose youth from low-income communities to technology and to the myriad opportunities it can provide &#8212; but Martinez just wasn&#8217;t seeing the needle move. Despite years of effort, too few Pajaro Valley youth had managed to bridge anything, securing neither the educational opportunities that could brighten their economic prospects nor actual jobs in the nearby global center of high-tech.</p>
<p>So what if he were to flip the model, Martinez thought. What if he were to stop bringing Watsonville youth to Silicon Valley and instead bring the valley to them. &#8220;All of a sudden it&#8217;s not this scary unknown thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Having top technology. Having coaches and mentors. Being in an office with this great free food. It&#8217;s all normal. It&#8217;s in their community. All the while we&#8217;re arming them with the skills they need to thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so was born Digital NEST &#8212; the epiphany for Martinez that is now paying dividends for Watsonville and Salinas-area youth.</p>
<p>Martinez is bringing his insight on economic opportunity, community empowerment and digital innovation to UC Santa Cruz as an external special adviser to Chancellor Cindy Larive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Jacob does and what we as a university aim to do are perfectly aligned,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;We are focused on opportunity and access to higher education, and changing the life trajectories of our students. It&#8217;s the same thing Jacob does at the grassroots level, simply writ large. There are many areas where his ideas and expertise can boost our efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of only four Hispanic Serving Institutions that is also a member of the esteemed Association of American Universities, a collection of the top research universities in North America, and one of just 22 HSIs in the U.S. also classified as a doctoral degree granting university with high levels of research activity (an R1 Carnegie classification for highly intensive research institutions).</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz earned the HSI designation from the U.S. Department of Education in 2012, when it enrolled more than 25 percent Latinx students. The designation allows UCSC to apply for federal grants focused on advancing educational equity and strengthening support for Latinx students and other underrepresented and low-income students. Campus has numerous ongoing HSI initiatives. They are at the center of the university&#8217;s institutional commitment to student success.</p>
<p>Larive said Martinez&#8217;s insights and perspective will be critical as the campus strives to build racial equity in higher education opportunities and attainment, while also disrupting existing institutional barriers to equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achieving HSI status is one thing,&#8221; said Larive, &#8220;but we strive to live up to the values embodied in that designation and to serve our students effectively to ensure they thrive while at UCSC and beyond as alumni. Jacob will contribute greatly to those discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martinez (Oakes &#8217;04, evolutionary biology), a Southern California native who settled in Watsonville shortly after earning his degree, sees wide avenues of opportunity. &#8220;The university already has strong programs with community-based organizations. There are opportunities to add to those and to expand the ones already in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, community groups that are working to lift up young people, especially in communities that haven&#8217;t seen the economic benefits of the tech boom, need strong young talent with technical and social-justice skills, Martinez added. Businesses in general, meanwhile, are looking for more diverse, socially conscious employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here we are,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;The university has so much going for it. It&#8217;s an HSI, so we have the diversity. Its proximity to Silicon Valley. The fact that it&#8217;s a major university founded on social justice. UCSC should be the first place businesses think of when they go looking for employees. I don&#8217;t see why UCSC can&#8217;t become an epicenter for social entrepreneurialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Digital NEST, which stands for Nurturing Entrepreneurial Skills with Technology, has come a long way since Martinez&#8217;s epiphany 15 years ago. He secured grants from organizations like the Packard Foundation and got donations from local agriculture companies. Adobe offered free software, while a venture capitalist pledged $100,000 in matching funds. Digital NEST ultimately launched seven years ago.</p>
<p>The NEST has evolved into what Martinez envisioned: a technology workforce development hub with sleek desks, comfy couches, a big-screen TV, even free snacks to fuel creativity. New members are handed laptops loaded with the latest software. Students are given help writing resumes and creating their own projects, and can gain experience by hiring out to small businesses who might need technology help.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all remote now, at least temporarily, but the vision remains strong. A more high-profile location in Salinas will open soon and a Gilroy spot is in the works. New sites in the Bay Area are also planned.</p>
<p>Martinez, meanwhile, sits on the boards of directors of Santa Cruz Works, the Association of Science and Technology Centers, and United Way Monterey County, among others. In 2020 he received The James Irvine Foundation &#8220;Leadership Award,&#8221; and in 2018 he was presented with the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership Community Impact Award.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can build an ecosystem &#8212; Digital NEST, community groups, the university, local businesses,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;I want to see young people get the skills they need to find a good job in their own communities or to create their own jobs if they choose. That allows them to stay. That strengthens the community. That&#8217;s my motivation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larive agrees. &#8220;We often talk about the university&#8217;s positive economic impact on the region in dollars and cents kind of ways. But one of our true economic impacts is when we innovate a program or foster economic opportunities that allow the young people who grow up here to find jobs locally so they have the option of staying and contributing locally. That&#8217;s exactly where the university&#8217;s vision and Jacob&#8217;s passion meet.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="401352fb807270172c1b96bd6b0e6fc6"><name>ca-lifts-limited-stay-at-home-order</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California lifts Limited Stay at Home Order; Santa Cruz County remains in purple tier</title><summary>The Limited Stay-at-Home Order announced in December has been lifted.

<p>As a graduate student working with Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, John studied the physiology of diving in marine mammals to help inform conservation and management policy.</p>
<p>The CCST Science &amp; Technology Policy Fellows program annually recruits and trains a cohort of fifteen Ph.D. scientists and engineers to spend one year working in Sacramento, directly serving decision makers within the California State Legislature and Executive Branch. Now in its eleventh year, the CCST Science Fellows program helps California policy makers access some of the talent and staff they need to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>During their year of public service, the fellows get a front-row seat learning about the craft and process of policymaking in the state of California. CCST Science Fellows work alongside decision makers to evaluate complex scientific issues and interpret data, while tackling the responsibilities of full-time staffers.</p>
<p>John earned a B.S. in biology from Santa Clara University and worked in medical microbiology before pursuing graduate studies at UC Santa Cruz. Through his research in the Williams lab on the physiology of swimming and diving in marine mammals and birds, he had the opportunity to work with over a dozen different species in environments ranging from Florida to Antarctica.</p>
<p>The CCST Science Fellows gain valuable experience and training in public policy and leadership. In turn, state decision makers are given access to science-savvy staff who can inform policy discussions with scientific perspectives and expertise.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4843596b807270172c1b96bdec4bcdd5"><name>neh-research-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC awarded National Endowment for the Humanities grants to support faculty research</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has received two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support faculty research and writing leading to book projects.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz news, UCSC news, UCSC faculty research, UCSC NEH grants, UCSC  Humanities Division, history of drugs, Arab Spring</keywords><start-date>1611827700000</start-date><display-name>NEH grants to support faculty research</display-name><path>/2021/01/neh-research-grants</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/neh-research-grants</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1611825109325</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1611829963274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/breen-425-use-this.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/breen-425-use-this.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>breen-425-use-this.jpg</name><display-name>breen-425-use-this.jpg</display-name><file-size>139524</file-size><width>425</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt>Associate history professor Benjamin Breen</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/neh-grants-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/neh-grants-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neh-grants-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>neh-grants-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>50726</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Associate history professor Benjamin Breen</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Associate history professor Benjamin Breen</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/yasmeen-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/yasmeen-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yasmeen-325.jpg</name><display-name>yasmeen-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>129120</file-size><width>325</width><height>361</height></image><image-alt>Assistant politics professor Yasmeen Daifallah</image-alt><image-caption><span>Assistant politics professor Yasmeen Daifallah</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz has received two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support faculty research and writing leading to book projects.</span></p>
<p><span>The campus awards are part of $32.8 million in grants for 213 projects nationwide that the NEH has funded this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Associate history professor Benjamin Breen earned a faculty grant for his project &#8220;Experimental Drugs, Cold War Science, and the Future that Never Arrived, 1945&#8211;1965,&#8221; a book on scientific and social scientific experimentation with mind or body-altering drugs during the postwar era.</span></p>
<p><span>Breen&#8217;s book argues that the decades following World War II were marked by two major technological revolutions: the birth of the atomic era, and the rise of a new science of drugs called psychopharmacology. During this time period, some of the world&#8217;s most prominent researchers and writers became convinced that a variety of new experimental drugs&#8212;developed in tandem with new communication technologies and interest in indigenous knowledge&#8212;were the key to reshaping a post-war society that stood on the edge of catastrophe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In contrast to traditional drugs like penicillin, the new experimental drugs such as mescaline, LSD, synthetic hormones and sedatives were thought to go far beyond just treating disease and instead held the promise of ultimately transforming gender, curing schizophrenia, healing trauma, and possibly even preventing nuclear war. Breen&#8217;s book will be a history of this relatively unknown era of experimental drug research, the utopian visions that drove it, the reasons that it failed, and the lessons it can teach us today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Breen is also the author of <i>The Age of Intoxication</i>&#160;(University of Pennsylvania Press, 2019) which explores how drug users and sellers in the British and Portuguese empires helped to shape imperialism, global trade, and scientific practice in the 17th and 18th centuries. His research focuses on the history of globalization, science, drugs, and the long-term impacts of technological change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Assistant politics professor Yasmeen Daifallah</strong> received a fellowship grant for her project &#8220;Thinking Past Islam and the West: Theorizing Politics in Contemporary Arab Thought,&#8221; a book about the political views of three prominent contemporary Arab philosophers and historians.</span></p>
<p><span>The book reveals the existence of a sophisticated Arab intellectual landscape on the eve of the recent 2011 Arab uprisings by examining how three Arab political thinkers theorized political change between the 1980s and the 2000s. It focuses on Moroccan historian Abdullah Laroui, Egyptian philosopher Hassan Hanafi, and the late Moroccan philosopher Mohamed &#8216;Abed Al-Jabri. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Although their works have considerably influenced Arab intellectual debates on the achievement of political and cultural freedom in postcolonial times, little of it has been translated into English, despite their broad circulation and readership. As a result, this book is designed to be the first English-language systematic analysis of their political ideas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We take great pride in working with our faculty to identify students who have maximized the academic and social opportunities within their communities and demonstrated their ability to contribute to and benefit from the opportunities available at a major research university,&#8221; said Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the pairing of high-impact research with 10 tight-knit residential colleges offers undergraduate students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university. Even in the midst of remote learning and operations, our colleges have developed and supported each student&#8217;s transition to university study.</p>
<p>Since opening in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has been on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty conducting transformative research and scholarship that serves the world. UC Santa Cruz joined the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 2019 and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities in 2020, a remarkable achievement for a university not even 60 years old, underscoring the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz shares the distinction of being the youngest member of the esteemed 65-member AAU and is one of only four members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution. Additionally, for the second year in a row, UC Santa Cruz was ranked among the top-five universities nationally for student social mobility.</p>
<p>The competition to earn a spot at UC Santa Cruz will increase this year, with the campus receiving a record number of applications and nearly 200 students approved last year to defer their enrollment to fall 2021.</p>
<p>The campus received more than 74,000 applications from first-year and transfer students, an 11 percent increase from the previous year&#8217;s applications, according to <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/ug-data.html">preliminary data released today</a> by the UC Office of the President. The campus received more than 49,000 applications from California high school students, a 12 percent increase over the previous year, and more than 11,000 applications from students studying primarily at California community colleges, an 8 percent increase.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz received 24,690 applications from California students who will be the first person in their family to earn a four-year degree, and 22,822 applications from California students with families with low incomes.</p>
<p>Applications from first-year and transfer students outside of California, both domestic and international, increased by 10 percent.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz continued to see interest from ethnically diverse California students with this year&#8217;s figures.</p>
<p>Of California first-year applicants, 6 percent identify as African American; 32 percent as Asian American; 34 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; 0.5 percent as American Indian and 25 percent as white. Of the California community college applicants who are domestic students, 6 percent identify as African American; 28 percent as Asian American; 1 percent as American Indian; 32 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; and 32 percent as White.</p>
<p>First-year undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions beginning late-February, with most notifications in mid-March. Transfer decisions will begin to be released in mid-March. Admitted first-year students have until May 1 to indicate their intent to enroll and transfer students have until June 1.</p>
<h3>Excitement building for fall</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/planning-for-fall-quarter.html">planning to return</a> to primarily in-person instruction for fall 2021, after transitioning to mostly remote instruction because of the global pandemic. With a successful testing and vaccination program, UC Santa Cruz leaders believe the campus will be able to have the majority of its on-campus experiences return in the fall.</p>
<p>Though the global pandemic prevented in-person outreach this admissions cycle, Whittingham said the campus successfully mounted a series of online events and <a href="https://admissions.ucsc.edu/#virtualtour">virtual campus tours</a> to showcase all the opportunities that define a UC Santa Cruz education.</p>
<p>This cohort of future alumni, the Class of 2023 and the Class of 2025, will join more than 120,000 alumni who are making their own contributions locally, regionally, and globally.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4ae4c4a3807270172c1b96bd3f0e679e"><name>update-on-covid-19-vaccine-distribution</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on COVID-19 vaccine distribution</title><summary>Last week, I shared an update on the COVID-19 vaccine that included information on the updated Interim COVID-19 vaccination policy for employees.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>New state vaccination framework</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On Tuesday, the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.chhs.ca.gov/blog/2021/01/26/newsom-administration-supplements-vaccine-delivery-system-announces-creation-of-statewide-vaccine-delivery-network-to-simplify-and-standardize-vaccination-process-with-equity-as-a-core-focus/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611953854630000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4qVyBStOxpUBYMC1Zfp9iZ35oeg" href="https://www.chhs.ca.gov/blog/2021/01/26/newsom-administration-supplements-vaccine-delivery-system-announces-creation-of-statewide-vaccine-delivery-network-to-simplify-and-standardize-vaccination-process-with-equity-as-a-core-focus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>state announced changes</span></a><span> to the vaccine allocation process and framework. The goal is to provide consistency across counties and speed the distribution of vaccine doses across the state. Please note that the supply of vaccine doses received by the state continues to be dictated by the federal government. The changes include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Simplifying Eligibility</span><span> - The state is adjusting their grouping for vaccine eligibility. They will continue with Phase 1A, which includes health care workers, and Phase 1B, Tier 1 which includes individuals 65+ and those working in child care, emergency services, food, agriculture, and education. Future groups will then be eligible based on age. We could see additional changes to the state eligibility groups emerge over time.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Expanding Roll Out of the </span><span>My Turn</span><span> System</span><span>&#160; - The state has been piloting the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611953854630000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0snAqZ8q2Pet5eTPUOsWXM_WFPw" href="https://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>My Turn system</span></a><span>, whereby individuals can sign up for a notification when they are eligible to make an appointment to receive their COVID-19 vaccine. The pilot has taken place in Los Angeles and San Diego and the state expects to roll it out to other counties in February.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Streamlining Vaccination Distribution</span><span> - The state is engaging a third-party administrator to start allocating vaccine doses to public health systems, pharmacies, health systems, public hospitals, community health centers, pharmacies and pop-up and mobile sites.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Planning for upcoming distribution of doses to the UC system and UC Santa Cruz&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The University of California has developed an allocation model to distribute doses coming into the system. In looking out over the next few weeks, the UC system anticipates getting approximately 15,000 doses weekly from the state. The UC system doses are then allocated between UC Health Center patients and UC employees. Once the dose allocation goes through the state eligibility requirements, if the UC gets 15,000 doses weekly, that translates to approximately 200 doses per week for UC Santa Cruz. If the UC gets more doses in the weeks to come, then our allocation increases based on the distribution formula put in place.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we shared in prior communications, our campus has been in Phase 1A of the state framework and has focused on the allocation of our vaccine doses to those working in healthcare settings. The campus has received a total of 200 doses, since vaccines started rolling out in December.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With the anticipation of receiving additional doses in the weeks to come, our campus will now move into Phase 1B.&#160; The allocation of doses within the UC will use the following prioritization, in alignment with state eligibility groups.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Group 1</span><span> - Employees age 65+&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Group 2</span><span> - Employees working on-site in the following four areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Food service</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Child care</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>First responder</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Agriculture</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Group 3</span><span> - Employees working on-site in categories outside the four listed in Group 2</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>How quickly we get vaccines to the employees in these three groups will depend on the number of doses we get each week. To provide context, our campus has more than 2,000 employees that fall into the three groups above. As mentioned earlier, we estimate that we will receive approximately 200 doses per week over the next few weeks. That number could increase if the UC allocation from the state increases during this time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Here are some answers to key questions that might arise for you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>If I fall in one of the three groups above, how will I know when I can get my vaccination?&#160;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you fall into one of the three groups above, you will receive a notice from Student Health Services via your UCSC email account. The email will include instructions on your eligibility and how you should schedule your appointments.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What if I fall outside the three groups listed above?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After we get through the three groups listed above, and based on the current state framework, vaccine eligibility will be age based. For many employees, you may find that it is more timely to obtain a vaccine through an off-campus health care provider or vaccination site. It&#8217;s very hard to project the timing on this based on overall federal and state distribution. Be sure to read any notices that you receive from your health care provider in the event that you might be eligible through off-campus health care sooner than our campus vaccine program.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How will I make an appointment to get a vaccine on campus?&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When you are eligible to make an appointment on campus, you will be notified via your UCSC email account and receive detailed instructions from Student Health Services on how to make your appointment.&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>What can I do if I am not yet eligible to get a vaccine through campus?</strong>&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The continued roll-out of the vaccine brings hope on the horizon. I recognize, however, that the fact there are fewer vaccine doses than demand across the country and in our own community adds angst to the members of our Slug community as you navigate the pandemic and health concerns for yourselves and your loved ones. We continue to advocate as a campus and as a university system to get additional doses, and we are hopeful that we will see an increase in dose distribution. In the meantime, we continue to proactively encourage you to get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible through your healthcare provider or other means, if that opportunity arises before you can get a vaccine through the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What other steps should I be taking while waiting for the vaccine to roll out?&#160;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we work to implement the vaccine program and our allocation of doses increases, we must all continue to follow the Slug Strong actions that we have been promoting throughout the pandemic: wear a face covering, abide by physical distancing guidelines, avoid large gatherings, do not come to campus if you are feeling ill, and regularly wash your hands. In addition, please take advantage of the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611953854630000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpfwLtIPCnF8dJa2lBgCOPsEOJ6A" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>asymptomatic testing program</span></a><span> we have available for on-site employees.

Shepherd taught at UC Santa Cruz for more than 30 years before his retirement in 2015. He was an instrumental figure both within the university and in the lives of his students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd, or &#8220;Bob&#8221;, as many knew him, joined the economics faculty in 1983, following nearly two decades of governmental and corporate employment as a CPA. He went on to found the Economics Department&#8217;s accounting path. He was also a teacher and mentor to thousands of students and helped develop the business management economics undergraduate major. Throughout his tenure at UC Santa Cruz, Bob taught more than 17,000 students in the classroom and mentored nearly 1,700 students through independent study courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/shepherd-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015, Shepherd described what this work meant to him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The past 15 years have been the most rewarding period in my teaching career,&#8221; he said, at the time. &#8220;Many of the students, like myself, come from working class families and are often the first member of their family to go to a university. My emphasis is to prepare students for their future career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd was recognized many times over the years for his teaching skills and his dedication to students. He earned the UC Santa Cruz Excellence in Teaching Award in 2001 and 2011, the Universal Design of Instruction Award from the UCSC Disability Resource Center in 2011, the Golden Apple Distinguished Teaching Award from the Social Sciences Division in 1991, the Favorite Professor Award in 1991 and 1992 from the UCSC Alumni Association, and the 2015 outstanding educator award from the California Society of CPAs (CalCPA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bob led an admirable life,&#8221; said UCSC Distinguished Professor Emeritus Donald Wittman, who worked closely with Shepherd in the Economics Department. &#8220;He was kind, gentle, witty, and an inspirational teacher.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former students remember Shepherd for these attributes, too. His warm personality and sense of humor made his classes particularly interesting and enjoyable.&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bob taught accounting not just like another subject, but like a language or lifestyle,&#8221; Said Peter Bui, an Oakes College alumnus and 2007 graduate of the business management economics bachelor&#8217;s program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ofir Fatal, a 2006 business management economics graduate and current finance business manager at Intel, also praised Shepherd&#8217;s teaching style and mentorship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bob brought an energy and passion to the material that inspired me,&#8221; Fatal said. &#8220;He encouraged me to challenge my understanding and interpretation of the material, and he devoted countless hours of his personal time for the betterment of myself and all students under his tutelage.&#8221;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after Shepherd retired from teaching, he stayed involved with new student orientations, alumni events, the CalCPA scholarship program, and fall job fairs, through which he played an instrumental role in connecting his students with career paths. Shepherd founded and organized the department&#8217;s annual &#8220;Meet the Firms&#8221; day, which gives hundreds of students the chance to meet and interview with representatives of major accounting firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His dedication in attracting top firms to our campus provided opportunities for countless UCSC students,&#8221; said Economics Department Chair Alan Spearot. &#8220;Bob really put our accounting program on the map and set the bar for professional development.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, through the generosity of donors, the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/robert-j-shepherd/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert J. Shepherd Economics Accounting Path Scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was founded in Shepherd&#8217;s honor to support academically high-achieving students focusing on accounting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd was also remarkably dedicated to keeping up with his students after they graduated, continuing the mentorship that proved so successful while on campus. When he retired, he wrote in the </span><a href="https://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/downloads/Econ-Newsletter-S2012.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">department&#8217;s newsletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hearing from former students and getting updates on their careers was a deeply gratifying experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am especially elated when [a student] writes and tells me they have passed the national Certified Public Accountant examination or have gotten that big promotion,&#8221; Shepherd wrote, at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd will be remembered as a friendly and generous person who made everyone on campus feel welcome and &#8220;always made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">time for a conversation about teaching, travels, and life more generally,&#8221; said Alan Spearot. Shepherd will be deeply missed, but his impact and legacy will endure, at the university and beyond.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bob's memory will live on through his students,&#8221; said Ofir Fatal. &#8220;And I am proud to have been one of them.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50b795a1807270172c1b96bde1bcc80d"><name>public-safety-power-shutoffs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sociology researcher seeks solutions for Public Safety Power Shutoffs</title><summary>Sociology researcher Les Guliasi’s most recent paper shows how “microgrid” technologies could reduce the impact of outages, if regulatory challenges can be resolved.</summary><start-date>1611907200000</start-date><display-name>Public safety power shutoff solutions</display-name><path>/2021/01/public-safety-power-shutoffs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/public-safety-power-shutoffs</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1611966944639</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612111996656</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/power-lines-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/power-lines-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>power-lines-400.jpg</name><display-name>power-lines-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>39166</file-size><width>400</width><height>259</height></image><image-alt>Overhead powerlines in the fog, silhouetted against the sun and sky</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/01/images/power-lines-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/01/images/power-lines-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>power-lines-80.jpg</name><display-name>power-lines-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>19161</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Overhead powerlines in the fog, silhouetted against the sun and sky</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an Public Safety Power Shutoff, there&#8217;s no electricity flowing in through utility power lines.

To combat these growing risks, the state&#8217;s electric utilities are increasingly implementing Public Safety Power Shutoffs: intentional power outages that de-energize power lines when weather conditions, like strong winds, threaten to damage equipment and spark a wildfire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these measures can help to reduce wildfire risk, the outages they cause are disruptive and potentially even dangerous, says Les Guliasi, a researcher in the UC Santa Cruz Sociology Department, who has decades of utility industry experience. According to Guliasi, Public Safety Power Shutoffs were originally envisioned as a measure of last resort, but they&#8217;re now becoming a more common default strategy for utilities. And he&#8217;s concerned about the effects that more frequent power outages could have on local economies and communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all depend on electricity to manage our daily lives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Any disruption in the delivery of electricity is a big concern.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Guliasi has been following the proceedings of the California Public Utilities Commission as they seek to reduce the impacts of Public Safety Power shutoffs. His observations were recently published in the journal </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304175"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Research and Social Science</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Guliasi is particularly interested in the potential for new &#8220;microgrid&#8221; technologies to limit the extent and effects of future outages.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microgrids are localized energy generation resources that allow individual buildings, or even whole communities, to keep the lights on when there&#8217;s no electricity flowing in through utility power lines. For example, a building with solar panels, battery storage, and a backup generator could reliably produce its own electricity during a Public Safety Power Shutoff. Some key facilities, such as hospitals and fire stations, already have this capacity, and technological advances are now making it possible to deploy at larger scales.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microgrids offer an advantage because they operate very differently from traditional energy delivery systems, where large amounts of energy are produced remotely and transmitted over long distances to reach consumers. A key challenge of traditional systems is that large numbers of people across wide geographic regions are all depending on the same energy source, and any interruptions of transmission affect everyone. Guliasi believes it&#8217;s time for a change.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The current energy delivery system is really still a relic of the 19th and 20th centuries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we can have the production of electricity more localized, it gives the end-user greater control over both the production and consumption of their electricity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State of California started to get behind this concept in 2018, when Senate Bill 1339 directed the California Public Utilities Commission to facilitate the commercialization of microgrids. Then, in December 2019, the state&#8217;s largest electric utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company (PG&amp;E), presented a plan for deploying a microgrid enablement program before the next fire season. But Guliasi&#8217;s report details how the proceedings hit a snag from there.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complications arose primarily around how the energy would be produced to supply the proposed microgrids. Environmental, social justice, and consumer advocates wanted to see energy generated using only wind, solar, and battery storage, which was not a stipulation of PG&amp;E&#8217;s original plan. And Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) providers&#8212;local governmental organizations tasked with choosing energy sources on behalf of their communities&#8212;also objected to PG&amp;E making decisions about how to power microgrids within CCA service areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to these challenges, PG&amp;E withdrew their microgrid plan and instead contracted mobile diesel generators as a backup power source for the 2020 fire season. Diesel fuel has harmful environmental and health effects, so Guliasi considers this outcome a breakdown of the California Public Utilities Commission's decision-making process, resulting in a &#8220;lose-lose&#8221; situation for all parties involved.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis cited in Guliasi&#8217;s article showed that a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; approach to microgrids&#8212;combining solar power, battery storage, and backup generators powered by either natural gas or renewable biogas&#8212;could have provided reliable backup power in a much cleaner way than diesel generators. Guliasi hopes to see solutions like this deployed for future fire seasons, if the regulatory process can be navigated more successfully.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guliasi hopes his paper will offer a cautionary tale to help regulators, utilities, and stakeholders alike see beyond all-or-nothing approaches and instead keep an eye out for solutions that balance short-term needs for energy resilience with longer-term decarbonization goals.&#160;</span></p>

The society recognized three winners, along with a runner-up and an honorable mention. Shange&#8217;s book, </span><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/progressive-dystopia"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Dystopia: Abolition, Antiblackness, and Schooling in San Francisco</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was among those that shared top honors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first time that the award has been given to multiple books, so it was really great to feel like there&#8217;s a shift in the discipline to really celebrating collective work and to democratizing the idea of excellence,&#8221; Shange said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an assistant professor of anthropology and a principal faculty member for the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies program, Shange studies Black diaspora. In particular, her book draws upon her experience teaching for six years at a progressive, social justice-oriented high school in San Francisco. The school was intended to serve youth of color and had a majority of Latinx students, but it also had the district&#8217;s highest suspension rates for Black students. Shange wanted to understand why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I went to graduate school in order to solve problems that the staff was trying to address, in terms of how this overall very successful school was still being dogged by racial disparities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How can a place that&#8217;s sending the most Black kids to college also be the place that&#8217;s suspending the most Black students? I learned that what I thought was a contradiction or an anomaly was actually a fundamental structural problem constituted by the project of antiracism and social justice, as we usually enact it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of Shange&#8217;s inquiry are captured within </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Dystopia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through extensive ethnographic fieldwork, she documented how the school&#8217;s practice of antiracism was still situated in a culture and structure of anti-Blackness that marginalized Black people within the multiracial progressive movement. Black students or teachers who defied norms or challenged policies and curricula at the school were pushed out, with students being encouraged to transfer and some teachers ultimately quitting their jobs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Shange said one of the most important takeaways from her book is that &#8220;the most progressive places can still be the most dangerous for Black youth and families to survive.&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Dystopia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzes the social forces underlying this phenomena and contrasts examples of successful long-term multiracial coalition-building with other efforts that fall short.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are these existing traditions of really fruitful multiracial struggle, and that&#8217;s not the same thing as a nonprofit swooping in and writing a mission statement,&#8221; Shange said. &#8220;I think the more that highly-funded social programs can actually be in communication with and listening to and taking their lead from existing social formations, you&#8217;ll be able to get somewhere different from there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shange said she&#8217;s grateful to fellow UC Santa Cruz faculty members who workshoped manuscript drafts of the book with her and provided feedback to help shape the final product. She&#8217;s also been glad to hear from research participants who told her that reading the book validated their experiences. For Shange, having her book recognized within the field has been a validating experience, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This award, and the choices of all of the books that were celebrated, tells me that it&#8217;s okay to tell hard stories in ethnography,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Continuing to look at the actual practice of antiracist politics, especially in this time, is something that&#8217;s worthwhile, and that&#8217;s really what I was trying to do with this book.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77dbf860807270172c1b96bd222731b5"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>January</title><start-date>1609488000000</start-date><display-name>January</display-name><path>/2021/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/01/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1608328673361</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609866884900</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
