<p>The new study, led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, was <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg2906">published June 2 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>. The findings provide crucial information for understanding the causes of low oxygen or &#8220;hypoxia&#8221; in the North Pacific and for predicting the occurrence of hypoxic conditions in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is essential to understand whether climate change is pushing the oceans toward a &#8216;tipping point&#8217; for abrupt and severe hypoxia that would destroy ecosystems, food sources, and economies,&#8221; said first author Karla Knudson, who led the study as a graduate student in Earth sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>The researchers based their findings on an analysis of deep sediment cores from a site in the Bering Sea. Over long periods of time, sediments are deposited and build up on the seafloor. The activity of organisms living in the seafloor sediments usually disrupts and mixes them as they accumulate, but if hypoxia has killed those organisms, an orderly pattern of layers is preserved. Thus, scientists can find a record of past hypoxic events in the form of these layered or &#8220;laminated&#8221; sediments in cores drilled from the seafloor.</p>
<p>Scientists have long known about a major episode of widespread hypoxia in the North Pacific at the end of the last ice age, when the melting of the ice sheets sent a massive influx of fresh water into the ocean. The new study provides the first records of earlier low-oxygen events, and shows that the most recent occurrence was not representative of most of these events in terms of mechanisms or timing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take a huge perturbation like melting ice sheets for this to happen,&#8221; said corresponding author Ana Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;These abrupt hypoxic events are actually common in the geologic record, and they are not typically associated with deglaciation. They almost always happen during the warm interglacial periods, like the one we&#8217;re in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hypoxia occurs after intense growth of phytoplankton (marine algae) in the surface waters. When the phytoplankton die, they sink deeper into the ocean and decompose, which depletes the oxygen and releases carbon dioxide into the water below the surface. What triggers these events, however, remains unclear. Ocean warming, high sea levels, and the availability of iron (a limiting factor for growth of phytoplankton) all seem to play a role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study shows that high sea levels, which occur during warm interglacial climates, contributed to these hypoxic events,&#8221; Knudson said. &#8220;During high sea levels, dissolved iron from the flooded continental shelves can be transferred to the open ocean and promote intense phytoplankton growth in the surface waters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although high sea level is an important background condition, it is not enough to trigger a hypoxic event by itself. Changes in ocean circulation, including intensified upwelling to bring more nutrients into the surface waters and stronger currents that could transfer iron from the continental shelf to the open ocean, may play a critical role, Knudson said.</p>
<p>Currently, regional dead zones occur in coastal areas around the world due to the temperature effects of climate warming, as well as nutrient enrichment of coastal waters from agricultural fertilizers. But even the massive dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi River pales in comparison to the widespread hypoxia that occurred all across the North Pacific Ocean at the end of the last ice age.</p>
<p>Because the new study is based on sediment cores from a single site, the researchers do not know the extent of the dead zones it records&#8212;whether they were confined to the Bering Sea or extended across the North Pacific rim as the most recent event did.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how extensive they were, but we do know they were very intense and lasted longer than the deglaciation event that has been so well studied,&#8221; said Ravelo, who was co-chief scientist of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 323, which recovered the Bering Sea cores in 2009.</p>
<p>Knudson said the cores record multiple events during each interglacial period throughout the Pleistocene, with abrupt transitions where laminated sediments appear and disappear in the core.</p>
<p>The new findings raise concerns about whether climate change and ocean warming will lead to a tipping point that would trigger widespread hypoxia in the North Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system is primed for this type of event happening,&#8221; Ravelo said. &#8220;We need to know how extensive they were, and we need to rethink how these events are triggered, because we now know that it doesn&#8217;t take a huge perturbation. This study sets the stage for a lot of follow-up work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grant will fund a new project to develop and deploy a novel acoustic recorder for eavesdropping on the ocean soundscape. Beltran plans to use this new technology to monitor the acoustic environment of elephant seals, which migrate thousands of miles across the North Pacific Ocean. By using elephant seals as a mobile sensor platform to carry the acoustic recorder, Beltran will explore poorly understood areas of the open ocean, including the &#8220;twilight zone&#8221; just beyond the reach of sunlight (below about 650 feet).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to figure out what the open ocean and the twilight zone sound like to an elephant seal&#8212;what sounds they are exposed to in terms of both manmade noise like shipping traffic as well as other species like whales,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For over three decades, UCSC researchers have been tagging and studying elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve, managed by the UC Natural Reserve System. Daniel Costa, distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences, has been a pioneer in the development and use of electronic tags to track the movements and behavior of elephant seals and other marine mammals and to gather oceanographic data.</p>
<p>Beltran, a UCSC alumna (Stevenson &#8217;13, marine biology) who joined Costa&#8217;s lab as a postdoctoral researcher before being appointed to the faculty, has a decade of experience working with elephant seals and other marine mammals. The new project will expand into the acoustic realm her lab&#8217;s ongoing efforts to study the ocean environment and ecology of migrating elephant seals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of understanding ocean sounds has increased significantly in recent years, but our ability to monitor the soundscapes of the open ocean is logistically difficult,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;Elephant seals have provided an excellent platform for measuring ocean temperature and salinity, and Roxanne&#8217;s study will add ocean acoustics to those crucial baseline measurements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oceanographers and biologists have used various approaches to monitor sound in the ocean, but most are limited to areas near the coast. Ship-based surveys can go beyond coastal regions, but they are expensive and limited by the noise of the ship. Elephant seals migrate far offshore and move quietly and rapidly through the ocean ecosystem in search of prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using elephant seals is like having a smart sensor for biological hot spots, because they navigate straight to the regions with lots of productivity and prey. They can tell us a lot about the environment out in the middle of the open ocean,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>The tags will effectively eavesdrop on whales by recording their vocalizations and echolocations, and will also detect ships, sonar, and other sounds in the open ocean. Beltran said she is excited to find out what the tags will reveal about the soundscape of the North Pacific Ocean. Among other things, she hopes to learn more about the elusive beaked whales, a poorly understood family of deep-diving whales.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also be able to learn if elephant seals are exposed to noises from sonar or oil exploration and how that affects them,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;We think acoustic cues are hugely important to elephant seals because they spend a lot of time in complete darkness, feeding at night and at depth, but we have no idea what they hear out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>By enabling more comprehensive monitoring of ocean noise and revealing the most prevalent and harmful sound sources, the project will provide valuable information and recommendations for marine mammal conservation.</p>
<p>The first stage of the project will be to develop a durable high-capacity acoustic recorder with the specifications needed for the project. Beltran will work with her colleague Holger Klinck, an acoustics expert at Cornell University, to develop the necessary hardware and software. Improvements in the acoustic tags will include longer duration recordings and a stronger housing to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean.</p>
<p>After testing and validation of the new devices, the researchers will attach them to 24 adult female elephant seals over three years starting in February 2022. The tags are attached to the seals&#8217; fur and are removed when the animals return to the beach and molt. The fidelity of elephant seals to their breeding grounds enables the researchers to reliably recover the tags. Beltran plans to train a team of UCSC undergraduate students to assist with the field work and undertake independent projects through the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/work-study-initiative.html">Undergraduate Work-Study Research Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to teaching us about large marine vertebrates, our fieldwork provides an ideal outdoor classroom for the next generation of biologists,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Beckman Young Investigator Program provides research support to the most promising young faculty members in the early stages of their academic careers in the chemical and life sciences, particularly to foster the invention of methods, instruments, and materials that will open up new avenues of research in science.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel lucky for the opportunity to be a part of this foundation and to contribute to the legacy of Dr. Beckman, a kind and curious innovator who is making it possible for young scientists to dream big,&#8221; Beltran said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c958d25180727017480ce726ae35ff1d"><name>keynote-pride</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebrating Pride Month</title><summary>With the start of  June, which is Pride Month, we reaffirm our support of UC Santa Cruz’s LGBTQIA+ community, and the push to build an inclusive, and more equitable world, where all are respected, treated equally, and provided equal opportunities regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. </summary><start-date>1622530800000</start-date><display-name>Celebrating Pride Month</display-name><path>/2021/06/keynote-pride</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/keynote-pride</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1622580711989</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1624307493698</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>pride</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/pride-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/pride-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pride-500px.jpg</name><display-name>pride-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>182312</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Progress Pride Flag hanging from a building</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the start of June, which is Pride Month, we reaffirm our support of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s LGBTQIA+ community, and the push to build an inclusive, and more equitable world, where all are respected, treated equally, and provided equal opportunities regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.</p>
<p>Pride Month recognizes the impact that LGBTQIA+ individuals have had on equality and civil rights locally, statewide, nationally, and globally. It aims to increase the awareness of and eliminate violence toward LGBTQIA+ people. Pride&#8217;s origin dates back more than a half-century with protests led largely by transgender women of color who confronted discrimination and police brutality.</p>
<p>There is a clear throughline of Pride's origin in protesting discrimination and police violence to today&#8217;s urgent demands for equality and equity, and protection for communities of color. We stand in solidarity with these communities and their intersectional fight for justice.</p>
<p>Throughout this month we will be releasing stories on our campus newscenter that focus on our students who have been doing research and advocacy in this area. We will also be highlighting the new University of California policy, announced this past fall, on gender recognition and lived names. University information systems now offer at least three equally recognized gender options: woman, man, and nonbinary. Also, any individual entering into an academic or employment relationship with the University of California is permitted to indicate a lived name, to be used in the University of California system in all settings and situations that do not require a person's legal name. This policy has a three-year implementation period, and we expect to be fully compliant by Dec. 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Our commitment to protect the fundamental rights of the LGBTQIA+ community is crucial as we see an increase in state measures that seek to roll back basic human rights, many targeting transgender people. Thirty-plus states have introduced more than 100 bills that aim to curb the rights of trans people, with LGBTQIA+ advocacy groups calling 2021 an unfortunate, record-breaking year for such legislation. We stand opposed to all these efforts to restrict basic human rights.</p>
<p>The bills and the message they send have devastating consequences. One study estimates that LGBTQIA+ individuals comprise up to 40 percent of the total unaccompanied homeless youth population. Nationally and internationally, countless numbers of people are threatened and sometimes killed for being or perceived as being a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. It was just five years ago this month that a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that police labeled a hate crime.</p>
<p>These and other discriminatory and violent actions against the LGBTQIA+ community show the threat members of this community face daily. We must be vocal in our support.</p>
<p>We are proud that our <a href="https://queer.ucsc.edu/index.html">Lionel Cant&#250; Queer Center</a> has a strong, visible presence on campus, working tirelessly to connect, retain, and sustain queer and trans students, staff, faculty, and alumni. The center provides vital programming, workshops, and critical dialogues that challenge cisheteronormative understandings of gender and sexuality, and it celebrates LGBTQIA+ community members. Students can reach out to the center if they are in need of emergency funds, or even gender-affirming clothing like chest binders, and the Cant&#250; will connect them with support. Later this month, the center is holding UCSC&#8217;s 23rd annual Lavender Graduation, a celebration for graduating queer and trans Slugs and their loved ones.</p>

The exhibit, curated by UCSC&#8217;s Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History, explores what nature connection means to a wide variety of naturalists and draws on this perspective to envision a more diverse and inclusive future.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit team interviewed nearly 100 community members as part of their development process, and photos, quotes, artwork, and diagrams throughout the exhibit reflect themes from those interviews. A few featured naturalists include Valentin Lopez, current chair of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band; the late Fred McPherson, a key figure in the natural history of the Santa Cruz Mountain Bioregion; and Julie Sidel, a longtime parks interpreter in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit also spotlights the next generation of naturalists, including those being trained by the Norris Center and UC Santa Cruz. Justin Luong, a Ph.D. student and member of the exhibit&#8217;s development team, said that one of the central themes the exhibit conveys is the need to rethink what the word &#8220;naturalist&#8221; means, including who can become a naturalist and how.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a younger, more diverse group of up-and-coming naturalists who generally tend to be more people of color and more LGBTQ folks,&#8221; Luong said. &#8220;Another thing we want people to take away is that you don&#8217;t need to be an expert to be a naturalist, and you don&#8217;t need any type of expensive, specialized equipment. All you need to do is enjoy nature, be curious, and want to learn more.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look-Act-Inspire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibition is open for in-person visits Thursday through Sunday until June 27th at the San Lorenzo Valley Museum's Belardi Gallery, located in Felton. Museum hours are Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday from 1&#8211;4 p.m. and Friday from 4&#8211;7 p.m. Reservations are not required. To schedule a private tour, call the museum at 831-338-8382.

<p>This draft plan was developed by the Office of the President based on input from diverse groups of University of California stakeholders, reports from the campus safety task forces, participants in the campus safety symposia held earlier this spring, and numerous conversations with students, faculty, staff, and administrators.</p>
<p><strong>I encourage you to share feedback, questions or comments on the Presidential Campus Safety Plan through the 30-day period from June 1 to June 30 by <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sending an email to pco@ucsc.edu</a>.</strong> Comments from our campus will be collated and provided to the Office of the President for integration with the systemwide feedback. This feedback will be considered in advance of President Drake issuing a final UC-wide plan this summer.</p>
<p>Separately, the University of California has been engaged in a review and public comment period for the systemwide policing and administrative policies, sometimes referred to as the Gold Book. Comments were due by May 31, 2021. The review was required by UC policy, previous task force recommendations, and recent state legislative changes. These are two separate public comment periods for two different documents. It is important to note the review process does not preclude UC from making significant, long-term changes to the Gold Book through the Presidential Campus Safety Plan.</p>
<p>This draft Presidential Campus Safety Plan for the system does not take the place of the ongoing work on our campus to create lasting change. I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the UCSC <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/community-advisory-board.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622737154156000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzuMnQoS29a14vpW-pkHJIkUXusA" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/community-advisory-board.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Campus Safety Community Advisory Board</a> (CAB) as they are finalized and to communicating broadly about the work of our campus in response to the CAB&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
<p>President Drake and I send our deep thanks to everyone for their valuable contributions to this important ongoing work, both at the system level and specifically at UC Santa Cruz. We especially appreciate your engagement during this time with multiple competing priorities and deadlines.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ce82557e80727017480ce7264008412b"><name>soc-sci-awards-2021</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Social Sciences Division celebrates outstanding students</title><summary>The Social Sciences Division is recognizing 21 students for excellence in scholarship and research.</summary><start-date>1622617200000</start-date><path>/2021/06/soc-sci-awards-2021</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/soc-sci-awards-2021</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1622667318595</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1626368296659</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Anthropology</value><value>Politics</value><value>Sociology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value><value>Psychology</value><value>Community Studies</value><value>Education</value><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/2021-student-awards-banner-vertical.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/2021-student-awards-banner-vertical.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>2021-student-awards-banner-vertical.jpg</name><display-name>2021-student-awards-banner-vertical.jpg</display-name><file-size>125172</file-size><width>341</width><height>511</height></image><image-alt>A grouping of headshots of student awardees</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/awards-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/awards-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>awards-80.jpg</name><display-name>awards-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>28853</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As spring quarter drew to a close, the Division of Social Sciences recognized excellence in scholarship and research through its annual student awards ceremony.

<p>The Simons Investigators program is intended to support outstanding theoretical scientists in their most productive years, when they are establishing creative new research directions, providing leadership to the field, and effectively mentoring junior scientists.</p>
<p>Fortney&#8217;s research <a href="https://jfortney.sites.ucsc.edu/">focuses on understanding the atmospheres, interiors, and thermal evolution of planets</a>, including exoplanets that orbit distant stars as well as the planets in our own solar system. He develops numerical models to explore many aspects of the physics of planets, from rocky worlds to gas giants. This work has provided a framework for understanding the atmospheres of exoplanets, their interior structure and thermal evolution, as well as physical processes like &#8220;helium rain&#8221; deep within Saturn.</p>
<p>Fortney often works closely with observers in interpreting the spectra of exoplanets to better understand their physics, chemistry, and clues to their formation. He directs the <a href="https://owl.ucsc.edu/">Other Worlds Laboratory (OWL)</a>, a UCSC research initiative that brings together researchers in several departments and features a unique summer visitors program.</p>
<p>Fortney is well known for his contributions to the understanding of gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the so-called &#8220;hot Jupiter&#8221; exoplanets that orbit close to their host stars. He has also begun to broaden his research to include rocky terrestrial planets, as well as the cool, faint stars known as M stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;M stars are the most common stars in the sky, and some of the models we developed for hot planet atmospheres we can also apply to these cool stars,&#8221; Fortney said. &#8220;Some hot Jupiters are actually hotter than the coolest stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Simons Investigator funding will give him more time to focus on these new research directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have focused a lot on giant planets, and now my group is diversifying in both directions, looking at smaller planets as well as larger objects, the smallest stars,&#8221; Fortney said. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to build a group that&#8217;s diverse in the sorts of problems we can tackle, and this award is very helpful to make that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the deployment of new telescopes and instruments, such as the soon-to-be-launched James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers are looking forward to a wealth of new exoplanet observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this quest to understand the rapid influx of data, Jonathan Fortney&#8217;s technical skills and expertise are immeasurable assets to the community,&#8221; said Douglas N.C. Lin, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. &#8220;His versatility and breadth will enable him to grasp opportunities and embrace challenges brought forth by the anticipated and serendipitous discoveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each year, the Simons Foundation requests nominations from a targeted list of institutions in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland for the Simons Investigator programs in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, and computer science. The Simons Investigators are appointed for an initial period of five years and receive research support of $100,000 per year.</p>
<p>Fortney was awarded the 2020 Paolo Farinella Prize from the Europlanet Society for his contributions to the understanding of giant planets, as well as the 2010 Harold C. Urey Prize in Planetary Science from the American Astronomical Society. He earned his B.S. in physics at Iowa State University and Ph.D. in planetary science at the University of Arizona. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2008.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0f488c580727017480ce72671661f1f"><name>urbanski-phd-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Feminist studies Ph.D. student receives Institute for Citizens &amp; Scholars fellowship</title><summary>Claire Urbanski, a Ph.D. candidate in feminist studies, has been named a Charlotte W.

Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellow by the <em><strong><a href="https://citizensandscholars.org">Institute for Citizens &amp; Scholars</a></strong></em> (formerly the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation).</span></p>
<p><span>The Newcombe Fellowship is the largest and most prestigious award for Ph.D. candidates in the humanities and social sciences addressing questions of ethical and religious values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>It is designed to encourage original and significant study and also help Ph.D. candidates complete their dissertation work in a timely manner.&#160;</span>Each fellow receives a 12-month award of $27,500 to support their final year of writing.</p>
<p><span>Urbanski&#8217;s dissertation, <i>On Sacred and Stolen Lands: Desecration and Spiritual Violence as United States Settler Colonialism</i>, examines &#8220;the consolidation and reproduction of United States empire through the desecration of Indigenous sacred sites and attendant modes of colonial spiritual violence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>As a public fellow of The Humanities Institute at UCSC in 2016, she spent her summer working at The Arizona State Museum, one of the nation&#8217;s largest state-operated archaeological repositories for excavated objects, artifacts, and human remains.The repository handles Native American Graves and Repatriation Act claims and protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Many archeological digs conducted in Arizona entailed the excavation of Indigenous burial sites,&#8221; Urbanski noted after completing her THI fellowship. &#8220;The ASM spends a great deal of time going through past dig project materials. I spent most of my time cataloguing and screening archeological and archival materials for funerary objects and human remains so that they could be repatriated to their descendants or affiliated communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/humanities-public-fellows.html"><strong><i>THI Public Fellows</i></strong></a> program provides an opportunity for humanities doctoral students to participate in research, programming, communications, and fundraising at a wide variety of non-profit organizations, cultural institutions, and companies. The aim of the fellowships is to enable students to apply and expand their skills in a non-academic setting while engaged in graduate study.</span></p>
<p><span>The Newcombe Dissertation Fellowship is an integral part of the Institute for Citizens &amp; Scholars portfolio in higher education. Over 1,200 Newcombe Fellows have been named since the first round of competition in 1981.</span></p>
<p><span>Fellows from early years of the program are now senior faculty members at major research universities and selective liberal arts colleges, curators and directors at significant scholarly archives, and leaders and policymakers at nonprofit organizations and in cabinet-level government agencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In the past decade, national honors such as the MacArthur Fellowship, Pulitzer Prize in History, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences have been awarded to more than a dozen Newcombe Fellows.</span>&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/humanities-public-fellows.html</url><title>New program helps humanities grad students consider work in the public sphere</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d35b146e80727017480ce726f0f311b9"><name>research-related-travel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revised approval process for essential research travel</title><summary>We write today to provide an update on research-related travel.

We understand that some graduate students and employees of UC Santa Cruz may need to travel to enable critical research activities. Although the United States continues to see decreases in new COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and an increase in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 continues to present a global health risk that must be taken seriously, particularly in the context of international travel.</p>

With this change, we are updating our policies on domestic and international research travel. We urge all prospective travelers to first consult the CDC Guidance, and <strong>we want to highlight that the CDC recommends delay of travel until travelers are fully vaccinated</strong>.</p>
<p>At this time, travel will only be permitted for critical research activities. By definition, critical research activities meet these three criteria: (1) The travel is essential to the survival or long-term viability of significant research activity or academic work; (2) The research activity is a substantial component of the petitioner&#8217;s academic or professional work at UCSC; and (3) There are no viable alternatives to travel.</p>
<p>All research-related travelers, whether domestic or international, are required to review and complete the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/field-research/%23covid&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622833591242000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0TzqGB5_j-_kKmUQoiw2yxLm0wQ" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/field-research/#covid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19 Research Travel Checklist</a> provided by the EH&amp;S Field Research Safety program.

This month, they&#8217;ll graduate within two days of each other&#8212;Desi with a degree in cognitive science at UC Santa Cruz, and Daniel with an electrical engineering degree from UC Irvine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ascencio has learned to make adjustments in his life. His parents, immigrants from El Salvador who were refugees from its civil war in the 1980s, had high expectations for him to go to college, as his older brother and sister had done. But when he was a sophomore in high school, he failed a math class, and his grade-point average plummeted.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was the first experience in which I struggled with something that only I could fix,&#8221; Ascencio said. &#8220;I had to learn to advocate for myself, correct my time-management skills and study habits, and prioritize what I wanted to accomplish.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was able to improve his GPA and get accepted at UC Santa Cruz, declaring bioengineering as his major. But halfway through his undergraduate years, he encountered another downfall, and his grades started to slip. With the help of mentors, he was able to work at a research lab where he learned coding, and he realized his passions for neuroscience and computer science. Then he was accepted as a summer research assistant for the STEM Diversity Programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both of these environments were pivotal to my finding the confidence to explore my interests as a student and as a scientist,&#8221; Ascencio said. &#8220;I changed my major and became more interested in my classes and everything around me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;d been active in The Social Club, a DJ collective on campus that celebrated people of color through dance and self-expression. That helped him gain experience with event planning and programming, which led to his role as logistics lead for GraceHacks, a group started by students, like Saniya Doshi (College Nine '22, computer science), to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to be in an environment where I could motivate and help other people in underrepresented groups to reach their potential,&#8221; Ascencio said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the research lab and STEM Diversity were doing for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now? After his virtual graduation, he&#8217;ll enter the Computational and Neurosystems Ph.D. program at California Institute of Technology. Always learning.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d42d952d80727017480ce72613333437"><name>mahmoodi-evanjelin-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Evanjelin Mahmoodi </title><summary>Evanjelin Mahmoodi knew she was interested in STEM fields when she arrived at UC Santa Cruz but soon discovered she especially liked mathematics.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evanjelin Mahmoodi knew she was interested in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) when she arrived at UC Santa Cruz but soon discovered she especially liked mathematics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she&#8217;s graduating with a double major in mathematics and computer science, one of the few women students in those departments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not very diverse, we have a long way to go,&#8221; said Mahmoodi, 22, the first in her family to attend a four-year university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer she will work at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., in computer science after winning a prestigious NIH fellowship that helped pay for her undergraduate work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also is wrapping up an internship at NASA&#8217;s Marshall Space Flight Center, where she worked on developing different virtual reality experiences. Another project involved network programming so employees at different NASA centers can join and interact with each other in the same virtual environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahmoodi, who was born in Iran of Armenian heritage, moved to the United States at age 10, and grew up in the Los Angeles area as an only child.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She especially credits her success to programs at UC Santa Cruz such as the MESA Engineering Program (MEP) and support groups for first-generation and STEM students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s been one of my favorite highlights,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a really supportive space; you can get help to catch up with students who have more privilege or opportunities.&#8221; She said the programs were a big help in applying for scholarships and graduate programs, and in professional development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a community of other like-minded students is so important. It helps you succeed throughout school and beyond school as well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Having the mentors I had in MEP and STEM diversity&#8212;helpful and supportive mentors&#8212;really made a difference.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahmoodi said she hopes eventually to complete a Ph.D. in computer science. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d434b73680727017480ce726583d71fc"><name>zarate-mccoy-jeven-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jeven Zarate-McCoy</title><summary>In his four years at UCSC, Jeven Zarate-McCoy has served in various lead roles and officer positions with the Game Design and Arts Collaboration student group and is capping his final year as president. </summary><start-date>1623085200000</start-date><display-name>Jeven Zarate-McCoy</display-name><path>/2021/06/zarate-mccoy-jeven-commencement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/zarate-mccoy-jeven-commencement</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1622762895128</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623089469697</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>commencement</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/zarate-mccoy-jeven-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/zarate-mccoy-jeven-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zarate-mccoy-jeven-1.jpg</name><display-name>zarate-mccoy-jeven-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>37815</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Jeven Zarate-McCoy (Porter '21, art and design: games and playable media)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/zarate-mccoy-jeven-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/zarate-mccoy-jeven-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zarate-mccoy-jeven-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>zarate-mccoy-jeven-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2175</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jeven Zarate-McCoy (Porter '21, art and design: games and playable media)</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jeven Zarate-McCoy (Porter '21, art and design: games and playable media)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Porter '21, art and design: games and playable media
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a kid, Jeven Zarate-McCoy liked playing computer games </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he wanted to be a writer. As he got older and began looking toward college, he looked for a school where he could learn how to create games&#8212;a mix of writing and design. His parents were supportive, he remembers&#8212;they just didn&#8217;t think such a place existed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always goal-oriented, he set himself a goal to create games, chose UC Santa Cruz, and has been relentless in achieving his ambition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I basically threw myself out there,&#8221; said Zarate-McCoy, 22. &#8220;You have to do all you can do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He joined the Game Design and Arts (GDA) Collaboration student group right after arriving on campus and has stayed involved ever since. A small group of UC Santa Cruz students founded the GDA in 2015. Today it has more than 100 members and promotes networking and skill-sharing between artists, musicians, programmers, and game designers. The group creates student opportunities for professional development, mentorship, and travel to game conferences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his four years at UCSC, Zarate-McCoy has served in various lead roles and officer positions with the GDA and is capping his final year as president. Digital Arts and New Media staff credit him with &#8220;an outstanding job of keeping this important club flowing smoothly and contributing to the positive social culture of the club and our major during this fully remote year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zarate-McCoy said a key benefit of the GDA is bringing together the talents of a wide cross section of students who may not necessarily be game majors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So many people outside of games who are important to the field,&#8221; he said, mentioning one particular student who contributed &#8220;great art, great music, and she's a biology major!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zarate-McCoy grew up in Elk Grove, Calif., with two older brothers and a younger sister, and has known what he wanted to do since junior high school. He doesn&#8217;t doesn&#8217;t see himself as &#8220;particularly skilled,&#8221; he said, but will grant that he is confident and focused on his goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His next step is to land a job with one of the big game makers.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonah Gertz admits that there were times in the past four years when he tried to choose between his two academic passions: intensive history and music. In the end, he could not force himself to make this impossible choice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was hard to justify any such change when I was surrounded by so many different opportunities to grow as both a historian and musician,&#8221; Gertz said. &#8220;I guess, at the end of the day, I put a lot on my plate because it was offered at the buffet, but I definitely would not have been able to finish it all without the help of my friends at my table.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following two passions at once was not easy for him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Balancing my diverse academic interests was a constant exercise in self-regulation and, frankly, a fairly exhausting one at that,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the assistance and encouragement of faculty mentors made him realize that he was taking the right path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gertz was thrilled when two of his academic heroes, East Asian Studies Program Director Noriko Aso and Distinguished Professor of History Gail Hershatter, agreed to advise him when he first proposed his thesis, &#8220;Japan and Methamphetamine: the Afterlife of Occupation and the Hiropon Age,&#8221; examining the historical development of Japanese narco-culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When they signed on to guide me in my thesis-writing process, it amplified my passion for the project by a factor of 10,&#8221; he said. "My development as a researcher, writer, and historian over the course of the last year can largely be attributed to their diligence in mentoring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the research process, Gertz was surprised by the negligence of the post&#8211;World War II occupation government in protecting the national health of Japan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Simple legislative action in the immediate post-war could have drastically curbed the effects of Japan's first major narcotics epidemic,&#8221; Gertz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a different note, as a musician in UCSC's Electronic Music program, his greatest highlight was working on the soundtrack for Love Heist Romeo, a student game project helmed by the most talented game design students he&#8217;d ever met.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the course of co-composing the music, I have received unparalleled creative support and grown so much as a musician under the guidance of both my development teammates and UCSC faculty,&#8221; said Gertz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he loved the process so much that he decided to seek a career in the field and is pursuing a masters of science in sound and music for interactive games next year at Leeds Beckett University in England.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that he&#8217;s about to say goodbye to campus and travel to another country, he can see how much he changed in the past four years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I first came to UCSC, I had interests, but little concrete ambition. During my time as a Banana Slug, I have been taught by inspiring professors, met incredible people, and spent so much time aimlessly walking around redwoods," Gertz said. "I can't exactly say how it happened, but some combination of those three things provided me with a really solid framework to plan the rest of my life.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4472c3480727017480ce726c273863a"><name>chu-joslyn-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Joslyn Chu </title><summary>Joslyn Chu loved psychology before arriving at UCSC and planned to follow that path.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joslyn Chu&#8217;s one-quarter research assistantship working on arts journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacific Arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew into a full year because of her hard work and dedication.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journal is published by the Pacific Arts Association, an international organization based at UC Santa Cruz that is devoted to the study of the arts of Oceania (Aboriginal Australia and the Pacific Islands).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chu loved psychology before arriving at UCSC and planned to follow that path. But after a couple of classes she soon fell in love with the issues of Oceania and climate change, particularly how &#8220;people in Oceania are using art as a form of activism to spread awareness of effects of climate change,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;It really impacted me, blew that spark into a bigger fire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She first thought history of art and visual culture (HAVC) would be a minor but realized that completing a double major would provide her with more opportunities to study what she loves. She&#8217;ll continue her work in Oceania art after graduation, winning a scholarship to help fund her research project in Hawaiian museums this summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chu, 22, grew up in Los Angeles, one of eight children between the ages of 29 and 5. (She&#8217;s third youngest.) She first visited UCSC after her admission offer arrived.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once I stepped on campus I fell in love,&#8221; she recalls. &#8220;The connection with nature; people were so nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really do love this school,&#8221; she said. Sadly, the past year and a half have been spent in distance learning from her home in San Jose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In psychology, Chu&#8217;s focus is on developmental psychology, and she plans to attend graduate school for either a Ph.D or Psy.D. She aspires to become a clinician and use art therapy to help children.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My goal is to help young children who experience trauma. One way to use art therapy is to help them express themselves if they are unable to otherwise,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her advice for new students is to &#8220;be adaptive, not be too set on one path,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Take a variety of classes, follow what interests you. Find what is your passion.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just might discover something new, she said, like a love for Oceania.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7b7c91580727017480ce726053762c5"><name>ready-set-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus update: Ready, set, commencement</title><summary>This entire academic year has been a unique experience.

Each Slug graduate who has registered &#8212; that&#8217;s about 3,000 of you! &#8212; will take part in a traditional stage crossing on the East Field. Graduates of the Class of 2020 have been invited as well. The Slug Crossing will be livestreamed, with a link posted on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsVpWZ_LBs-y8HxkQBOoL1I0CPGw" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website </a>just before 9 a.m. June 11, when the first Slugs cross the stage.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff volunteers are still needed for Slug Crossing to help make sure everything runs smoothly! Volunteers will help set up signage, prepare the space for the weekend, and clean up once the weekend is over. Consider <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c44aeae2ea3fec70-2021&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-6vMuY5tauHCeROhxkT38aRs0mQ" href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c44aeae2ea3fec70-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank">signing up to volunteer</a>. Your time and assistance would be greatly appreciated by me, the organizers, and especially by our graduates!</p>
<p>I am so grateful to everyone involved in supporting this year&#8217;s virtual commencements and Slug Crossing for their hard work and creativity in finding new ways to celebrate our graduates and honor their achievements. I look forward to celebrating the accomplishments of our students and welcoming them into our community of more than 140,000 UCSC alumni!</p>
<h3>Expanded Summer Session a boon for students</h3>
<p>While many eyes are already on the start of the next academic year, our Summer Session organizers are deep in preparations for a busy few months before we get to fall. Last year saw a record-breaking 38 percent increase in enrollment over 2019, resulting in the highest summer enrollment in campus history! There was a big jump in lower-division students taking online classes, and we experienced double the typical enrollment of newly admitted frosh and transfers. We anticipate maintaining those high levels of enrollment this summer.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://summer.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQXIKnf50SJcqMHnJAbHUbJmZDkA" href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://online.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFffXTdHa1hBFWzR0snx7oyXva3zA" href="https://online.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Online Education</a> have funded, developed, and offered more and more online courses, which have been a big hit with students. Departments and colleges have simultaneously expanded their offerings to help students make progress toward their academic goals. The switch to remote instruction (even labs, studio arts, and service learning) has provided class accessibility we hadn&#8217;t fully realized our Slugs desired. Thanks to innovative faculty, supportive academic advisers, and dedicated staff we are proud to offer more than 400 remote classes for our summertime Slugs. Our expanded summer offerings give students an opportunity to get a head start, work toward a minor or double major, or graduate early and have had a direct impact on our three-year graduation rate, which has risen to the highest level in the University of California system, tying us with UC Irvine. This is a positive, student-serving development for our campus that deserves recognition.</p>
<p>Though we will not have the same number of camps and conferences we usually see during summer, we are hosting some programs in person. Other programs, such as our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sip.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP2CacD4ZaCxQKSI_LGDMntPwJuw" href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Science Internship Program</a> and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cosmos.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFD3suI1qWQW9cSyZUYfIlyeF6WNQ" href="https://cosmos.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COSMOS</a> will be remote.</p>
<h3>Vaccination guidelines for fall still being developed</h3>
<p>Many of you have questions about the proposed UC Office of the President policy mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing any UC facilities beginning this fall. The policy is still being finalized, and we will pass along additional information as soon as we have it. In the meantime, UCOP has created Q&amp;A documents for both <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/student-faqs-for-university-of-california-proposed-covid-19-vaccination-policy-4-22-21.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4nyltkIZbE2HJtwbT9pUSofG9VA" href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/student-faqs-for-university-of-california-proposed-covid-19-vaccination-policy-4-22-21.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">students</a> and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/employee-faqs-for-university-of-california-proposed-vaccination-policy-4-22-21.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsPZ-MLOyjSqVa9--5u9YtkAJTKw" href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/employee-faqs-for-university-of-california-proposed-vaccination-policy-4-22-21.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a> to answer questions you might have.</p>

<p>Hopefully you have seen the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/images/presidential-campus-safety-plan_draft-for-distribution.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5O26WClvZWZJuuBUWEpdMCoHVww" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/images/presidential-campus-safety-plan_draft-for-distribution.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">draft Presidential Campus Safety Plan</a> that was <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/campus-safety-plan.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4E8H3MRB2gbHpOelJoyVuvQWGQA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/campus-safety-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sent to all members of our campus community</a> earlier this week. The proposal, from the UC Office of the President, lays a foundation for transforming UC&#8217;s culture, policies, and practices to create campus communities where all feel equally welcomed, respected, and protected from harm.</p>
<p>I encourage you to share feedback, questions or comments on the plan during the 30-day period, which extends to June 30, by <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sending an email to pco@ucsc.edu</a>. Comments from our community will be collated and provided to the Office of the President. This feedback will be considered in advance of President Drake issuing a final UC-wide plan this summer.</p>
<p>This draft Presidential Campus Safety Plan for the system does not supplant the ongoing work on our campus to create lasting change. I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the UCSC Campus Safety Community Advisory Board as they are finalized, then communicating broadly with all of our campus constituencies.</p>
<h3>Saluting student achievement</h3>
<p>Finally, as we are in <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622904040741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbS2Yfd5WCZWiK77uxKEPF6ZrHXg" href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Achievement Week</a>, I&#8217;d like to offer my congratulations to the many students across all departments, divisions and colleges who have been recognized this past week for their extraordinary research, scholarship, leadership, athletic pursuits, and other endeavors. There are simply too many award winners to list them all here, but please know that I am exceedingly proud of our creative, talented, hard-working student body.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her stunning videos shows a puma walking along a coastal trail with two eager cubs. Setting up her trail cameras and taking these pictures requires patience, perseverance, focus, hard work, and striving to achieve an elusive goal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those same qualities served Pierini well on her long backpacking trips. They also helped her hold the course during her steep, epic hike toward a UC Santa Cruz diploma, an educational path she completed in spite of a 27-year-long delay and a devastating wildfire that turned a lifetime's worth of belongings into ash.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierini entered UC Santa Cruz as a transfer student from Cabrillo College in 1994 and delved into linguistics, but she had to withdraw later that year because she had to tend to pressing family matters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the campus, she returned to Cabrillo to get her associate&#8217;s degree in horticulture, and found work as a gardener at UC Santa Cruz. But unfinished goals were never far from her mind.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years she stayed in touch with Linguistics Professor James McCloskey (now emeritus).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He told me, &#8216;You need to finish. You&#8217;re good.' I thought, &#8216;Well, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good,' but I started to have my doubts. Did I miss my chance? I could have been a contender!&#8221; said Pierini with a laugh, quoting the famous Marlon Brando line from the 1954 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Waterfront.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting 12 years ago, she worked as a groundskeeper at Kresge College. But her husband and daughter&#8212;&#8220;my biggest fans"&#8212;kept encouraging her to re-enroll at UC Santa Cruz. In 2019, she took the big leap, returning to the classroom to finish her degree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first she was so intimidated, she audited her linguistics classes, but she soon found her footing as a returning student. All those years away from school, and all her life experience, gave her renewed focus and direction.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I absolutely loved it," she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she grew closer to her goal, life had another unwelcome surprise for her. The devastating </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/czufireaftermathstory.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZU August Lightning Complex fires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 2020 destroyed her family home, forcing her to move from Davenport to another location up the coast. Still, she pressed on with her work. Now that it&#8217;s all coming to a conclusion, her emotions are mixed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s good to finish what I started,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;On the other hand, I loved working on problems with other students, going to the library, figuring things out on the blackboard, talking to my professors, and always having a goal ahead of me. I already miss it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7d402fa80727017480ce726ca52b5fd"><name>cosmic-axion-background</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Axions could be the fossil of the universe researchers have been waiting for</title><summary>A new study suggests finding the hypothetical particles known as axions could mean finding out for the first time what happened in the universe a second after the Big Bang.</summary><keywords>Jeff Dror</keywords><start-date>1623074400000</start-date><display-name>Axions could be the fossil of the universe researchers have been waiting for</display-name><path>/2021/06/cosmic-axion-background</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/cosmic-axion-background</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1622823666398</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623166843583</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Motoko Kakubayashi, Kavli IPMU</name><title></title><phone/><email>motoko.kakubayashi@ipmu.jp</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/haystac-273.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/haystac-273.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haystac-273.jpg</name><display-name>haystac-273.jpg</display-name><file-size>59094</file-size><width>273</width><height>252</height></image><image-alt>photo of HAYSTAC components</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/haystac-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/haystac-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haystac-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>haystac-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21642</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>photo of HAYSTAC components</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Experiments such as HAYSTAC (above) and MADMAX (below) could find evidence of axions from the early universe.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/madmax-273.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/madmax-273.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>madmax-273.jpg</name><display-name>madmax-273.jpg</display-name><file-size>57773</file-size><width>273</width><height>235</height></image><image-alt>photo of MADMAX equipment</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new study suggests finding the hypothetical particles known as axions could mean finding out for the first time what happened in the universe a second after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>How far back into the universe&#8217;s past can we look today? In the electromagnetic spectrum, observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) allow us to see back almost 14 billion years to when the universe cooled sufficiently for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen. The CMB has taught us an inordinate amount about the evolution of the cosmos, but photons in the CMB were released 400,000 years after the Big Bang, making it extremely challenging to learn about the history of the universe prior to this epoch.</p>
<p>To open a new window, a trio of theoretical researchers looked beyond photons and into the realm of axions, hypothetical particles that may have been emitted in the first second of the universe&#8217;s history. They published their findings June 7 in the journal <em>Physical Review D</em>. The authors are Jeff Dror, now a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://scipp.science.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)</a> and previously at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and UC Berkeley; Hitoshi Murayama, MacAdams Professor of Physics at UC Berkeley, senior faculty scientist at LBNL, and principal investigator at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) in Japan; and Nicholas Rodd, Miller Research Fellow at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In their paper, the researchers suggest the possibility of searching for an axion analogue of the CMB, a so-called Cosmic axion Background or CaB. While hypothetical, there are many reasons to suspect that the axion could exist in our universe.</p>
<p>For one, axions are a generic prediction of string theory, one of today&#8217;s best hopes for a theory of quantum gravity. The existence of an axion could further help resolve the longstanding puzzle of why we have yet to measure an electric dipole moment for the neutron, an issue more formally known as the &#8220;strong CP problem&#8221;. More recently, the axion has become a promising candidate for dark matter, and as a consequence researchers are rapidly searching for axion dark matter.</p>
<p>In the new paper, the researchers point out that as experimentalists develop more sensitive instruments to search for dark matter, they may stumble upon another sign of axions in the form of the CaB. But because the CaB shares similar properties with dark-matter axions, there is a risk the experiments would throw the CaB signal out as noise.</p>
<p>Finding the CaB at one of these instruments would be a double discovery. Not only would it confirm the existence of the axion, but researchers worldwide would immediately have a new fossil from the early universe. Depending on how the CaB was produced, researchers could learn about various different aspects of the universe&#8217;s evolution never possible before.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have proposed is that, by changing the way current experiments analyze data, we may be able to search for left-over axions from the early universe. Then, we might be able to learn about the origin of dark matter, phase transition, or inflation at the beginning of the universe. There are already experimental groups who have shown interest in our proposal, and I hope we can find out something new about the early universe that wasn&#8217;t known before,&#8221; Murayama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evolution of the universe can produce axions with a characteristic energy distribution. By detecting the energy density of the universe currently made up of axions, experiments such as MADMAX, HAYSTAC, ADMX, and DMRadio could give us answers to some of the most important puzzles in cosmology, such as: How hot did our universe get? What is the nature of dark matter? Did our universe undergo a period of rapid expansion known as inflation? And was there ever a cosmic phase transition?&#8221; said Dror.</p>
<p>The new study provides reason to be excited about the axion dark matter program. Even if dark matter is not made of axions, these instruments may provide an image of the universe when it was less than a second old.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d80e52af80727017480ce726c73cf89b"><name>lopez-montserrat-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Montserrat Lopez </title><summary>Montserrat Lopez dedicated her college career to art, outreach, activism, and giving back to the communities that have sustained her.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montserrat Lopez dedicated her college career to art, outreach, activism, and giving back to the communities that have sustained her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her far-ranging goals and ambitious course of study, Lopez had not a minute to lose when she transferred to UC Santa Cruz as a junior last year. She had so much she wished to accomplish, and so little time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the most of her schedule, she made an appointment with a Latin American and Latino studies (LALS) adviser to put together an academic plan to make sure she met all her goals and requirements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in spite of her rigorous studies and full days, Lopez made time to become an LALS peer adviser, helping other students face the challenges of academic life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Outreach is very important to me, especially as a first-generation student," she said. "It brings me a lot of joy to work with other students, help them achieve their goals, and answer their questions and concerns."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez also interned for the Research Center for the Americas' Human Rights Investigation Lab, a campus initiative investigating human rights issues using open-source investigative tools. In addition, she co-hosted a community arts night for her fellow undergraduates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I love creating art and wanted to create space for other artists to join the community and create together," Lopez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her artworks was published in the student-run art magazine </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TWANAS,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and showcased in a campus festival dedicated to art and solidarity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from these academic and artistic pursuits, Lopez delved into an independent research project, exploring the history of "La Loter&#237;a," a popular Mexican game of chance with European roots, and with a strong artistic component, with elaborate and colorful images on the cards.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from her extremely busy schedule, Lopez faced a complication she never could have predicted: "It's a bummer that I was only at UC Santa Cruz six months before the pandemic happened, and I came back home."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez completed her coursework via Zoom at her parents' house in her hometown of Pittsburg, Calif.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now that she is about to graduate, she is already looking forward to the next step. She hopes to continue her work as a digital investigator for human rights with a strong focus on Latin America as well as Latinos in the United States.&#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Nabeela Ariqat's family moved from Jordan to the United States, they hoped to escape from turmoil. The reality was much more complicated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My mother moved here to meet up with my father who was here via a green card," said Ariqat, who was only 3 when she arrived in the United States. "My mom also had the American dream in her mind. She thought everything would be OK when we were in America, which wasn't the case."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatefully, the family arrived in the U.S. one month before the 9/11 terror attacks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We were faced with discrimination and hate on every corner [after 9/11] since my mother wore the hijab," Ariqat said. "We also did not have a stable living situation here so it was very hard for my mom. It was a difficult transition, especially since none of us spoke English."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariqat, a first-generation college student, hoped for a new beginning at UC Santa Cruz, which she attended in part because "I felt like I could be who I was," she said. "My first year of college I was excited when I was placed in Oakes and saw that there were many students who looked like me, pursuing a degree in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was initially discouraged when she saw how many of her peers dropped their STEM studies. And her family's financial situation almost cut her dream short.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"During my first quarter my family got evicted from our home and I needed to make money fast to help out more," Ariqat said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariqat had to increase her hours working at an In-N-Out Burger fast-food restaurant to cover the family's expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the interventions of two caring mentors, campus STEM Diversity Programs&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director Yulianna Ortega (Merrill '09, Latin American and Latino studies and biology)&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Grant Hartzog, restored her hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hartzog helped her apply for multiple scholarships and plan out her classwork at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Not only did he help me academically, but he also helped me understand the imposter syndrome ingrained in me," Ariqat said. "He helped me see that I was doing great even with working 30&#8211;35 hours a week with 15&#8211;22 units of classwork."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an honors fellow in the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) Program, she had hands-on experience working in laboratory settings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ariqat also took the time to help other first-generation students trying to find their way, serving as a STEM diversity peer tutor, secretary of Planned Parenthood Generation Action at UCSC, and president of the UC Santa Cruz chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariqat made it her mission to supply students with any resources they needed, and to help them feel safe speaking out about their experiences at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, Ariqat is working in the laboratory of Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, studying the effects of DNA damage on the lactation process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She plans to take two ambitious "gap years" between her undergraduate and graduate work, researching in the laboratory of UC San Francisco Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics Martin Kampmann, before applying to graduate school in a medical scientist training program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she's eager for her next step, she will miss her STEM Diversity Programs and her whole SACNAS family. But the thing she'll miss most is walking out of her dorm, or the Biomedical Science Building, and finding herself in a peaceful redwood forest, reflecting on her journey. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d82bfcae80727017480ce72631e643ce"><name>hidy-nicholas-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nicholas Hidy </title><summary>It’s tough being a performing arts major when all the performing arts spaces are shut down.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the predicament in which Nick Hidy found himself in early 2020. Hidy plays the French horn and trombone, and was a key member of several UCSC Music Department ensembles.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All his work depended on being on stage with an audience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;COVID wiped that out in totality. Adapting was extremely difficult,&#8221; Hidy said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as they say, out of adversity comes innovation, and that&#8217;s what happened, &#8220;especially at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; says Hidy, 20, who will graduate with a bachelor of music degree in music performance and is headed to the University of Washington for at least a master's degree in music performance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz has been a great springboard to graduate school,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidy misses performing live but noted that he and other students were able to create new </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/brianbaumbusch/isotropes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">musical projects that could only be possible in a virtual setting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Music Department considers him a great resource because of his knowledge and assistance in making remote recordings for online performance presentations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Mhr1T5Bt-OE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior recital project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he created a video collage of himself playing across campus using his phone and &#8220;a cheap tripod.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a lot of fun," Hidy said. "I wanted to include the campus not only because it&#8217;s pretty but to bring people closer to the campus because everyone has been away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidy said the campus&#8217;s beauty is what drew him to UC Santa Cruz. He grew up in Sebastopol where his dad is a bamboo fly rod maker and his mom a nurse. He was inspired to play the horn by his brother, a trumpet player.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took up the French horn in sixth grade &#8220;because it looked cool.&#8221; He really wanted to play the alto sax, too, but the school didn&#8217;t have one. The teacher said he could play trombone, so he did.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What really propelled him to music was a summer jazz camp where he learned to improvise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played in the county symphony and all the bands his high school offered. Looking toward college he chose UCSC even though it&#8217;s not known as a music conservatory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think a smaller department allows individual students to have a more focused experience,&#8221; Hidy said. &#8220;I enjoyed the small scale.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidy will graduate after just three years at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bittersweet for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just about half of my education has been online.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of bittersweet, Hidy is also a recipe developer at a Santa Cruz chocolate maker.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Food and music hit the same synapses in anyone&#8217;s brain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you taste food there&#8217;s a level of harmony of flavors. Food and harmony are pretty much the same thing.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d83b406080727017480ce7268c561364"><name>garcia-norberto-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Norberto Garcia </title><summary>As Norberto (Norbit) Garcia interviewed 18 families about their experiences for his senior thesis, he was reminded of why he chose sociology as a major—the realization that he wanted to help communities that are underrepresented and motivate students like him to go to college.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I found myself taking a sociology class at Cabrillo College after failing my first year at UC Santa Cruz," he said. "I quickly discovered my passion for sociology and realized I wanted to help communities that are underrepresented and motivate students like me to go to college."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia is the son of undocumented immigrants from Tepic, Nayarit, in Mexico. His family crossed the border when he was 4 years old, and he still remembers what it was like to get to the other side. The family was forced to kill his pet pig so they could have food during their journey to the U.S.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia nearly dropped out of high school, until he had an unexpected turnaround. He told his parents he identified as bisexual and wanted to join the cheer team. His parents accepted his decision to "come out" but also insisted he get a job, which he did, at a fast-food restaurant. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now he's proud to say he's the first in his family to finish high school, attend college, and graduate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Having all that going on forced me to learn time management, and it all just fell into place," he said. "Then I was lucky to have a school counselor, who motivated me to apply for college."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia got into UCSC and moved here, describing Santa Cruz as an adventure, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both in terms of&#160; academic and nonacademic activities. He continued to work in the food industry and did some tutoring. He said he found his role model in Rebecca London, UCSC associate professor of sociology, and was accepted into the American Sociological Association Honors Program, where he'll present his senior thesis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia will take part in this month's </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/commencement-planning.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Crossing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, accompanied by just his mom and sister.&#160;Sadly, his father was recently deported to Mexico, due to extenuating circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His next dream is to move to Los Angeles and prepare for law school.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">"I plan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work and study for the LSAT, so I can eventually get into a top school and become a lawyer," he said. "I have a lot to do, but I'm not in a hurry.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray Jara didn&#8217;t have college in mind until his freshman year at Patriot High School in Jurupa Valley, near Riverside.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never really knew what college was,&#8221; he said. But he liked science and was good at it. A junior-year trip to Northern California with AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination), a college-readiness organization, brought him to UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz caught my eye, it&#8217;s an amazing college in the middle of the forest, by the beach,&#8221; he remembers. Another factor was UCSC&#8217;s reputation in astrophysics and physics, he said, an interest of his.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jara, 21, is the first in his family to attend a four-year college. He is the only son of parents who were born in Mexico. One half-sister is older, and he has two younger sisters. His mother is a stay-at-home mom, now; his dad works in construction.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before he arrived as a first-year student, Jara changed his mind to electrical engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been placed in advanced physics courses in his junior and senior years where he worked on circuits and electronic devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He admits to some doubts that first year, feeling engineering wasn&#8217;t what he wanted to do. But a friend he met playing basketball &#8220;kept on motivating me to stay, and I&#8217;m happy I stayed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His concentration now is on photonics and electronic devices, working in Professor Ali A. Yanik&#8217;s lab to create a biosensor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID shutdown has affected Jara&#8217;s plans. He initially hoped to complete the five-year undergrad-plus-masters program, but the online workload made it difficult and some required classes were cancelled. His plan now is to continue at UCSC to get his masters in electrical engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That friend who encouraged him to stay in engineering also persuaded him to apply for a research symposium through the UCSC STEM Diversity Programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought it was a scholarship,&#8221; Jara said. &#8220;I had no idea my major could have research.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) program provides funding for a research lab placement but leaves it up to the student to find and be accepted in a lab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was lucky enough to get accepted by Ali,&#8221; Jara said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8c011b080727017480ce7260c2983fe"><name>valle-rodriguez-sharon-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sharon Valle Rodriguez</title><summary>When she started at UCSC, Sharon Valle Rodriguez was unsure about everything.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relocating to New York for her senior year at UC Santa Cruz because of the pandemic wasn't exactly an unprecedented move for Sharon Valle Rodriguez. Born in Spain, she's moved at least once every three years, from Mexico to Texas, Arizona, Indiana, and California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was here that she truly found herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When I started at UCSC, I was just an 18-year-old girl who was unsure about everything," she said. "I learned to be independent and to take care of myself, mentally and physically. I learned about emotional intelligence. Now I believe in myself and know I can achieve my goals. I know where I want to go and how to navigate the spaces I am in."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the&#160;things she already misses from her time on campus are the trees, the beautiful skies, and adventures like the one she had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with her roommate to the Garden of Eden, aka the Big Rock Hole on the San Lorenzo River. It was a steep, sandy path down to the swimming hole, and they got disoriented on their way back, finding themselves lost in the forest in the dark of night.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Together we eventually found our way back, and it's a memory I now cherish," Rodriguez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an </span><a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/Who_We_Are/EOPAbout.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational Opportunity Programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EOP) student, she benefitted from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> various academic and personal support resources for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first-generation college students from low-income and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. She's gotten work experience, too, as an administrative receptionist for EOP. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pursuing majors in both Latin American and Latino studies, and in legal studies, seemed to come naturally for Rodriguez. During her very first class, she discovered a passion for the subject matter. She realized that immigrants are often criminalized in our society, which has led to her plan to pursue "crimmigration," the convergence of criminal law and immigration law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, when she accepts her diploma, she'll be the first in her family to graduate from college, and she'll do it in three years, with high honors in both of her majors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She plans to work for two years as a paralegal or legal clerk to gain experience in the legal field. She'll also study for the LSAT and start her application for law school, with the hope of becoming a public defender.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8ccddd680727017480ce726a5b50cac"><name>xirenayi-simayijiang-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Simayijiang Xirenayi   </title><summary>When Simayijiang "Sherin" Xirenayi left home at age 19, she knew she wanted to study biology.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simayijiang</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sherin" Xirenayi grew up in Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China, where her family is part of the Uyghur ethnic minority and Turkic Muslims.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Xirenayi left home at age 19, she knew she wanted to study biology, but first, she needed to improve her English skills. She attended De Anza College, a community college in Cupertino, before she transferred to UC Santa Cruz in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;It wasn't an easy move.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I didn't have many friends, and the classes were large and tough for me," she said. "I failed three classes and ended up on academic probation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her life turned a corner when she was asked to meet with a campus adviser.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"She guided me, and I was able to change my study strategy and my attitude toward life,'' Xirenayi said. "I started to work out and to be more outgoing, and little by little, I was able to improve myself and my situation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's also when she became fascinated with genetics, evolution, and natural selection, which was very different from her beliefs as a child in Xinjiang. She tried analyzing genomes and found her passion in programming and bioinformatics&#8212;the science of collecting and analyzing complex biological data, such as genetic codes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xirenayi was supposed to graduate a year ago, but she stayed to get her minor in bioinformatics, and she describes her last year as her most productive one yet. She has lived the last year in Milpitas, and plans to work as a research associate before she pursues post-graduate education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I feel like I just woke up," she says. "I've changed so much, but I want to keep developing a stronger perspective and work for a year or two. I really like who I am today."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just as she expressed her gratitude to her adviser for her early academic success, Xirenayi recognizes professors who have guided her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"During the last year, when I was lost about what to do after graduation and how to apply for jobs," she said, "I met professors Guido Bordignon and David Bernick. They helped me with career advice, job seeking, and interview practices, and with their support and my effort, I found the job I wanted."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8d3d44080727017480ce726813480e8"><name>dornadula-vaishnavi-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vaishnavi Dornadula </title><summary>Vaishnavi Dornadula was a leader in creating the first-ever Baskin Day celebration, which launched in February 2020.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before she started designing robots and high-tech "smart jackets" at UC Santa Cruz, Vaishnavi Dornadula loved crafting jewelry and shaping models out of clay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Growing up in Fremont, I was actually really interested in the arts and anything where I could work with my hands and build,&#8221; Dornadula said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first she wasn&#8217;t sure if all this crafting was a private hobby or the pathway to a future career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when she received her acceptance notification from UC Santa Cruz, she, her mother, and a friend decided to explore the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. The trio wound up at Jack&#8217;s Lounge, a popular gathering place at Baskin, where the Hack-a-Bot robot engineering competition was taking place. The fast-paced contests and the high-spirited, friendly, and competitive atmosphere enthralled her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience cemented her decision to become a Slug, and inspired her to study robotics at Baskin. That memory later motivated Dornadula to attempt something she&#8217;d never tried before: build a complex, high-profile Baskin Engineering celebration from scratch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dornadula had been looking for ways that she and her engineering cohorts could highlight the achievements of Baskin faculty and students in an inviting, hands-on format that would appeal to the widest possible audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of her brainstorming was the first-ever Baskin Day celebration, which launched in February 2020. Since then, it has turned into a popular campus tradition, with students from across the disciplines, as well as off-campus visitors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The celebration includes a career fair, a women in tech panel, a talent show, "shark tank" pitch session, professional Q &amp; A panel, and keynote presentation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dornadula knew that bringing all of these components together would be a serious undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But this celebration is really important to me because I truly believe it fills a space that needs to be filled,&#8221; Dornadula said. &#8220;Baskin Day was meant to build a bridge between members of the Baskin School of Engineering, the community of UCSC, Santa Cruz community members, and the alumni. It was also to help students through workshops and networking opportunities throughout the event.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her time at Baskin, Dornadula has immersed herself in the field of &#8220;soft robotics,&#8221; which involves building robots out of yielding, pliant, flexible materials that are programmed to move like organic lifeforms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has also taken part in class labs and built a robot that does tasks such as beacon detection with sensors. This year, she is completing a team capstone project in which she and her cohorts hope to build a &#8220;fall injury mitigation smart jacket&#8221; that could lessen the injuries for older adults who stumble and lose their footing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of creating Baskin Day helped Dornadula grow as a leader, teammate, and person. Before she jumped into this big project, &#8220;I would absolutely consider myself to be an introvert, but Baskin Day forced me out of that shell," she said. "It motivated me to focus on my goal and set aside my nervousness to get the job done.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8dcdfb680727017480ce726ee42da00"><name>sanchez-godinez-david-commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>David Sanchez Godinez</title><summary>David Sanchez Godinez arrived at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for scientific exploration.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When David Sanchez Godinez was a boy, he used to ask his parents question after question about the way things worked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to understand the inner workings of the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was annoying for my parents to deal with, but they did a great job of encouraging me to explore whatever caught my interest,&#8221; Sanchez said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, he had no idea that the world was full of unsolved mysteries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I always assumed that most things had already been discovered,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on a research report in his biology class at Granada High School, Sanchez discovered that the textbook answers were in short supply. It was up to him to make his way forward.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I realized that research was relevant, and there are still big problems to solve," Sanchez said. &#8220;For some reason, that made a lightbulb flash in my brain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez arrived at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for scientific exploration, but adjusting to college life was a challenge. A first-generation college student, he could not turn to his parents for advice about coping and thriving at a university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was on me to apply myself and make use of my college education,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think being thrown into independence is difficult, and I&#8217;m definitely lucky to have been surrounded by hard-working and caring people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a full load of science classes and getting hands-on learning honed his scientific knowledge&#8212;especially his experience working as an undergraduate researcher in the Doug Kellogg Lab, where he studied the ways budding yeast translate their growth into signals that drive cell cycle progression.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Courses teach you about important fundamentals in the field, but applying that knowledge to a scientific question is a whole other learning experience,&#8221; Sanchez said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez was a fellow in the UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) Program, which trains high-achieving students to help prepare them for entry into graduate programs leading to a Ph.D. in the biomedical sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funded through the National Institutes of Health, the MARC Program's goals are to increase the numbers and success rates of underrepresented scientists and to prepare students for biomedical research careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also made time to do peer outreach as vice president of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) chapter, helping students thrive during a time of social distancing and online classes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Volunteering and giving back to my community are important because those principles helped me get to where I am today," he said. &#8220;I had teachers who went above and beyond for me, and that passion helped shape who I am. My mentor in the lab does not get paid to train and mentor me, but his patience and encouragement have shaped who I am as a scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is why I try my best to give back to my community,&#8221; Sanchez said. "With SACNAS, we show students from all walks of life that STEM is for everyone. It isn&#8217;t a field exclusive to men or rich people, and anyone can enjoy what nature has to offer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez thought about taking a break and relaxing a bit before heading off to graduate school. Instead, he is going directly into the UC San Francisco&#8217;s Tetrad Ph.D. program, which provides rigorous and innovative training in science and biotechnology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Actually, I&#8217;m going to do a summer rotation in the lab there, as well!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to training to become a better scientist.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e778d98280727017480ce7263e91dbac"><name>moray-feeding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Snowflake morays can feed on land, swallow prey without water</title><summary>While most fish need water to feed, the unique anatomy of moray eels gives snowflake morays the ability to grab and swallow prey on land.</summary><start-date>1623049200000</start-date><path>/2021/06/moray-feeding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/moray-feeding</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1623086127450</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623278186881</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tsLQ52GyiUc" title="YouTube video player" width="400"></iframe></embed><width>400</width><caption><p>Snowflake morays can grab and swallow prey on land without water thanks to an extra set of jaws in their throats.</p></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/moray-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/moray-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moray-400.jpg</name><display-name>moray-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>95620</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>A snowflake moray eel in the ocean emerging from rocks</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/moray-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/moray-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moray-80.jpg</name><display-name>moray-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>19822</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A snowflake moray eel underwater inside a research tank</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The snowflake moray occurs throughout the Indo-Pacific area, from East Africa to the eastern Pacific.

A new study, however, shows that snowflake morays can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsLQ52GyiUc">grab and swallow prey on land</a> without water thanks to an extra set of jaws in their throats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moray eel captures prey with its first set of jaws, a second set of &#8220;pharyngeal jaws&#8221; then reaches out to grasp the struggling prey and pull it down into the moray&#8217;s throat. Rita Mehta, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, first described this astonishing feeding mechanism in a 2007 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paper.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.234047">new study</a>, published </span>June 7<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Experimental Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shows that these pharyngeal jaws enable at least one species of moray to feed on land.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most fishes really need water to feed,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;This is the first example of a fish that can feed on land without relying on water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports of snowflake morays coming out of the water to grab crabs on the shore prompted her to take a closer look, she said. &#8220;These particular moray eels tend to eat hard-shelled prey like crabs, and I would see reports in the literature of them moving out of the water and lunging for crabs, but it was unclear what happened next.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even fish well adapted to an amphibious lifestyle, such as mudskippers, need water to swallow their food. &#8220;Mudskippers come up onto mudflats and grab prey like small crabs and insects. They get around the challenge of swallowing on land by sucking up water and then using the water they have reserved in their mouth to swallow,&#8221; Mehta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowflake morays can do it without water because of their unusual feeding mechanics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have highly moveable pharyngeal jaws in their throat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Once the moray captures prey in its oral jaws, the pharyngeal jaws grab onto the prey again and move it further back into the esophagus. This mechanical movement does not rely on water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrating that snowflake morays can eat on land, however, was no easy task. It took Mehta and a team of undergraduates over five years to train seven snowflake morays to slither up a ramp onto a platform, grab a piece of fish, and swallow it before returning to the water.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They feel safer in the water, so at first they would just grab the fish and go straight back into the water with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I relied on a team of dedicated and enthusiastic undergraduate researchers to work on training them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coauthor Kyle Donohoe was especially helpful, she said, because of his animal training experience from working with marine mammals as a research assistant at the Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory next to Mehta&#8217;s lab at UCSC&#8217;s Long Marine Laboratory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the eels were trained to feed on the platform, Mehta documented this unusual feeding behavior on video. She said the feeding performance of young snowflake morays is as good on land as it is in water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a result, these particular morays can utilize very different environments for food resources,&#8221; she said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e889d6c380727017480ce726c636c5c6"><name>teaching-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recipients of 2021 Excellence in Teaching Awards announced</title><summary>The Committee on Teaching (COT) is delighted to announce the 10 recipients of this prestigious campus-wide award from all five divisions. </summary><start-date>1623049200000</start-date><display-name>Teaching awards</display-name><path>/2021/06/teaching-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/teaching-awards</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1623104018080</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623177244722</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz celebrates its innovative and dedicated teachers with the <a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/cot-excellence-in-teaching/index.html">2021 Excellence in Teaching Awards.</a>&#160;Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the luncheon with Chancellor Cynthia Larive had to be postponed.</p>
<p>The Committee on Teaching (COT) is delighted to announce the 10 recipients of this prestigious campus-wide award from all five divisions.

</ul>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Beaumont, Associate Professor, Politics</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Beaumont is incomparably kind and thoughtful with students. She also created a canvas site that was easy to navigate and understand, because she caught on/learned the online classroom but very well. Incredibly accommodating and always available for students. I really enjoyed the class even though it was challenging at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz, as her graduate students call her, teaches classes, writes brilliant syllabi, conducts discussion, advises, researches and mentors, but perhaps the most consequential impact that Liz has on her students does not stem from the individual success of each of her job descriptions, but rather from the intentions of her actions and the ways in which she creates a welcoming, non-competitive and exploratory classroom (even virtually!) Between the fall election and ongoing racial injustice, the pandemic, and virtual classes, fall 2020 was a tough quarter. Liz brought so much energy, intention, and positivity to our 3-hour Zoom seminars. The clunkiness of online discussions didn&#8217;t seem to phase Liz; she effortlessly helped us connect our thoughts, explore them more deeply, and gave us a space to intellectually process the current events of fall 2020. Not only this, but Liz gave each and every one of us generous constructive feedback on our weekly reading responses and final papers. Through this feedback, I improved my written communication of ideas, and was able to explore more deeply how exactly the course&#8217;s content could provide my developing thesis project with a theoretical framework.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>David Bernick, Assistant Adjunct Professor, Biomolecular Engineering</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. David Bernick possesses qualities that many other science professors have trouble showing. He cares and becomes very invested in his students both academically and on a personal level. Bernick has touched the lives of many and changed them for the better. Dr.B has even virtually met my little sister and presented at her high school research club where he very much enjoyed answering the questions of very eager and curious teenagers. Engineering needs more humans like him because he cares so so so much and is very generous. He is also an excellent lecturer, almost cryptic, which makes class interesting and humorous. He has great wit and his personality makes the student feel safe to make mistakes and ask questions. Dr.B has a 10/10 in excellence. best UCSC faculty. deserves all the awards. We all love him very very very much. He is the absolute best. He deserves this award and many more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Bernick is an amazing professor that makes everybody feel welcome but also challenges us to excel as students, people, and engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nandini Bhattacharya, Mathematics, Continuing Lecturer: Ron Ruby Award Recipient</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I am an international student, and due to my limited math background I was very nervous taking math classes again as part of my continuing education. My past professors were not very good, and math was my greatest fear about studying in the USA. COVID added to my stress, as there was no direct class interaction. When Prof. Nandini started teaching my first class I realized she was an excellent teacher and really cared about the students. And much to my surprise I rapidly became comfortable with math, and indeed have come to love math. She was always available during office hours when I had questions, whether from myself or other students. Her dedication to teaching is obvious. To my great surprise math is now my favorite subject! I used to fear math and now I love it! That was the last thing I expected, and I owe this to Prof. Nandini. If there is someone who should be awarded an Excellent Teaching Award, that should be Nandini. She fully deserves it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nandini is really sweet and cares a lot about students. She made sure the course materials were affordable and listened to our feedback. She wants to help us succeed. Her lectures are very fast-paced but she posts recordings so you can rewatch them at your own pace.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Audun Dahl, Associate Professor, Psychology</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Dahl was extremely supportive of his students. He made sure that the topics were relevant to the examples of the students and continued the conversation by making sure we either had breakout rooms with new people or with the same people. While COVID and marches were going on, we also faced the CZU fires and he was more than accommodating for the students. Seeing him also become extremely affected because of the fires and then powering through afterwards provided a chance for us to be motivated to continue with our class while placing our safety as our top priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Dahl is an incredibly supportive and enthusiastic instructor who cares greatly about the understanding and learning of his students. He has an incredible ability to make seemingly daunting subjects, such as learning a coding language, very accessible and easy to understand. He focuses on guiding the student in building a skill rather than memorizing formulas, placing importance on the student&#8217;s development into a self-sufficient and confident coder. His class is structured to incorporate plenty of activities and examples to help students apply their knowledge to new problems. His passion for his students&#8217; interest in the topic and success with their projects also extends beyond the class. He has stressed a continued availability if we ever get stuck and mentioned that he would love to have us reach out so that he can continue to mentor us throughout our coding journeys! I would take another class with Dr. Dahl in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Alegra Eroy-Reveles, Assistant Teaching Professor, Chemistry and Biochemistry</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Eroy-Reveles truly cares about each and every student, and gives us many tools for success. She is always available outside of class time to help students individually or in small groups. Additionally, she is very clear about the schedule and requirements of her class, making the course very accessible. She implemented the &#8220;flipped classroom&#8221; model, so we watched the lectures ahead of time and worked on problem-solving during synchronous class time. This mode of learning greatly increased engagement during class time and aided in learning problem-solving strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She made us all feel like we had the power and ability to easily learn anything and it gave me the best confidence to always try my best in her class. I am a DRC student and she presented herself with all the support she could offer me to succeed. I earned an A in her class and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever felt so good about receiving an A in my life before. She knows the process of learning.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hance, Assistant Professor, Physics</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Hance explains concepts very clearly and checks in regularly with the class that we&#8217;re keeping up with material. His notes are short, succinct and clear, and he explains difficult concepts well with metaphors and referring to introductory level concepts. He often checks in with us at the beginning of class on our mental state and genuinely cares about our well being. Midway through PHYS 110A he experimented with asynchronous lectures to see if it would work better for us, and while it wasn&#8217;t a hit with the class I appreciate that he was willing to try different teaching styles for us. At the end of the course, the entire class organized a group &#8220;We love you, Hance&#8221; chant to him to show him our appreciation for how understanding, accommodating, and helpful he was. He is deserving of this award as he did excel during an unprecedented time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hance performed exceptionally well in the transfer to remote learning. His lectures were instructive and engaging, and he maintained himself an open and available professor, both in teaching the subject and in his presence as a caring, passionate instructor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>David Ingleman, Anthropology, Graduate Student Instructor</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;David is perhaps the most experienced and passionate teacher in the anthropology department. Despite being a graduate student, he has put more thought and care into his course and supporting his students in and outside of the classroom than any professor I&#8217;ve had. He truly wants you to not only succeed in his course for a letter grade but understand the concepts and understand anthropology&#8217;s importance to the world. Despite being online for both spring and summer quarters, he made a fun and interactive course that really helped understand the material such as: virtual tours of museums, online archaeological activities to simulate excavating a site, and many more. His passion for this subject is demonstrated in his detail heavy lectures and personal experiences with the concepts. I have always been a lazy student, although I got better each year, David had noticed my essay draft wasn&#8217;t up to par, and asked if I would like support during office hours. I took up his offer and ended up producing perhaps the best paper I&#8217;ve ever written. Because of this it made me more confident to not only ask for help but analyze, critically think, and write better. This has given me life skills to use outside of academics. I had learned I was capable of succeeding and working hard, as long as I learned to discipline myself and develop better study habits. In summary, David has given me great intellectual growth which I have already begun using. Whether his effect on his students be small or large, I truly believe they all take away something important from his class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His teaching method was something that I have never seen before. To put it into words, it was perfect. He dedicates most of his time to his students. That shows how much he cares about his student&#8217;s education.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Philip Longo, Continuing Lecturer, Writing Program</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Longo provided students incredibly constructive feedback to all assignments, and brought in many guest speakers from the McHenry Library and other areas to guide us on research and producing different types of writing. His passion for rhetoric really inspired and motivated us all, to the point where we made memes about rhetoric and Professor Longo outside of class, with classmates on weekends. We also ended up compiling these memes into a digital quarterbook (yearbook) that we gifted to Professor Longo. This class and Professor Longo&#8217;s instruction was consistent and provided such a collaborative, welcoming environment, something we all needed as first-years learning remotely. I feel like I&#8217;ve learned so much about the process of publishing academic work, how to refine and meta-cognitively reflect on my writing, understanding the expansiveness of rhetorical ecologies, and understanding how literacy sponsors have molded my writing and education. Professor Longo really helped me learn about research, rhetoric, and writing, and I made many friends in that class that I still talk to almost daily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Longo brought really positive energy, solid teaching, and a welcoming atmosphere as we approached new styles of writing and writing projects. He made himself available to talk to us and ensured that we had ample access to resources so that we knew not only what was accessible to us but also how to find external sources. Professor Longo not only spent time teaching us but also time with us, taking time to be serious when needed and light hearted to balance it out. I feel that my confidence has grown exponentially since taking his course, and now feel that writing and research is a lot easier than before. He treated writing with the weight it deserves, but he also recognized that this was a time for us to grow. He didn&#8217;t make us feel like we needed to get it perfect instantly, through drafts and revisions he showed us that nothing is ever perfect and instead the only thing we can do is improve.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ana Maria Seara, Lecturer, Languages and Applied Linguistics</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Seara is an amazing professor. It is very difficult to learn a foreign language even in the best of circumstances but with the move to a fully online class, it&#8217;s even harder. Professor Seara adapted seamlessly to the new online format. She is an engaging creative instructor who managed to create a community out of our class. I looked forward to every single class as an opportunity to see my classmates and learn more Portuguese through all of the varied exercises that she gave us. Her true passion for teaching and her native tongue are infectious and evident through all of the hard work that she put in to help us learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Seara is an amazing teacher. Learning another language is difficult and yet she makes it fun. She obviously spends a lot of time and effort on the class and it shows. She thinks of so many creative and engaging ways for us to practice what we learn that I always look forward to class. Even during this strange online world she manages to create a close knit community out of the class. Truly one of the best teachers I have ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Donald Williams, Lecturer, Theater Arts</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Williams is not only an inspiring teacher, but also an uplifting one. I probably would have dropped out of or transferred from UCSC if not for Mr. Williams facilitating Rainbow Theater. He is the only African-American faculty in the entire Theater Arts Department, and as a theater student, without him I would have been very discouraged to continue my studies. In every class, he works hard to meet students where they are at and treat his students as human beings first. His empathy surpasses most professors I&#8217;ve met here. It is also apparent he works tirelessly to provide us with opportunities within and outside of UCSC. He also keeps great contact with Rainbow Theater alumni and gives his current students every opportunity to connect with former students and learn about the entertainment industry in a real-world capacity. He is simply the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the work I&#8217;ve done with Mr Williams and his organization Cultural Arts and Diversity, I would&#8217;ve taken an academic leave. Mr Williams has been a driving force inspiring myself and many other students to push on during the turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congratulations to all of the 2020&#8211;21 Excellence in Teaching Award recipients! This has been an extraordinary year and the Committee on Teaching are proud and grateful for the teaching and learning that all of our instructors have provided for our UC Santa Cruz community!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e9867eb680727017480ce726b7f9a60e"><name>dickens-registration-brief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Registration open for the 40th annual Virtual Dickens Universe featuring ‘A Christmas Carol’</title><summary>The Dickens Universe is an annual gathering of scholars, teachers, and members of the general public who share a love of Dickens's writings and his era.

This summer, the Universe features<i> A Christmas Carol</i> and will take place online.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the best known and most widely beloved of Dickens&#8217;s works, <i>A Christmas Carol</i> is the story of one man&#8217;s conversion from miserly misanthropy to a belief in the goodness of humankind and an acceptance of his place in the larger human community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>A unique feature of the remote event is the opportunity for students worldwide to earn five credits in one week by enrolling in the UC Santa Cruz Summer Session course <em>Charles Dickens</em> (LIT 112C). Offered in conjunction with the annual conference, this intensive, one-week online course will focus on </span><span><i>A Christmas Carol</i>, its many adaptations and re-interpretations, and its continuing relevance today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The class includes lectures by distinguished scholars, panel discussions, film screenings, and a small undergraduate seminar and writing workshop. Summer Session tuition and fees apply. Contact <a href="mailto:summer@ucsc.edu">summer@ucsc.edu</a> if you need support enrolling in the course.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/2021-schedule.html">schedule for the week is online</a> </span><span>and includes an appearance by Miriam Margolyes, who played Professor Sprout in the <i>Harry Potter</i> films. An avid Dickens fan, Margolyes has attended the Universe in the past and will be delivering a reading on the final day of the conference.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Whether through the Universe or the course, UCSC offers the opportunity to immerse yourself in the world of Charles Dickens this summer.</span><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that Professor of Linguistics Adrian Brasoveanu has agreed to serve as Associate Campus Provost.</p>
<p>In this half-time role, Adrian will work with campus leadership on critical projects including institutional research and assessment, interdisciplinary research initiatives, space and resource management, strategic enrollment planning, and other campus initiatives.</p>
<p>Our campus will greatly benefit from Adrian&#8217;s analytical expertise, and his understanding of campus issues and challenges. He has been active in service to our campus, serving on our Committee on Planning and Budget, chairing the Humanities Division Committee on Academic Personnel, and chairing the Senate Committee on Career Advising. He also served as a Faculty Administrative Leadership Program fellow, working on the design, consultation process, and launch of our Pathway to Retirement program.</p>
<p>Adrian earned his M.A. and B.A. degrees from the University of Bucharest, and his Ph.D. from Rutgers University. Before joining UC Santa Cruz in 2008, Adrian was a postdoctoral fellow in the Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in the Humanities program at Stanford University. As a formal semanticist and a computational psycholinguist, he looks at linguistic meaning and how the human mind grasps it.</p>

<p>Constance Rockosi, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will serve as interim director of UCO, effective July 1, 2021. She currently serves as the UCO associate director for technical facilities. A national search for a new permanent director is under way, led by the UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>UCO is a multi-campus research unit with headquarters at UC Santa Cruz. It operates Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton and the technical labs at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, and is managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. UCO is also the center for UC participation in the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) project.</p>
<p>Max said she has enjoyed leading UCO for the past seven years. &#8220;It&#8217;s been tremendous fun to see all the good things UCO is doing and to try to make it stronger,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve enjoyed working with the UCO team and reaching out to the other campuses to get them more involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max was appointed interim director in 2014 at a time of great uncertainty about continued funding for Lick Observatory, but the financial situation has since improved. &#8220;Our whole situation was very precarious back then, and it&#8217;s really turned around now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The UC Office of the President has been very positive about its support for UCO in general and for Lick Observatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>A $1 million gift in 2020 established the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/lick-campbell-fund.html">William Wallace Campbell Director&#8217;s Fund for Lick Observatory</a>, creating an endowment to support the director&#8217;s priorities for the observatory.</p>
<p>The past year also brought new challenges, as the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic limited access to the facilities and an August wildfire threatened Lick Observatory. Firefighters were able to protect the main buildings and all of the telescopes from serious damage, and astronomers were soon able to resume telescope operations. The fire burned two storage buildings and damaged infrastructure, however, and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/wildfire-relief-fund.html">recovery efforts</a> are ongoing.</p>
<p>Keck Observatory&#8217;s twin 10-meter telescopes, equipped with state-of-the-art observing instruments and adaptive optics, continue to be the world&#8217;s most scientifically productive optical and infrared telescopes. &#8220;In my mind, Keck is the jewel in our crown,&#8221; Max said. &#8220;It has really made UC as good as it is in astronomy. Having access to these wonderful facilities at Lick and Keck has allowed UC to attract top faculty members in astronomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max is a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and has revolutionized the capabilities of ground-based telescopes. She served as director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC prior to her appointment as director of UCO, and said she hopes to resume her engagement in adaptive optics research after her retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to get more involved in the work on new adaptive optics systems, but I&#8217;m also looking forward to spending time doing new things,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Max has received many awards and honors for her accomplishments in astronomy and physics. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the California Academy of Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

For about the past six years, Serrano has been working with young Black and Latino men in South Central Los Angeles to understand how gender ideologies are formed in relation to carceral violence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On the one hand, I think about how carcerality shapes the lives of Black and Latino young men, but I also look at how the youth themselves resist and organize against the carceral state,&#8221; Serrano said. &#8220;And within all that, I&#8217;m thinking about questions around gender and masculinity and emotions and well-being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through observations, interviews, focus groups, and other research, Serrano has compiled a digital archive of over 150 documents that show how youth are navigating the intersection of race, gender, and policing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started noticing themes around how harmful experiences with policing, criminalization, or incarceration can shape young men&#8217;s ideas about manhood, particularly their relationship to their emotions. But he also saw that organized resistance offered &#8220;these really beautiful, powerful moments,&#8221; where young men could be vulnerable and share their emotions and experiences with one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These observations helped Serrano hone in on gender as a key interest area to explore further.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The sociology of masculinity is often informed by the experiences of white men,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That leaves no room to think about the complexity of Black and Latino young men; both their emotional lives and these moments of vulnerability and healing, and also just the complicated nature of the inner-city context.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrano&#8217;s dissertation research will aim to bring more depth to understandings of gender and to describe the broad range of impacts that policing can have.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m exploring this idea of &#8216;carceral seepage&#8217; as a metaphor because I think water damage is a helpful analytical lens to think about how carceral logics seep into our everyday lives and the types of damage that comes from that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s like a slow leak that happens little by little. Other times it&#8217;s like a storm or a flood: a sudden, very traumatic experience. But there are often invisible, internal consequences that are more long-term.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrano plans to explore this metaphor over the coming year. He&#8217;s grateful that the Ford Foundation funding will allow him more time to focus on this research. He also plans to talk through his ideas with the young people who inspired them. Serrano says he&#8217;s looking forward to having that much-needed time for reflection.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the topics that I&#8217;m writing about, I honestly believe that it requires time to think through these ideas and not rush to produce, but instead, to really sit with the experiences of the folks who give life to this work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s definitely what this year means to me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2c566ba80727017480ce7261e8fcce5"><name>calabasas-garden</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Research partnership will highlight STEM learning in local community garden</title><summary>A grant from the Spencer Foundation will help UC Santa Cruz researchers document the many types of STEM learning taking place in a Latinx immigrant-led community garden in Watsonville. </summary><start-date>1623222000000</start-date><path>/2021/06/calabasas-garden</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/calabasas-garden</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1623275693714</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623277895608</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/calabasas-4001.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/calabasas-4001.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>calabasas-4001.jpg</name><display-name>calabasas-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>106609</file-size><width>400</width><height>286</height></image><image-alt>children in a garden surrounded by rows of corn and flowers</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/calabasas-g2-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/calabasas-g2-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>calabasas-g2-80.jpg</name><display-name>calabasas-g2-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25628</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>children in a garden surrounded by rows of corn and flowers</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Calabasas Community Garden is <span style="font-weight: 400;">a resource for education, health, and belonging for local families in the Watsonville area.&#160;Photo courtesy of the (H)ACER program.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $50,000 grant from the Spencer Foundation will help UC Santa Cruz education researchers document the many types of STEM learning taking place in a Latinx immigrant-led community garden at Calabasas Elementary School in Watsonville.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These efforts strengthen a longstanding partnership between the university and the community to support the garden as a resource for education, health, and belonging. Many of the families who use the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/calabasascommunitygarden/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calabasas Community Garden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have at least one parent who is a farmworker. The garden provides a source of healthy food and a space to gather for afterschool activities, but it&#8217;s also a place for families to share knowledge and work together to solve problems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardeners collaborate to determine the best positioning and arrangement of crops to maximize use of space and meet the needs of every plant. They also experiment with adapting traditional cultivation strategies and plant varieties from their ancestral homelands to fit the unique growing conditions of Pajaro Valley. Researchers say these are all effective forms of intergenerational learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spencer Foundation funding will support a study of this learning that will bring increased recognition to this aspect of what gardeners are accomplishing together.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People are engaging in scientific inquiry and engineering problem solving in this community garden,&#8221; said Linnea Beckett, a principal investigator on the new grant. &#8220;There's a lot of STEM happening in the garden, and everyone from 80-year-old great grandfathers to the littlest kids in a family are participating in it. But the type of learning we see in the garden is different from what you see in a typical traditional classroom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beckett is the director of UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://collegeten.ucsc.edu/hacer/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(H)ACER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program&#8212;which recruits undergraduate students from College Nine and College Ten as researchers and after-school program interns in the community garden&#8212;and over the years, she&#8217;s been informally observing the educational models that are at work in the space. One important element is that learning in the garden doesn&#8217;t rely on traditional hierarchical roles that designate one person as the teacher or expert and another as the student. Instead, everyone contributes their own unique insights, and learning happens together as a group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applied STEM learning happening in the garden also challenges educators to reimagine how STEM is defined and what its practice can look like.&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It goes back to this notion of questioning who gets to do STEM,&#8221; said Samuel Severance, an assistant professor of education and a co-principal investigator on the grant alongside Beckett. &#8220;A lot of communities have historically not been included in the STEM conversation. But when their expertise is valued, folks have a better opportunity to see themselves as practitioners of STEM and to put themselves on trajectories to continue to use STEM to contribute to their communities and to do things that are meaningful in their lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many of the families who participate in the community garden, one of the most meaningful applications of STEM is supporting the health and well-being of young people in the community. Yolonda Perez, whose daughters both previously attended Calabasas Elementary School, has organized community involvement in the garden for years. She says many families share stories about how the garden has made a positive impact in their children&#8217;s lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Children are physically and mentally healthier because the garden is getting them outside and getting them interested in things like plants and flowers and butterflies and insects,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;We can teach the kids that there&#8217;s another world outside of television and computer games.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez said one of her favorite things to see in the garden is how children develop relationships with food and the land. They begin to understand elements of agricultural science, like water conservation, plant growth, and soil chemistry. And in that process, they come to appreciate healthier foods.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many kids who never wanted to eat a vegetable before, but when they try something new in the garden, you see that spark in their eyes,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;They learn to love a new thing because they have been there with it through its journey of growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez says the interactions between UCSC students and the children at Calabasas Elementary School have also made a big impact over the years. She&#8217;d like to see more university students get involved. Undergraduates have been learning alongside community members in the garden for almost a decade, since Flora Lu, provost of College Nine and Ten and an environmental studies professor, originally launched the collaboration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Hernandez was once one of the undergraduates pitching in around the garden, and now she co-manages the space alongside Perez as the community outreach coordinator for (H)ACER. Hernandez and Perez, who both immigrated to the United States from Mexico, say that the garden offers a crucial sense of belonging and a pride of ownership for all those who apply their STEM knowledge to help it thrive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sense of pride may prove to be one of the most important lessons the garden has to offer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being in the garden, kids are seeing their parents teaching, and they see the richness and the value of these knowledges,&#8221; Herdandez said. &#8220;For kids to be proud and to see their parents with that pride in the work that they do means so much.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2eb135780727017480ce726ba37e516"><name>fall-in-person-instruction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First days of instruction, fall '21</title><summary>With the recent University of California announcement of the proposed vaccine mandate for students, staff, faculty and academic appointees, the widespread availability of vaccines, and steadily improving local conditions, we have made the decision to begin in-person instruction at the start of the fall quarter.</summary><start-date>1623222000000</start-date><display-name>First days of instruction, fall '21</display-name><path>/2021/06/fall-in-person-instruction</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/fall-in-person-instruction</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1623278162744</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1623278162744</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the recent <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/uc-encourages-covid-19-vaccinations-for-university-communities-while-reviewing-policy-requirements.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623363428757000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRuzht1bKKm1-zuAL6-JJipe5SQg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/uc-encourages-covid-19-vaccinations-for-university-communities-while-reviewing-policy-requirements.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University of California announcement</a> of the proposed vaccine mandate for students, staff, faculty and academic appointees, the widespread availability of vaccines, and steadily improving local conditions, we have made the decision to begin in-person instruction at the start of the fall quarter(for most programs, Sept. 23-24, 2021) rather than observing a brief period of remote instruction as <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/fall-quarter-planning.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623363428757000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7QYjK8AIdVtpoMh7PZ8yJqtPL0g" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/fall-quarter-planning.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced in March</a>.

Biehl, professor of anthropology at the University of Buffalo, State University of New York (SUNY), as vice provost and dean of the Graduate Division.</p>
<p>Biehl, who will start July 1, has held numerous leadership positions at the University at Buffalo in support of graduate education and international education.</p>
<p>He is currently working in the Office of the Provost at UB to enhance the national and international recognition of the university&#8217;s faculty, a project that is supported by a fellowship from the American Council on Education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our university will greatly benefit from Biehl&#8217;s perspective and expertise,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer in <a href="cpevc-grad-dean-announcement.xml">campus announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Strengthening the graduate experience at UC Santa Cruz continues to be a top priority for graduate students, faculty, and administrators, Kletzer said. The recent recommendations from the Joint Senate-Administration Working Group on Graduate Education, under review by Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Kletzer, provides the campus with a common framework for what is needed to support the success of students and strengthen the overall graduate enterprise.</p>
<p>Selecting a new dean and vice provost for Graduate Studies marks another step forward, Kletzer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Graduate students make essential contributions to our mission by creating new knowledge and ideas and contributing to the education of undergraduates,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I believe Biehl is well positioned to further advance our Graduate Division and strengthen our support for our graduate students in their academic journey and professional development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biehl previously served as associate dean for International Education and Enrollment in University at Buffalo&#8217;s College of Arts and Sciences, working closely with the dean to set strategic directions for the international graduate education programs and initiatives in the college&#8217;s 29 academic departments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thrilled to join the dynamic leadership team and exceptional faculty, staff, postdocs and graduate students at UC Santa Cruz and look forward to working collaboratively to provide world-class learning and research experiences and professional development training for graduate students,&#8221; Biehl said. "When I think about my life, I am always reminded of the life-changing effect my graduate years had on me. It was a time of enormous growth, during which I encountered innovative scholarship, met electrifying thinkers and developed personally. Now, I want to give back by fostering transformative graduate experiences and by creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere for graduate students across disciplines, and particularly for students from traditionally underrepresented groups. That includes making sure students are both heard and appreciated. I can&#8217;t think of a better place to foster a thriving graduate community than at an outstanding institution like UCSC and look forward to initiating these important conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biehl&#8217;s research interests include climate change in the past and present, material culture, museums and heritage. He is the author or co-editor of 10 books and more than 120 articles, book chapters and exhibitions. He serves as the director of the Institute for European and Mediterranean Archaeology, the Marian E. White Anthropology Research Museum, and the critical museum studies master&#8217;s program. A first generation college student, Biehl earned his Ph.D., M.A., and B.A. in archaeology from the University of the Saarland in Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany.</p>
<p>Biehl will succeed Quentin Williams, Professor of Earth and Planetary Science, who has led the Division of Graduate Studies since June 2019.</p>
<p>Biehl spent four years at UC Berkeley doing his postdoc and is excited to join the Santa Cruz community with his family, including his wife, Jody, a journalist, professor of English and native Californian, their teenaged children, Leo and Olivia, and two dogs, Zeus and Lola.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f72694f380727017480ce726ccd3c1d8"><name>cpevc-grad-dean-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Peter F.

<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Peter F. Biehl as vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies. Biehl will take up the post on July 1.</p>
<p>Biehl, a professor of anthropology, joins us from the University of Buffalo (UB), State University of New York (SUNY), where he has held numerous leadership positions in support of graduate education and international education.</p>
<p>Strengthening the graduate experience on our campus remains a top priority, one shared by the graduate students, faculty and administrators. The recent recommendations from the Joint Senate-Administration Working Group on Graduate Education, under review, provide us with a common framework for what is needed to support the success of our students and strengthen the overall graduate enterprise.</p>
<p>Selecting a new dean and vice provost for Graduate Studies is an important step forward. Our campus will greatly benefit from Biehl&#8217;s perspective and expertise. A robust, supportive, and thriving graduate enterprise is essential for UC Santa Cruz. Graduate students make critical contributions to our mission by creating new knowledge and ideas and contributing to the education of undergraduates. Graduate students will become the next generation of scholars and leaders. I believe Biehl is well positioned to further advance our Graduate Division and strengthen our support for our graduate students in their academic journeys and professional developments.</p>
<p>Biehl is currently working in the Office of the Provost at UB to enhance the national and international recognition of the university&#8217;s faculty, a project that is supported by a fellowship from the American Council on Education.</p>
<p>He also serves as the director of the Institute for European and Mediterranean Archaeology, the Marian E. White Anthropology Research Museum, and the critical museum studies master&#8217;s program.</p>
<p>Biehl previously served as associate dean for International Education and Enrollment in University of Buffalo&#8217;s College of Arts and Sciences, working closely with the dean to set strategic directions for the international education programs and initiatives in the college&#8217;s 29 academic departments, while also increasing the number of international graduate students who applied and enrolled in the college.</p>
<p>At the University at Buffalo, he chaired the Provost&#8217;s Task Force for Inclusion and Engagement of International Students, the Budget and Resources Committee of the General Education Program and the Campus-Wide Course Evaluations Committee. He is a recipient of the Distinguished Postdoc Mentor Award of the Graduate School and the SUNY Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Internationalization.</p>
<p>Biehl&#8217;s research interests include climate change in the past and present, material culture, museums and heritage. He is the author or co-editor of 10 books and more than 120 articles, book chapters and exhibitions.</p>
<p>A first-generation college student, Biehl earned his Ph.D., M.A., and B.A. in archaeology from the University of the Saarland in Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany.</p>
<p>Biehl will succeed Quentin Williams, Distinguished Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, who has led the Division of Graduate Studies as interim dean since June 2019. I am grateful to Quentin for his attentive stewardship of the Graduate Division and our graduate programs.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the search committee for its hard work, collaboration, and partnership. Participation in the public sessions was strong, and the feedback was helpful. Please join me in welcoming Peter Biehl to our campus community. I look forward to working with him.</p>

<p>As a longtime professor and now chancellor, I can say that the end of every year is a little bittersweet, with a mix of gratitude, relief, and optimism, as another class of students heads out into the world. This year is especially so. The 2020-21 academic year has been extraordinarily challenging. Together we have navigated unprecedented disruption. But I am also exceedingly proud of the resilience and strength our community has displayed, and the many achievements we have seen despite the significant obstacles. Congratulations to this year&#8217;s graduating class, and to all of our students. Your determination, perseverance and pursuit of excellence make us all proud to be Banana Slugs.</p>
<p>I am also filled with immense gratitude for the extraordinary spirit of this campus community. Every day I feel lucky to work alongside talented and passionate faculty and staff who obviously care deeply about this university, its students, and our mission. Thank you for all of your efforts this year. They are deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>As more and more people receive their COVID-19 vaccinations, and as our state, nation and world inch out of our pandemic-forced hibernation, this moment also feels like a time of new beginnings. We have shown ourselves to be exceedingly adaptable and creative, and I believe that this resourcefulness will serve as a strong foundation for UC Santa Cruz in the days and years to come.</p>
<p>I am optimistic about our future. Our voices &#8212; those of our students and faculty &#8212; are pushing societal and intellectual boundaries as we work to create a more just, equitable world. The promise of tomorrow is truly driving our best work. UCSC is proving to be where real change starts, and I could not be more proud. Fiat Slug!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy

philosophy) delivered the keynote address at the <strong><i>2021 Humanities Spring Awards</i></strong> ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span>The annual event celebrates the achievements of students, faculty, and alumni of the Humanities Division over the past 12 months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Held virtually this year, it included a new annual <i>Distinguished Undergraduate Alumni Award</i>&#8212;designed to recognize the transformative accomplishments of undergraduate humanities alumni who have led extraordinary lives and significantly impacted our world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to being honored, the awardee is also invited to give the keynote address at the annual awards ceremony, to share remarks about life beyond UCSC as a way to inspire future alumni in the Humanities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Dean Jasmine Alinder presented the inaugural award to Stewart, who won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for <i>The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke</i>, his definitive biography of the father of the Harlem Renaissance. He also received the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span>Now a professor of Black Studies at UC Santa Barbara, Stewart has spent his career studying the issues of race and culture as they relate to art, history, literature, music, and philosophy. His previous books include <em>1</em><i>001 Things Everyone Should Know About African American History</i> and <i>Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen</i>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A first-generation college</strong> <strong>graduate</strong>, Stewart received his undergraduate degree from UC Santa Cruz in philosophy, and his Ph.D. from Yale University in American Studies. He went on to become director of research at the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Anacostia Museum, a curator at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Portrait Gallery, and a senior advisor to the Reginald Lewis Museum of African American History and Culture in Baltimore, Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;After I left Santa Cruz and went to Yale, I always found that I was so well prepared, even though Santa Cruz was then relatively unknown to the East Coast establishment, so I really look back on my years as an undergraduate at Santa Cruz as the most important in my formation as a scholar,&#8221; Stewart noted in his talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The impact on me was huge," he added. "I had always had kind of an intellectual bent of mind, but it was at Santa Cruz that I really became a critical race thinker&#8212;someone who did sustained research in philosophy, psychology, and political theory.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Stewart spoke about the influence of the prominent UCSC professors he studied with, including Norman O. Brown, Herman Blake, and in particular, philosopher Maurice Natanson, who reached out and personally invited him to come to the campus. He also lauded the vibrant intellectual energy he found at the university.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I thought it was particularly profound that the faculty at Santa Cruz seemed to welcome and want to learn from students as well,&#8221; said Stewart. &#8220;And so my whole conception of what it meant to be a thinker changed when I was at UC Santa Cruz. And I think UC Santa Cruz does that better than any other university I&#8217;ve been at&#8212;to create a sense in which you engage in long discussions, deep thinking with peers, you take difficult stands, you argue, and you have professors who trick you out of your intellectual laziness which I think can come very easily.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Spring Awards celebration</strong> also included the presentation of the 2020-21 <i>Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award in Humanities</i> to associate professor of philosophy, Janette Dinishak.</span></p>
<p><span>Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the annual award is named in honor of the late emeritus professor <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/dizikes-obituary.html"><strong><em>John</em><em> Dizikes</em></strong></a>, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It was designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its impact on undergraduate students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We can become better thinkers by careful study of the works of great thinkers,&#8221; said Dinishak. &#8220;Philosophy is at once a discipline with its own subject matter and a collection of methods and styles of thinking one can apply across disciplines.&#160;To learn philosophy is to learn ideas and arguments but also meta-cognitive skills and styles of thinking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;These simple reflections inform three of my overarching teaching aims: to excite interest in the subject matter of philosophy, to nurture students&#8217; own philosophical responses to ideas they confront across the disciplines and in their everyday lives, and to become more careful interpreters of others&#8217; ideas,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In addition to being honored</strong>&#160;with the Dizikes Award, the faculty winner is also invited to award a $2,000 scholarship bearing their name to a student who has demonstrated outstanding academic achievement. Dinishak chose Alyssa Tamboura, a graduating senior with a double major&#160;in Philosophy and Legal Studies<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>An active participant with UCSC&#8217;s Center for Public Philosophy, Tamboura founded <i>Walls to Bridges</i>, a student-run, volunteer restorative justice program that uses mediated meetings between those incarcerated and their familes as a way to reconnect them. She is a contributing author to&#160;<em>Shut'em Down</em>, an anthology of 20 stories from black women who have been impacted by racism in the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Tamboura also received the <i>David A. Kadish Humanities Scholarship</i>, which is annually awarded to an undergraduate student with financial need who displays a strong interest in the study of the humanities.</span></p>
<p><span>"I&#8217;m incredibly honored and grateful to receive the Kadish Humanities Scholarship, and I want to give a special shout-out to my professors, mentors and colleagues in the Philosophy Department&#8212; particularly Jon Ellis, Kyle Robertson, and Janette Dinishak,&#8221; said Tamboura. &#8220;Without you three, my time at UC Santa Cruz wouldn&#8217;t have been as amazing and incredible as it was.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This award is so helpful and means so much to me,&#8221; she added. "It will help me as I transition from graduating from UC Santa Cruz to attending Yale Law School in the fall.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"></span></span></p>

The requirement aims to protect the health of all members of the UC community as well as the general public as we transition from remote work and instruction back to UC campuses.</p>
<p>The exact policy language and the systemwide implementation plan are still being crafted, but the Office of the President is sharing the decision to give students and employees as much time as possible to comply with the mandate. The finalized policy and an updated Q&amp;A are expected by July 15.</p>
<p>As outlined by the President&#8217;s Office, faculty, staff, students and others are expected to comply with the mandate two weeks before returning to campus or another UC location for the fall term. The same timeframe will apply for essential workers already on campus.</p>
<p>Our campus is preparing a process to record vaccination status with the expectation it will be ready by July 15, when students and employees will be required to begin uploading proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>The policy will allow for narrow medical exemptions consistent with federal <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html?s_cid%3D10493:us%2520vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623511647338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzRj5dAF5TBU-WTcyBwe21pyq3Mg" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html?s_cid=10493:us%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention guidance</a>. Requests for disability or religious accommodations will be handled through existing campus policies and procedures. Those with approved exemptions or accommodations may return to campus with the requirement that they remain masked in all public settings and comply with the campus testing protocol. Employees who choose not to be vaccinated and have no approved exemption, potentially put the health of others at risk and may face disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are a safe and effective way to prevent the virus that to date has killed nearly 600,000 Americans and more than 3.3 million people worldwide.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Cal/OSHA requirements will still impact employees working on-site</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One of the key state agencies impacting our campus operational requirements is Cal/OSHA. The </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623768682312000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPMMQ1E9ajBz3pfjLjOvd4E7MxcQ" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS)</span></a><span>, in place since November 30, remain in effect. </span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These standards currently require that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>all employees wear face coverings at the workplace, both indoors and outdoors, when employees are within six feet of each other</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>employees continue to be separated by 6 feet</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>solid partitions be used at all fixed work locations when physical distancing between persons is not feasible</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These standards also stipulate that asymptomatic fully vaccinated employees do not have to be excluded from the workplace when they have had close contact with someone who is positive for COVID-19.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Cal/OSHA standards board will meet again on June 17 and might adopt changes to these requirements. We will keep you posted as we learn more. In the meantime, we must follow the requirements outlined above.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz commencement festivities blended online ceremonies with jovial, in-person gatherings, including &#8220;Slug Crossings,&#8221; a chance for graduates to cross a stage on campus with their caps, gowns, and tassels while loved ones cheered them on.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was a spirited virtual-analog hybrid that felt like a cautious step toward normalcy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduates reserved blocks of time to have their names read and photos taken in an outdoor venue. The audience was strictly limited for safety reasons, with each student allowed only two guests, but the modest crowd had oversized enthusiasm.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirited onlookers cheered on each graduate, even those they didn't know. &#8220;Go, Abby! Well done, Michael. You rock, Caitlin! Woo, woo, Justin!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Bright spirits, brighter costumes&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No balloons were allowed, nor were there exploding confetti bombs, ear-piercing noisemakers, pets, or buzzing drones, but some of the loud, brash outfits more than compensated for the peacefulness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karla Soto Bravo (Porter '21, business management/economics) wore a graduation gown festooned with folded-up two-dollar bills for good luck, interwoven with yellow and blue paper showing off UCSC's school colors, and some purple flowers thrown into the mix for good measure.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Bravo was making the most of a grand occasion. This was understandable, considering that Bravo, a transfer student, had a mere six months of college living and in-person classes before the pandemic disrupted everything.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though her time as an in-person student was brief, it ranks among the best experiences of her life, Bravo said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget it," she said. &#8220;It was so calming to walk through a forest as I had to go take a final.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, COVID&#8217;s arrival was an important reminder of life&#8217;s unpredictability, Bravo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s true&#8212;you never know what is going to happen.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Egan (Merrill '21, molecular, cell and developmental biology), another participant in Slug Crossings, attended her final semester of classes remotely, yet she maintained a strong in-person connection to campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the fall, Egan has been working at UCSC&#8217;s COVID testing station at Merrill College, testing fellow students, staff, and faculty members for symptoms and walking them through the process of self-testing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Egan&#8217;s laboratory work, which went from in-person to virtual this year, pivoted to focus on COVID research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt good for Egan to do her part in combating the pandemic, but now it&#8217;s time for her to contemplate the next steps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No big plans right now," she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m moving back with my family to San Diego. Then I&#8217;m starting a job search.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the sidelines, students were taking advantage of the perfect weather, with less glare and heat than usual. Enjoying a nice crossbreeze from the ocean, they posed for photos in front of the Monterey Bay, whooped it up, and jumped around on the hillside.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Online ceremonies showed the strength of the human spirit</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://vgrad.z19.web.core.windows.net/ucsc/422/i/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Virtual Commencement Ceremony </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">also had a disarming, personal touch. Many of the students taking part in the festivities made sure to include a slide with special thanks and greetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank my parents, my professors, and my friends for supporting me in my college journey over the past five years (including one gap year!&#8221;) wrote Ivy Chen (College Nine '21, cognitive science).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a truly difficult year,&#8221; wrote Joel Stephen Moore (College Nine '21, politics and theater arts), &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t have chosen better people to go through it with!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cowell College commencement ceremony began with lovely views of forests and the sound of birdsong. Alice Folkins, college academic manager for Cowell, had &#8220;deceptively simple&#8221; words of wisdom for graduates:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My advice is to give a damn,&#8221; Folkins said. &#8220;Give a damn about yourself so you can advocate for yourself, even if you are full of doubt. Care about the people you surround yourself with so spending time with them nourishes your soul, and the work that you do grabs the attention of others, and together you impact the people around you.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a focused commitment &#8220;means constantly being engaged,&#8221; even when you are feeling weary, Folkins noted. &#8220;It means constantly pursuing the truth or truths whatever they may be. Perhaps the isolation, the uncertainty, the unrest of the past two years have taught you how difficult it is to give a damn, but I hope that you have also learned how important it is when you give something or someone your love and attention.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya Iverson-Davis (Ph.D. '21, sociology), the Black Grad commencement ceremony&#8217;s student keynote speaker, disarmed the crowd with her candor, directness, and wise counsel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year has completely changed the way we lived,&#8221; Iverson-Davis said. &#8220;Here we are graduating through all this uncertainty, stress, and mess. I keep asking my friends, &#8216;How do we do this? How do we turn feeling overwhelmed into determination? How do we stay focused and coherent when the world feels impossible and incomprehensible?'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The answer is usually a variation of &#8216;We had to do it&#8217; and &#8216;It was just time,&#8217; followed by silence and laughter,&#8221; Iverson-Davis continued. &#8220;Now I wonder if the silence and laughter were also answers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe those responses, said Davis, were a way of acknowledging &#8220;everyone who ever believed in our lives as exuberant and wondrous. I want you all to feel why we are here. Take a moment to gather the sacrifices, triumphs, and mischief. Let those memories flow through you like a current of love. Take what is helpful, leave behind what is not. Embrace everything good and spirited and the people who helped you get to this moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Memories of commencements past&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In virtual presentations, celebrated alumni had words of encouragement for the roughly 2,800 undergraduate students and 260 graduate students who had applied to graduate this spring. Just over 5,000 students earned undergraduate degrees from UC Santa Cruz this past year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his keynote remarks at the Oakes College ceremony, Forrest Stewart (Oakes &#8216;04, politics), associate professor of sociology at Stanford University and recipient of a MacArthur &#8220;genius&#8221; grant, said that being an Oakes graduate is one of the proudest achievements of his life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart&#8217;s work focuses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the societal underpinnings of poverty and criminalization across disciplines and has been influenced both by his childhood and the formative experiences of his undergraduate education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So much of my journey began at Oakes, alongside brilliant friends and faculty,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;Whether it was designing federal lawsuits to fight police brutality in Los Angeles, or whether it&#8217;s launching after-school programs in Chicago to help young people process violence and trauma, or maybe it&#8217;s writing books that celebrate the voices of long-neglected communities, I can trace all of these to the conversations I had and the lessons I learned at Oakes."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her keynote remarks for Rachel Carson College, Molly Harriss Olson (Rachel Carson '82, economics and environmental science),</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO of Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand, beamed in from Melbourne, Australia, right in the middle of her country&#8217;s fourth lockdown.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are lucky to have only a few cases, but when it gets out of the bag, we really do lock down!&#8221; said Olson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olson works for a member-based trade organization with chapters that support systems of fair trade across the globe. She credited her time at UCSC with giving her a &#8220;really full, integrated view of the world.&#8221; She said UCSC students who have lived through a year of challenges, including distance learning, received a crash course in complex global relationships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A pandemic can influence our perception of what is possible," she said. &#8220;The world faces some very great problems right now. The world needs you more than ever, with a clear understanding of the systemic solutions we all need.&#8221; She urged graduates to work toward a more habitable planet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baskin Engineering grads listened to life advice from marketing specialist, author, and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Guy Kawasaki, a Santa Cruz resident and committed surfer. Kawasaki&#8217;s latest passion is his </span><a href="https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarkable People Podcast. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I bet that many have advised you along the lines of &#8216;pursue your passion,&#8217;&#8221; Kawasaki said. &#8220;In my humble opinion, that theory is overrated because very few things start immediately as a passion. How many of you developed an instant passion for Python, debugging, or user interface?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kawasaki said it made far more sense to &#8220;lower your expectations and your standards and just look for things that interest you, little murmurs that rise above the noise. This lower bar has lots of positive effects. You get exposure to far more things and it works out well because right now you have an abundance of time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pursuing one&#8217;s interests is not always fun,&#8221; Kawasaki continued. &#8220;In fact, it could take years. The process is almost guaranteed to be difficult and time- consuming, but what I found is that it is easy to love something you are immediately good at, and hard to love something that you [don&#8217;t do well at first]. But this second kind of love is longer lasting and ultimately more rewarding.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In closing, Kawasaki advised: &#8220;When your friends tell you you are working too long and too hard at something, you are probably on the right track.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Her findings will be important in numerous areas&#8212;from sustainable food to social justice to biodiversity. The research is just one aspect of SEACoast, a new program that is fulfilling the promises of slow science. <br/>
<h3>Slow science is making fast progress at UC Santa Cruz</h3>
Established in 2019, the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/seacoast/">Southeast Asian Coastal Interactions Initiative, or SEACoast</a>, has created a collaborative hub where social and natural scientists work together to tackle complex environmental problems. <br/><br/>&#8220;In this time of human-caused environmental challenges, we need to agree that human histories and nonhuman histories are part of the same set of research challenges,&#8221; says Anna Tsing, professor of anthropology, who is codirecting the center with Megan Thomas, associate professor of political science.<br/><br/>Since the SEACoast center was funded with a five-year $1 million grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, interest and participation in the center&#8217;s programming has been growing rapidly. Emphasizing &#8220;slow science,&#8221; which values deliberation, field observation, and historical inquiry over fast results, SEACoast has drawn academics from a broad spectrum of disciplines together to offer their expertise, learn from others, and synthesize new ideas for research.<br/><br/>One of SEACoast&#8217;s projects explores the multifaceted phenomenon of harmful algal blooms. Caused by alterations in ocean nutrients, winds, temperatures, or a combination of these factors, algal blooms create toxic conditions that threaten the survival of various species in coastal waters. Interestingly, it is an anthropologist at UC Santa Cruz, Ph.D. student Zahirah Suhaimi, who is working to solve this environmental puzzle, piecing together knowledge from the fields of microbiology, ethnography, history, and human behavior. <br/>
<h3>Many cooks in the kitchen&#8212;uncommon collaboratives</h3>
<p>Suhaimi&#8217;s dissertation looks at the relationship between microscopic algal species and human populations. Algae are primary producers&#8212;they float around in marine environments and get eaten by zooplankton and shellfish. They are building blocks of life. But they can also destroy life if they are toxic and reproduce in large quantities. These toxins work their way up the food chain onto our plates. Also, while photosynthetic algae species overgrow during daytime in the presence of light, in the dark, they produce massive amounts of deadly carbon dioxide. They can literally smother marine life in anoxic waters or waters with very low oxygen levels.<br/><br/>At the onset of her fieldwork in 2018, Suhaimi was faced with the challenge of finding a scientific lab willing to integrate a social scientist into their team. On a tour of mangroves in Singapore, Suhaimi met Federico Lauro, a professor of microbiology at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. They put their ideas together and kicked off collaborative research, looking at anthropological data and microbiological analysis to understand environmental phenomena over time. <br/><br/>It is at the intersection of social and natural science where Suhaimi gets most excited about her work. She feels she is onto something when her ethnographic data or historical data finds resonance with the scientific data that&#8217;s available.<br/><br/>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m gathering potential pieces of a big puzzle,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure how they fit together, or if they even fit at all.&#8221; <br/><br/>For instance, water currents shape microalgal species populations and distributions. Fishing communities use the currents when building floating fish farms. Lower current speeds are preferred for fish farms, but this also means weak dispersal of algal biomass, which increases the likelihood of harmful algal bloom. <br/><br/>&#8220;So, these pieces of the puzzle, they fit,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But they fit awkwardly, in the sense that what makes aquaculture successful is also what puts it at risk.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Investment in a transdisciplinary experiment</h3>
<p>Figuring out this tension on a global scale is crucial to food supplies and overall sustainability. <br/><br/>Before the pandemic, Suhaimi followed coastal fishing communities. She learned about their way of interacting with the coastal waters and studied their practices, habits, and knowledge. She discovered immense creativity in these communities, as well as established scientific practices. While Suhaimi&#8217;s colleagues in microbiology rely on their water sampling filters to document changes, coastal communities observe changes in the coloration, or they experience changes through their interactions with the water where they make a living. <br/><br/>For Suhaimi, a multiplicity of sciences tell the story of coastal conditions over time, and all voices are needed in the search for solutions. <br/><br/>In the long run, when she is able to narrow down decisive factors, Suhaimi&#8217;s findings can inform policymaking in terms of managing human activities in coastal waters. Her research can determine the kind of environmental monitoring that would be necessary to keep both scientists and the public informed.</p>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz previously didn&#8217;t have a department focused on Southeast Asian studies, the campus is nevertheless particularly well equipped to offer unconventional contributions to the field. SEACoast is drawing on the university&#8217;s expertise and recognition in ocean science, social justice, and environmental studies, as well as its tradition of bridging departmental divides with a mindset for collaboration.</p>
<h3>Building blocks of a new research hub</h3>
SEACoast has established its presence as an institution on campus and is quickly becoming a lively intellectual center, thriving on exactly what it set out to do: galvanize diverse academic experts interested in charting new territory. Reaching beyond institutional structures provides an opportunity for creatively thinking about human-caused environmental challenges. <br/><br/>SEACoast&#8217;s slow seminar on harmful algal blooms, led by Marilou Sison-Mangus, assistant professor of ocean sciences, ultimately led to the funding of a collaboration grant for Suhaimi. <br/><br/>For Tsing, one of the most exciting developments of SEACoast&#8217;s inaugural year has been facilitating the<br/>hiring of a new faculty member in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s History Department. Kathleen Gutierrez is a<br/>scholar of Southeast Asian environmental history, and her research focuses on botanical<br/>collecting in the Philippines across colonial and post-colonial eras. <br/><br/>Tsing is thrilled with the positive reception at UC Santa Cruz and the rapid growth of the intellectual hub in producing promising international dialogues and collaborations. She has many plans for the center. She&#8217;s fundraising for scholarships and is in negotiations with Indonesian government agencies to include UC Santa Cruz among universities authorized to enroll Indonesian students in environmental sciences. <br/><br/>SEACoast continues to break open departmental discourse into collaborative discourse.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zimmer&#8217;s Watershed Hydrology lab studies the pathways water takes through landscapes, especially the poorly understood subsurface movements of water through soil and bedrock. When rainfall soaks into the ground, it can replenish soil water, recharge groundwater, generate stream flow, and be taken up by plant roots, ultimately returning to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration by plants. Zimmer&#8217;s group is interested in how the subsurface structure controls the partitioning of water into these different pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the big unknowns for predicting the effects of climate change on the water cycle is our poor understanding of how water is stored and moved in soil and bedrock,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Climate scientists are predicting more year-to-year variability in precipitation and more extreme weather events, and this has implications for the management of water resources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zimmer&#8217;s field site at the UC Blue Oak Ranch Reserve on the west slope of Mt. Hamilton features an extensive array of hydrological instruments her team has installed to monitor water movement. The new grant will help accelerate the research at this site and enable the research group to dig deeper, both metaphorically and literally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Part of this funding will go toward drilling deep bore holes to allow us to peer into the subsurface and see its structure and how it regulates water movement and storage,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant will also support education and outreach efforts to attract students with diverse backgrounds, ideas, and experiences into the Earth sciences. The program will include developing environmental justice-themed hydrology modules for existing online high school and undergraduate courses that reach more than 500 students annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understanding subsurface hydrology is critical for developing effective water resource policies and addressing socioeconomic inequalities, and we need to broaden the diversity of people who are involved in this topic,&#8221; Zimmer said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zimmer will also partner with local water managers to address the uncertainty in their regional streamflow predictions. The field site forms the headwaters of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which serves water for about 2 million people in San Jose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The award provides $587,000 over five years to support Zimmer&#8217;s research, education, and outreach activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zimmer earned her B.A. in environmental studies at Oberlin College, M.S. in Earth sciences at Syracuse University, and Ph.D. in Earth and ocean sciences at Duke University. She joined the UCSC faculty in 2018.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20d923e08072704647a15c5169727b18"><name>juneteenth-holiday</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>President Drake announces Juneteenth a new UC holiday</title><summary>Yesterday President Biden declared a federal holiday for Juneteenth, the day that celebrates and commemorates the end of slavery in the United States.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her sophomore year of high school, Olivia Ross (Kresge '20, astrophysics), winner of this year&#8217;s prestigious Steck Family Award, learned to channel anxious energies into scientific pursuits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I directed all my angsty, existential teen moments of &#8216;what does it all mean?&#8217; toward learning about the history of the universe,&#8221; Ross said. &#8220;I mean, what&#8217;s more existential than that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This redirected life force moves her forward. While attending Santa Rosa High School as a homeschool student, she also earned associate&#8217;s degrees in math, engineering, natural sciences, and physics from Santa Rosa Junior College, while holding down a part-time job.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, which is probably why I did it,&#8221; Ross said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To pull off this feat, Ross devoted herself to college on weekdays, and high school studies on weekends. She graduated from both high school and junior college in June 2017 when she was 18.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That focused ambition increased at UC Santa Cruz, when Ross took on even more daunting tasks, including her celebrated thesis project, &#8220;Searching for Primordial Black Holes,&#8221; which impressed the judges with its resourcefulness and innovation.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her project, in collaboration with her faculty mentor Stefano Profumo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">physics professor and director of graduate studies for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Department of Physics, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies the possibility of detecting primordial black holes using pulsars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross&#8217;s passion for large, difficult projects, and the rigor of her scientific method, wowed Profumo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She is, simply, a one-in-a-generation gem,&#8221; Profumo wrote in February, in a letter of recommendation for the Dean&#8217;s and Chancellor&#8217;s Awards, both of which Ross received.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profumo called her &#8220;an exceptionally talented scholar, a gritty, motivated, exceptionally smart researcher, and plainly an incredibly good collaborator.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Steck Award is given once a year to one UC Santa Cruz undergraduate, and recognizes the most outstanding research out of the 15 Chancellor&#8217;s Award honorees. The award also honors the care, work and guidance of the honoree's faculty mentor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loren Steck (Porter '73), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, has described the award as a truly special honor for UCSC students: "Only the best undergraduates nowadays do senior theses," Steck said. "Only the best of the best of them receive Dean&#8217;s Awards. Only the best of the best of the best of them get Chancellor&#8217;s Awards."</span></p>
<p><strong>A restless spirit&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk and ambition have fueled Ross since she took the first steps toward being a scientist at age 3. That&#8217;s when she first became obsessed with mathematics, a passion that led her toward science in high school, where she realized that daunting problem sets and laboratory experiments could be emotional as well as intellectual outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross has never chosen the easier path. If anything, she always picks the steepest and most slippery slope.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After high school, Ross took some well-deserved time off to travel through 33 of the United States and a small piece of Canada over a four-month period, then spent three months backpacking in Europe, including the Camino de Santiago trek.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arriving in UC Santa Cruz in 2018, Ross went through an academic identity crisis. She was not sure whether to call herself a first-year student or a transfer. But soon, she fell in with some good friends, lost herself in peaceful redwoods, and started her project with Profumo.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His support helped her get over her initial unease. &#8220;I was absolutely terrified when I started research,&#8221; Ross said. &#8220;I had no idea how to do any of it. The grad students and professors were all so cool and intimidating, and I could not read a scientific paper to save my life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"[But] Stefano is such a supportive mentor to all his students,&#8221; Ross said. &#8220;I&#8217;m so lucky to have him as an adviser.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross had learned about Profumo&#8217;s research and was keen on starting to work with him as soon as possible. She had a clear vision of what she wanted to work on: the question of whether primordial black holes could or could not be dark matter, Profumo recalled.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was very impressed both by her resolve and by her passion and was delighted when she started to work with my best graduate student, Benjamin Lehmann, on a project involving the gravitational capture of black holes in planetary, and more broadly, binary systems,&#8221; Profumo said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Overcoming obstacles&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ross, for all of her hard work and self-motivation, has faced obstacles along the way, including mood disorders. During the height of her academic career at UC Santa Cruz, where she enrolled in 2018, she put in long hours while coping with stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve always struggled with anxiety and depression," Ross said. "So the times when I was barely getting my homework turned in because it took all my strength to get out of bed or when I was so anxious I couldn&#8217;t even look at my advisers without freaking out, of course it was hard to get my work done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I&#8217;ve learned a couple things,&#8221; Ross noted. &#8220;Putting off a meeting because you haven&#8217;t accomplished anything will always make you less productive. Just tell your adviser you need more direction and try again. Secondly, professors and grad students are real human beings, who are generally familiar with mental illnesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you&#8217;re sick, you can tell them. I&#8217;m still working on that one. But for me, learning to talk about mental illness as I would any other illness has made a huge impact on my personal and professional life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><strong>On the hunt for primordial black holes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross&#8217;s thesis project quests after primordial black holes, so named because they formed very soon after the Big Bang.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The black holes we&#8217;re used to hearing about form from the death of stars, and because stars behave in certain ways, there are strict constraints on the types of black holes they produce in their deaths,&#8221; Ross explained.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, black holes that formed during the early history of the universe&#8212;primordial black holes&#8212;would not have to fall within these constraints.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They could be as small as the head of a pin or as big as 100 suns,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for these potentially small primordial objects became the latest in Ross&#8217;s endless list of daunting tasks. She chose a topic that she knew would test her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, how do you look for something you can&#8217;t see?&#8221; she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross and Ben Lehmann, the graduate student she was working with, decided to use pulsars as a tool to seek the primordial black holes. Pulsars&#8212;which are neutron stars left over from when a star turns into a supernova but is not quite big enough to form a black hole&#8212;emit beams of light, &#8220;allowing us to see when something is orbiting a pulsar without seeing the object itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A driving force</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross graduated magna cum laude in summer 2020. She is eager to start work this fall at Cornell University&#8217;s Ph.D. program in astronomy. She will study large-scale structure, which she describes as &#8220;the study of how and why matter is distributed throughout the universe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, she can see just how far she&#8217;s come. Because of her early pursuit of four associates degrees, &#8220;my college career started when I was 15, so a lot has changed,&#8221; Ross observed. &#8220;I think the main thing is confidence. When I started, I had all these plans about doing community college as a teenager and homeschooling for high school and doing a U.S. road trip by myself. And nobody believed I could do any of it, which was honestly fair enough. But I did all that and more.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Bullock, who graduated last week, punctuating a busy time in college&#8212;one that includes obtaining her degree in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology with honors, serving on the Student Union Assembly since her first year of college, and becoming Vice President of Student Life for three terms&#8212;with sometimes registering 10-hour days at a skilled nursing facility as she works toward a career as a physician assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went surfing and to the gym in my free time and went out with my friends,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;And I promise I mostly got eight hours of sleep every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>But mostly, Bullock kept a busy schedule, exercising diligence to meet her academic obligations while working toward the 2,000 hours of patient care experience required to gain entry into a physician assistant program. A physician assistant is a medical professional who can diagnose illness, devise treatment plans and prescribe medication as a patient&#8217;s primary care provider, working under the supervision of a physician.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized I wanted to be a physician assistant when I started my coursework at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;I saw a huge emphasis on social justice and racial justice and began to learn how socioeconomic status and race plays into one&#8217;s health.&#8221;</p>
<p>The physician assistant role was developed in the mid&#8211;60s to improve and expand healthcare when the United States was facing a shortage of primary care physicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PA&#8217;s role coincides with social justice by serving underserved communities,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;They help reach the pinnacle in healthcare, which is to provide access to high-quality healthcare to more people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullock knew from a very early age she wanted to pursue a career in medicine despite having no one in her family in the profession. Bullock dealt with chronic health problems as a child, routinely contracting pneumonia and other serious lung ailments as most of her peers recovered from what were often common colds.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was 10-years-old I had pneumonia for a week and I got better, but then I relapsed and I lost about 20 pounds in a week,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;It was brutal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullock and her San Diego-based family were cycling through doctors in quest of answers when Bullock met a Physician Assistant who dramatically altered the course of her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met a really great PA who told me I actually had allergies that caused me to get sick,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The PA diagnosed her with asthma and prescribed basic allergy medicine which helped her end the cycle of contracting increasingly serious ailments.</p>
<p>&#8220;She took a more holistic view of my health in order to better understand my care,&#8221; Bullock says.</p>
<p>So Bullock wanted to emulate that approach to health and set about it as soon as she landed at UC Santa Cruz. But she also wanted to incorporate her passion for social justice and leadership into her college career so she became involved in student government from the outset.</p>
<p>That passion too was informed by her childhood. Of mixed ethnicity growing up in a suburb of San Diego, there were times when classmates could be casually or explicitly demeaning to Bullock, who is Black, Filipino, South Korean, and white.</p>
<p>When she arrived at UC Santa Cruz, she immediately became involved in various programs that helped her peers overcome challenging circumstances that can be tough for individuals to navigate while trying to excel academically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it was food justice or social justice, I wanted to advocate for everything related to students&#8217; basic needs,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Her involvement from an early stage led her to win an election to become the Vice President of Student Life (VPSL) during her sophomore year. Bullock is now finishing her third term as VPSL, the first Vice President since the creation of the Student Union Assembly to have served three consecutive terms.</p>
<p>Some of her accomplishments include a renovation of the SUA Food Pantry, including the implementation of garden planters so students can grow their own herbs and vegetables.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted students to be more connected to the food they ate,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She organized and hosted culturally appropriate cooking classes with various student organizations, in some cases showcasing popular recipes from Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Through founding the Student Advocate&#8217;s Office during her second term, she advocated for students caught up in various disciplinary processes as a result of campus strikes or other protest activities. She helped lobby for revisions to the Student Code of Conduct and also helped raise and award $200,000 in emergency housing funds to students in need of secure housing affected by the year-long closure of campus due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Her sophomore year, she helped put on a concert featuring Sage the Gemini with the goal of fostering a greater sense of community spirit. Not everyone was on board with spending money on a concert, but Bullock says she learned as much about navigating the treacherous terrain of contemporary politics as she did about the logistics of hosting a concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was studying for my organic chemistry exam at the time,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;I remember studying my O-Chem textbook in between giving stage directions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullock also worked hundreds of hours as a volunteer at local healthcare facilities in and around Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I received my certificate to become a nursing assistant, and I worked at a skilled nursing facility 2 or 3 times a week where I would see anywhere from 20 to 40 patients,&#8221; Bullock says.</p>
<p>She would often attend classes from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., completing assignments as she went, before her work would begin at 2:30 p.m. and run as late as 11 p.m., depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a ridiculous workload at times,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But the diligence has paid off. Bullock will graduate with and has accrued enough hours providing patient care to qualify for a Physician Assistant Program that she hopes to begin in the fall. Many of those hours were served during an unprecedented global pandemic that strained the abilities and mental toughness of some of the most experienced healthcare workers in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time at the beginning where we were sharing personal protective equipment,&#8221; she says. &#8220;When you are sharing equipment it is neither personal or protective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullock did contract Covid last summer but was fortunate enough to bounce back in due time and resume her efforts to help others weather the very arduous storm.</p>
<p>Now a year later, about to accept a diploma that represents her acumen and work ethic, Bullock says she is eager to move on to the next phase of a career predicated on helping others.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="24fc409e8072704647a15c51d56b0091"><name>juneteenth</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Juneteenth: A day to celebrate creativity, community and resilience</title><summary>The campus commemoration of Juneteenth is set for Friday, June 25, and this year’s event is especially meaningful, as it follows the news that federal leaders are making Juneteenth a national holiday.</summary><start-date>1623999600000</start-date><display-name>Juneteenth: A day to celebrate creativity, community and resilience</display-name><path>/2021/06/juneteenth</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/juneteenth</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1624118149252</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1624118163217</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>By Adrienne Harrell, Madlyn Norman-Terrance, Rhonda Rhodes, Audries Blake, Aaron Jones, Marc-Emile Johnston, and Irene Diaz Martinez, members of the UC Santa Cruz Juneteenth Organizing Committee</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The campus commemoration of Juneteenth is set for Friday, June 25, and this year&#8217;s event is especially meaningful, as it follows the news that federal leaders are making Juneteenth a national holiday. UC announced today it will add Juneteenth to its <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/06/a-message-to-the-uc-community-from-president-drake.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624204288064000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-uExOxHcZXp3XFZuiZlrfjPh6Mw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/06/a-message-to-the-uc-community-from-president-drake.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calendar of holidays</a>. The theme of this year&#8217;s campus event is &#8220;Celebrating Creativity, Community and Resilience,&#8221; and the organizing committee invites all in the UC Santa Cruz community to join us.</p>
<p>Juneteenth, or June 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day or Jubilee Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 when a Union general informed enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended and that they were free. That was two-and-a-half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in the Southern states.</p>
<p>Juneteenth is a time for celebration, reflection, remembrance, and examination. In 2021, 156 years after that day in Texas, we must together face a sad and frustrating truth: There is still much work to be done in our nation, our communities and on our campus for Black people to achieve true equity and equality. Over the past two years, Americans and global citizens of all backgrounds have awakened to the reality that anti-Black racism remains deeply interwoven in our nation&#8217;s fabric.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. noted that the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice. We believe this to be true, but know that bending does not occur by chance. It takes work, and part of that work is raising our voices in the face of injustice whenever and wherever we see it, even when doing so is sometimes uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by the fact that so many people, particularly young people, are demanding change.</p>
<p>One way to lend support for Black equality is by recognizing important Black milestones like Juneteenth. Our hope is that by reflecting on the holiday&#8217;s history, we are educating people in our campus community. Celebrating the anniversary also allows us to join together in the name of justice and equality.</p>
<p>We encourage you to use tomorrow, June 19, next week&#8217;s campus commemoration and the day UC will observe Juneteenth, June 28, as an opportunity to think deeply about the ways in which racism persists in our country &#8212; in everything from education to employment, policing to politics, and housing to health care. It takes courage to confront systemic problems, and we are encouraged that our campus community is taking a hard look at what we can do better and discussing concrete actions with campus stakeholders.</p>
<p>If we want racial justice to move beyond aspiration, it requires all of us to commit to what actions we can take. We remain hopeful that better days are ahead.</p>

<p>Eric Sneathen, a graduate student in literature, acknowledges that aesthetics and politics are largely inextricable, but that his own scholarship hews more closely to the exploration of the political.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am much more interested in literary history and archival work,&#8221; Sneathen says. &#8220;I enjoy talking to people about their lived experience and then analyze how that lines up, or how it doesn&#8217;t, with the literary canon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, Sneathen, who is gay, explores how gay men, beginning in the 1960s, formed a literary community, wrote or curated poems and other literary works about their experiences, and how this community informed the more recent social movements around gay identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a self-consciously gay literary culture,&#8221; Sneathen says of a movement in the Bay Area after the Stonewall Riots in 1969. &#8220;They had their own presses, their own networks and their own literary celebrities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sneathen is thinking of literary figures like Robert Gluck, Kevin Killian, Paul Mariah and Donald Allen. All four were prominent participants in the burgeoning gay literary scene in San Francisco during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are not necessarily famous writers,&#8221; Sneathen says. &#8220;But one of the arguments I make in my dissertation is that we should know who these people are and I explore why they have become marginalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take Donald Allen in particular.</p>
<p>He was not a poet himself, but as an editor, he championed the work of many of the more famous literary artists of his day.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an editor and a tastemaker,&#8221; Sneathen says. &#8220;We typically don&#8217;t talk about editors the same way we do writers, but that is to our deficit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen worked for a 16-year spell at Grove Press and was tremendously influential in what the imprint brought to press including translating the famed absurdist dramas of French playwright Eugene Ionesco. He edited the works of the poet Frank O&#8217;Hara, a dynamic poetic talent and leader of the &#8220;New York School&#8221; of poetry. But Allen spent much of his adult career in San Francisco, where he helped edit self-consciously gay poetry and prose, but also helped shape the work of authors like Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Charles Olsen, Joanne Kyger and Richard Brautigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thread of my argument is that through the underground gay community, people like Allen drew on their social life to produce gay literature, but even straight poets like Charles Olsen came into Allen&#8217;s orbit through his connection to gay poets,&#8221; Sneathen says.</p>
<p>So Sneathen&#8217;s book is not as much of an investigation into the aesthetic concerns of the gay literary culture in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s as it is an investigation into how the social milieu of the social movement helped produce a distinctive literary movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get to the &#8217;70s social movement writers, they are sometimes writing from this confessional expressive mode and they are dismissed as a result,&#8221; Sneathen says. &#8220;They were not achieving these impersonal standards of the various avant-garde movements at the time. There was a tension between the avant-garde, which was arguing for doing away with the personal, and minority writers and feminists, who were insisting the personal and political were inextricable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sneathen&#8217;s work also explores the ways in which one movement was sanctioned by the academy as canon, while the other movement was viewed as a fringe with its inclusion viewed as debatable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think gay literature, like feminist literature or ethnic literature, were viewed as supplements to canonical literature,&#8221; Sneathen says. &#8220;That can be true of course, but it can also be true that the contributions of gay authors are fundamental to the canon as we know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Sneathen wrestles with &#8220;questions about authorship and literary production,&#8221; he is busy producing his own literary works as well. At the end of the month, a book by Camille Roy edited by Sneathen is slated for publication. Called <em>Honey Mine</em>, the book is a collection of experimental short stories with explicitly lesbian and queer themes.</p>
<p>He published a book of poetry called <em>Snail Poems</em>, calling it an extended elegy for a friend who died in Morrocco while working for the U.S. Peace Corps. He authored another chapbook <em>I Fill This Room With the Echo of Many Voices</em>, a collection of sonnets that explores the unfair stigmatization of Gaetan Dugas, who was misidentified as &#8220;Patient Zero&#8221; for the North American Aids epidemic.</p>
<p>Sneathen says the poems allowed him to wrestle with the implications of perceptions around a historical figure, which in turn, allowed him to contextualize his own biography. Growing up in San Diego, he realized as early as sixth grade that he was &#8220;very clearly attracted to men.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Amelia Wolf, an assistant professor of integrative biology at The University of Texas at Austin, created experimental plots at a site near San Jose that contained a typical mix of native plants, minus those that are most sensitive to drought, to determine what would happen if the plants that ecologists expect to be hit hardest by drought actually disappeared.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team used a 30-year dataset of plant surveys to determine which species did poorly during drought years, and they based their decisions of which species to exclude from their plots on those data. Their findings showed that, absent the drought-sensitive plants, the remaining plants in the plots grew less&#8212;a result known as lower productivity&#8212;than corresponding plants from another set of experimental plots where some species had been randomly excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results show how biodiversity loss field experiments that mimic &#8220;realistic species loss&#8221; can reveal greater impacts on ecosystems than more traditional study designs, where ecologists select species to remove at random. The research team ran their experiment for three years: during a wet year, a normal year, and a drought year. Even during drought years, the drought tolerant plants that were left behind in the plots with realistic species loss didn&#8217;t grow as big as their counterparts in the traditional plots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another critical ecosystem function, the ability to resist invasive species, varied widely from year to year over the course of the experiment. This suggests that complex interactions between species traits and varying climate have great influence in these outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the study&#8217;s findings could help to inform conservation strategies and lead to more accurate predictions about what ecosystems will look like in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re building a framework to understand what losing species means,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;That gives conservation managers an opportunity to anticipate and to manage ecosystems to preserve certain species and also to mitigate for declines in other species.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers are now working on a follow-up study to determine whether their results apply more broadly to other ecosystems around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Species have important impacts within an ecosystem, and they have effects that we can quantify &#8212; and if some species are gone, ecosystems will change in a quantifiable way,&#8221; Wolf said. &#8220;Some of these changes might not be noticeable to most people, but many of these changes are likely to be consequential for humans.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Deutsch details how a group of determined Holocaust survivors survived in one of the roughest parts of New York City&#8212;reshaping the urban landscape of postwar Brooklyn and successfully dealing with the challenges of poverty, street crime, deindustrialization, and gentrification.</span></p>
<p><span>Co-authored with Michael Casper, <i>A Fortress in Brooklyn: Race, Real Estate, and the Making of Hasidic Williamsburg </i>is a deep study of the Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, one of the most intensely religious, politically savvy, little known, and misunderstood groups in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>By showing how the embattled community rejected assimilation, while at the same time undergoing distinctive forms of Americanization and racialization, it offers a provocative counter-history of American Jewry, as well as a critical new look at how race, real estate, and religion intersected in the creation of the New York neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Most histories of American Jewry focus on the great waves of Jewish immigrants that arrived at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century and settled in neighborhoods like the Lower East Side in New York,&#8221; Deutsch noted. &#8220;Then, in the following decades and especially after World War II, most of these Jews and their descendants largely assimilated into mainstream American society, gave up speaking Yiddish, moved to the suburbs, and ceased to be Orthodox.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;By contrast, our book focuses on a smaller but, as we argue, very significant wave of Hasidic Jews who arrived in the United States after World War II, settled in Brooklyn, and refused to give up Yiddish, assimilate, or abandon Orthodoxy.&#160;Instead, they doubled down on what made them different and remained in New York, even as so many other Jews and white ethnics were abandoning the city in the 1960s and 70s.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This is important today,&#8221; he added, &#8220;because Hasidim&#8212;and Haredim more generally&#8212;are by far the fastest growing demographic within the broader American Jewish community and if current trends continue, they will be a much more significant segment of the Jewish population in the United States, as well as in Israel, Great Britain, and elsewhere, in the near future. This has dramatic implications for the future of global Jewry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Deutsch and Casper researched</strong> the book for more than a decade, conducting interviews with Hasidic community members, as well as others in the neighborhood. They looked through years of Yiddish language newspapers and other media produced by the Hasidic community; Yiddish and Hebrew books published by Hasidim; and more recently, posts in online Hasidic chat rooms and websites (&#8220;despite the efforts of Hasidic community leaders to limit internet use among their members,&#8221; Deutsch noted).&#160;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The authors also examined federal census records, economic reports, government records, real estate publications, as well as numerous books and articles on the history of Williamsburg, New York City, urban studies, and gentrification.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to being a history professor, Deutsch is also the Murray Baumgarten Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies, the faculty director of The Humanities Institute, and director of the Center for Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz. He explained why the Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is so deeply misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;First, there is a long history of stereotyping Jews, in general, and Orthodox Jews, in particular.&#160;Because they signify Jewishness so explicitly and unequivocally in their dress, language, practices, and so on, Hasidim are often targeted with these stereotypes. Second, the Hasidic community in Williamsburg has long sought to segregate itself in order to protect its distinctive way of life&#8212;which it considers to be holy&#8212;from negative outside influences. This, in turn, has contributed to a lack of knowledge of the community by outsiders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We hope that readers will see the Hasidic community in Williamsburg as dynamic, complex, and changing, even as its&#160;members have always stressed their loyalty to tradition,&#8221; Deutsch added. &#8220;Connected to that, we hope that readers will come to appreciate how much Hasidim in Williamsburg and in Brooklyn, more generally, have helped to shape their environment and, in the process, contributed significantly to the history of New York City.&#8221;</span>&#160;</p>

<p>The study, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, suggests that the NASA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled to launch in November, will be sensitive enough to observe the birth of galaxies directly.</p>
<p>The research team examined six of the most distant galaxies currently known, whose light has taken most of the universe&#8217;s lifetime to reach us. They found that the distance of these galaxies away from Earth corresponded to a &#8220;look back&#8221; time of more than 13 billion years ago, when the universe was only 550 million years old.</p>
<p>Analyzing images from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, the researchers calculated the age of these galaxies as ranging from 200 to 300 million years, allowing an estimate of when their stars first formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;These galaxies push the forefront of our knowledge about cosmic structure formation even further back in time,&#8221; said Brant Robertson, Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and co-author of the study. &#8220;They presage what the next generation of space telescopes will discover in the early universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lead author Nicolas Laporte with the University of Cambridge, who started the project while at UCL, said: &#8220;Theorists speculate that the universe was a dark place for the first few hundred million years, before the first stars and galaxies formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Witnessing the moment when the universe was first bathed in starlight is a major quest in astronomy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our observations indicate that cosmic dawn occurred between 250 and 350 million years after the beginning of the universe, and, at the time of their formation, galaxies such as the ones we studied would have been sufficiently luminous to be seen with the James Webb Space Telescope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed starlight from the galaxies as recorded by the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, examining a marker in their energy distribution indicative of the presence of atomic hydrogen&#8212;hydrogen that has not been split into protons and electrons&#8212; in their stellar atmospheres. This provides an estimate of the age of the stars they contain.</p>
<p>This hydrogen signature increases in strength as the stellar population ages but diminishes when the galaxy is older than a billion years. The age-dependence arises because the more massive stars that contribute to this signal burn their nuclear fuel more rapidly and therefore die first.</p>
<p>Co-author&#160; Romain Meyer with UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany said: &#8220;This age indicator is used to date stars in our own neighbourhood in the Milky Way but it can also be used to date extremely remote galaxies, seen at a very early period of the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using this indicator we can infer that, even at these early times, our galaxies are between 200 and 300 million years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>In analyzing the data from Hubble and Spitzer, the researchers needed to estimate the &#8220;redshift&#8221; of each galaxy which indicates their cosmological distance and hence the look-back time at which they are being observed. To achieve this, they undertook spectroscopic measurements using the full armoury of powerful ground-based telescopes &#8211; the Chilean Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA), the European Very Large Telescope, the twin Keck telescopes in Hawaii, and Gemini-South telescope.&#160;</p>
<p>These measurements enabled the team to confirm that looking at these galaxies corresponded to looking back to a time when the universe was 550 million years old.</p>

<p>Co-author and University College London Professor Richard Ellis, who has tracked ever more distant galaxies over his career, said: &#8220;Over the last decade, astronomers have pushed back the frontiers of what we can observe to a time when the universe was only 4% of its present age. However, due to the limited transparency of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and the capabilities of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, we have reached our limit.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now eagerly await the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, which we believe has the capability to directly witness cosmic dawn.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The quest to see this important moment in the universe&#8217;s history has been a holy grail in astronomy for decades. Since we are made of material processed in stars, this is in some sense the search for our own origins.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a2c660c8072704647a15c5186e222e5"><name>pumas-pandemic-lockdowns</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tracking data show how the quiet of pandemic-era lockdowns allowed pumas to venture closer to urban areas</title><summary>During regional shelter-in-place orders, declining levels of human mobility emboldened local pumas to use habitats they would normally avoid out of fear of humans.</summary><start-date>1624431600000</start-date><display-name>Pandemic lockdown effects on pumas</display-name><path>/2021/06/pumas-pandemic-lockdowns</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/pumas-pandemic-lockdowns</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1624473626100</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1624563104362</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/driveway_2019_500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/driveway_2019_500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>driveway_2019_500.jpg</name><display-name>driveway_2019_500.jpg</display-name><file-size>63024</file-size><width>500</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>A puma walking between cars in a driveway in front of a house</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/driveway_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/driveway_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>driveway_80.jpg</name><display-name>driveway_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>19628</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A puma crouching next to a car in a driveway</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Images like this one, captured by a home-security camera in 2019, are rare.

Wilmers et al., 2021, Current Biology</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New research from the University of California, Santa Cruz shows how regional shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic emboldened local pumas to use habitats they would normally avoid due to their fear of humans. This study, published in the journal </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00879-4"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Biology</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is part of a growing wave of research working to formally document the types of unusual changes to wildlife movements and behaviors that people around the world reported during pandemic lockdowns.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden jackals, for example, were spotted foraging in broad daylight in urban Tel Aviv, Israel, and mountain lions were seen strolling through downtown Santiago, Chile. Urban environments had suddenly become quiet and empty as shelter-in-place orders brought human movement to a grinding halt&#8212;an effect some researchers have called the &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1237-z?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100095187&amp;utm_content=deeplink"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anthropause</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; Wildlife seemed to be taking advantage. The new study shows this was certainly true for pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Researchers were able to clearly connect changes in the cats&#8217; habitat use with reduced human mobility during shelter-in-place orders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Wilmers, an environmental studies professor at UC Santa Cruz, led this research. Wilmers is the principal investigator for the </span><a href="http://www.santacruzpumas.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Puma Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he has been studying local mountain lion populations for over a decade. In particular, his research uses data from GPS tracking collars placed on wild pumas to show how fear of humans affects mountain lion behavior and ecology. When the pandemic hit, his team was already tracking data from several collared cats, and he recognized a unique research opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When the shelter-in-place orders started, it was immediately clear that things were very different,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;You&#8217;d go outside and there were very few cars. Entire neighborhoods were completely quiet. So we wondered how this might affect the mountain lion population. Would they respond this quickly to reduced human presence?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer that question, the team analyzed about two years worth of mountain lion tracking data for a set of six collared cats to see where the pumas roamed and what types of habitats they used. Researchers compared these tracks with the distribution of housing density and the geographic boundaries of the &#8220;urban edge,&#8221; which indicates where vehicle and pedestrian traffic is heightened. During regional shelter-in-place orders, they found that cats were significantly more likely to move into or closer to the urban edge. And these changes happened rapidly: within days or weeks of the beginning of COVID-19 lockdowns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to hone in on the cause of this change, the team ruled out any influence of natural factors&#8212;like topography, vegetation cover, or distance to the nearest water source&#8212;that might affect the cats&#8217; choice of habitats. They also compared year-over-year tracking data to show that seasonal variability wasn&#8217;t affecting the results. Pumas do have a strong preference for habitats with lower housing density, but this factor did not change significantly during the study period. The key difference that appeared to be driving the trend of mountain lions moving into urban areas was reduced human mobility during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After regional shelter-in-place orders went into effect on March 17, 2020, local human mobility declined more than 50 percent, according to Apple mobility data, which show the number of navigation requests for driving and walking trips received through Apple Maps. During this time period, when people confined themselves in their homes, the data showed a strong relationship between declining levels of human mobility and pumas&#8217; increased willingness to venture closer to or into urban areas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We found that they totally relaxed their fear of the urban edge,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that they weren&#8217;t scared of cities; they were still scared, but only of high housing density, not the extra impact of human mobility. If you take all the car trips and pedestrian trips and human mobility out of it, then, all of a sudden, mountain lions don&#8217;t fear the city as much.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilmers says this finding helps to build understanding of the unique impacts of human mobility on wildlife. Conservation efforts often focus on the ways that humans are destroying habitats&#8212;through development and pollution, for example&#8212;but the mere presence of people moving across a landscape also takes a toll on animals that fear humans. And this too is a conservation challenge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important because our mobility just keeps increasing,&#8221; Wilmers explained. &#8220;In the early part of the 20th century, we got cars, and that really increased our mobility. Now we have things like ride-sharing apps, mountain bikes, and electric bikes, and these are all ways that we&#8217;re becoming more and more mobile across more types of landscapes. It&#8217;s an important thing to think about as we try to conserve and manage ecosystems.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key point this research illustrates is that fear, or the removal of a source of fear, can bring about rapid changes in animal behavior that ripple out through ecosystems. Ecologists call this concept the &#8220;landscape of fear.&#8221; And the pandemic showed just how integrated into this landscape humans really are. People are usually the ones exerting the influence of fear upon other animals, but there are some things that even we fear.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Humans have always been the top dog in landscapes of fear, but this study shows that those influences of humans can be reversed relatively quickly by a pathogen, particularly a pandemic-causing pathogen,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;It&#8217;s interesting from a theoretical perspective, and it&#8217;s also important in a practical sense because it shows that, not only are pandemics going to have major health consequences for people, but there are also going to be important ecological impacts.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4079bfb58072704647a15c51af25684e"><name>whistleblower-notice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual message about the California Whistleblower Protection Act</title><summary>The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.</summary><start-date>1624518000000</start-date><display-name>Annual message about the California Whistleblower Protection Act</display-name><path>/2021/06/whistleblower-notice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/whistleblower-notice</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1624579358612</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654883900314</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/06/images/whistleblower.png</path><link>site://news/2021/06/images/whistleblower.png</link><site>news</site><name>whistleblower.png</name><display-name>whistleblower.png</display-name><file-size>148308</file-size><width>288</width><height>615</height></image><image-alt>Whistleblower brochure</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 message is <a href="images/2021-csa-brochure.pdf">available online</a>.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission.

<p>&#8220;Pride is a riot,&#8221; says Mia Boykin. &#8220;It is a political stance against the policing of Black and brown trans bodies. It&#8217;s not the superficial celebration or the corporatism you see in these businesses and cultures that look to capitalize on this movement."</p>
<p>Mia Boykin is a doctoral student working toward obtaining a Creative/Critical Ph.D. in Literature at UC Santa Cruz. Boykin, who is also known by her nom de plume Mimi Tempestt, is a multi-media artist and poet, who created an archival interview series called Black.Queer.Alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The project started as an oral history that focused on interviewing as many of the Black and queer people across the diaspora as possible,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The next phase of her endeavor will intersect with a summer fellowship at the TG/ENBY Project in Los Angeles to create <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blackqueeralive-summer-2021-community-workshops-tickets-155739642463">Black.Queer.Alive. Summer 2021 Community Workshops</a>, which will be on the last Sunday of each of the summer months beginning in June and running through September. Due to COVID&#8211;19 considerations, the workshops will be held remotely via Zoom.</p>
<p>TG/ENBY is a trans fitness initiative aimed at making exercise more accessible to nonbinary people, and while one of the workshops Boykin will host focuses exclusively on fitness for queer individuals, she is also expanding the offerings to include subjects like creativity, politics and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a series that seeks to break negative patterns embedded in the narrative that typically gets told about Black and queer people,&#8221; Boykin says.</p>
<p>The first two-hour workshop begins at 1 p.m PST on June 27 and will be led by Madison McCartha, Boykin&#8217;s fellow student at the Creative/Critical PhD. program at UC Santa Cruz and whose work as a poet, critic and visual artist has received widespread acclaim.</p>
<p>McCartha&#8217;s workshop is called &#8220;Breaking the Aperture&#8221; and will focus on the overarching features Black and queer experience.</p>
<p>The second workshop, in July, will feature Olka Beldah, who is slated to lead a program called &#8220;Yoga for the Queer Expanse.&#8221; Beldah, a prolific poet, podcaster and activist, has long incorporated concepts of yoga into a space that explores the lingering health effects on Black Americans victimized by police brutality and other effects of systemic racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The workshop will discuss healing through breathing techniques and tantric exercises as well as other ways to focus on our bodies,&#8221; Boykin says.</p>
<p>The July workshop is the most explicit example of Boykin&#8217;s work dovetailing with that of TG/ENBY, but August&#8217;s speaker, Raihana Haynes-Venerable, will also provide a relevant disquisition on the intersection of queerness and Blackness. Haynes-Venerable is also a poet and doubles as a photographer and speaker on the queer Black experience and how it interacts with institutions around the subjects of patriotism and race.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about politicizing and radicalizing our ideas in different ways,&#8221; Boykin says.</p>
<p>The final workshop is slated to be held online at 1 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, Sept. 26 and will feature Marcel Hill. Hill advocates for entrepreneurial approaches to self-empowerment and will discuss how he constructed his business called Phew!Beauty &#8211; a handcrafted natural skincare brand based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Boykin says it will be important for younger people to hear how Hill transformed his passion into a viable business that affords him the independence and assurance to be an effective advocate for a gamut of issues pertinent to the Black experience in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate to be in community with these amazing people who bring all these talents and perspectives, are Black and queer and ready to share their knowledge,&#8221; Boykin says.</p>
<p>She says the workshops will be focused on Black and queer experiences, but are also open to anyone who would like to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about creating space for people who aren&#8217;t seen, for people who may not have access to the resources, information, knowledge and experience,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It could be the community college kid or really just anyone who isn&#8217;t sure what their politic is. If you are curious about what it means to be Black and queer, come to the workshop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boykin has been wrestling with these questions since growing up in Los Angeles. She considers herself a daughter of California but quickly glommed on to the underground currents that facilitated an intellectual fermentation around the issues she found herself concerned with in her youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I encountered these concepts in the underground,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The academy just provided a language for what I already saw happening all around.&#8221;</p>
<p>After graduating high school, Boykin attended Mills College, the liberal arts college in Oakland, where she earned a Master of Arts in literature. She continues to reside in Oakland, where she weathered the pandemic with other members of her community.</p>
<p>Her debut collection of poems, <em>The Monument of Misremeberings</em>, was published in 2020 with Co-Conspirator Press and it follows her debut album, called <em>Rough Diamond</em>, which was released in 2019. Boykin hopes that her workshop can serve as a catalyst for other similarly situated people looking to jumpstart their careers, explore questions surrounding their own or others&#8217; identity or contextualize their experience.</p>

Maya K. Peterson, associate professor of history known by so many in our campus community, died in childbirth on June 16. Her daughter with partner A. Marm Kilpatrick, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, also passed away. Her name was Priya Luna.</p>
<p>This is a profound loss, and our thoughts and condolences are with Marm, Maya&#8217;s family, and with her friends and colleagues. Maya was an internationally known scholar and an immensely talented historian and teacher, and more than that, she was a vibrant presence in our community &#8211; deeply involved in a host of campus initiatives, passionate and funny, inspiring and kind. Her sudden and unthinkable loss after nearly a decade in our midst leaves an emptiness that is hard to process.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone struggling with this news to reach out to campus grief and crisis counselors.

<p>A memorial service for the campus community is still being planned, and will likely occur this fall. The event details will be shared widely once finalized. The Humanities Division has established the Maya K. Peterson Memorial Fund to honor Maya&#8217;s memory and legacy. The specific use of the fund is still being decided by family members. Contributions can be made to the fund at the university&#8217;s <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid%3D1069%26gid%3D1001%26pgid%3D780%26cid%3D1749%26dids%3D1087%26bledit%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624739506850000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXfiYWN_vSvBg6OZ8A_QTxMVlnsw" href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=1087&amp;bledit=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Online Giving Site</a>.

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Face coverings</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Face coverings will be required indoors for people who are not fully vaccinated. The campus will provide face coverings and N95 respirators for any unvaccinated employees who would like one. You can request face coverings or N95 respirators through the campus </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZWheLtmc7GOAeEz4qh8Dl_mT9v6FaJlYNOSzQdCEJAJe1WQ/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624741743687000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZOHnRrKs4BjhIFKyWrDeNAY60vg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZWheLtmc7GOAeEz4qh8Dl_mT9v6FaJlYNOSzQdCEJAJe1WQ/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>COVID-19 supplies request form</span></a><span> or contact EH&amp;S at </span><a href="mailto:ehs@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ehs@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> for assistance. We recognize that some vaccinated people might still prefer to wear face coverings, and managers should ensure those individuals&#8217; choices are supported. We anticipate that UCOP will provide additional guidance on face coverings as we plan for the fall quarter.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Face coverings are required for everyone riding a campus shuttle/bus.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Physical distancing and partitions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Physical distancing is no longer required, except for unvaccinated employees eating or drinking indoors. Plastic partitions are no longer required where physical distancing is not possible, although it is not required to remove partitions that have already been put in place.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Symptom checks</span></h3>

This means buildings and programs are no longer required to submit plans before spaces can be utilized or programs can resume onsite. All existing COVID-19 building signage can be removed, restrooms can be opened up without restrictions, and spaces, including conference rooms, will not have COVID-19 capacity related restrictions. We will keep hand sanitizer stations at the main entrances. We are in the process of developing a new universal building sign outlining the updated COVID-19 protocols.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Employee isolation spaces</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All employee isolation spaces in buildings can return to their intended use, with the understanding that those spaces will need to be cleared if required for a COVID case.&#160;</span></p>

We anticipate the&#160; policy will be finalized by the Office of the President by July 15. Our campus is finalizing the tool we will use to upload proof of vaccination. In addition, a systemwide work group has been appointed to make recommendations about other aspects of policy implementation. As more information becomes available, we will update you.</span></p>

As this spacecraft orbits Mars, it continues to provide important data on the Red Planet&#8217;s interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere, and environment.&#160;</p>
<p>Onboard this spacecraft is an instrument called the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, or MARSIS for short. This instrument uses a radar sounder to assess the composition of the subsurface of Mars.</p>
<p>Scientists studying Mars, using the MARSIS instrument data, have previously reported a regionally strong radar reflection under Mars&#8217; south polar ice sheet and have interpreted these bright radar reflections at the base of the south polar ice cap as being caused by liquid water.&#160;</p>
<p>But a team of scientists, including researchers with UC Santa Cruz and Arizona State University, using data from this same instrument, have determined that Mars&#8217; south polar ice sheet may be made of clays, metal-bearing minerals, or saline ice. Their findings have been <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL093880">recently published</a> in AGU&#8217;s Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our fresh look at the radar reflections from the bottom of the ice cap on Mars builds on my recent Antarctic research into electrical conductivity of sub-ice materials there. It is a great example of how understanding of polar regions on Earth informs our interpretations of cold environments on other planetary bodies,&#8221; said Professor Slawek Tulaczyk.</p>
<p>A radar reflection can be bright due to a large contrast in either dielectric permittivity (how a material responds to an electric field) or electric conductivity (the amount of electrical current a material can carry). While previous studies only considered contrasts in dielectric permittivity, Bierson and his team found that contrasts in electric conductivity between materials could also explain the brightness of the reflection.&#160;</p>
<p>Using Earth as an example, under the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, many materials have high electric conductivity, including very salty water (brines), salty ice deposits, and clays.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to check if this same wide range of materials might be able to explain the bright radar reflection under Mars' south polar cap,&#8221; said planetary scientist Carver Bierson, with ASU&#8217;s School of Earth and Space Exploration.</p>
<p>Bierson led the study and co-authored the paper with Tulaczyk, graduate student Sam Courville of ASU, who conducted orbital radar modeling; and Mars radar measurements expert Nathaniel Putzig of the Planetary Science Institute.&#160;</p>
<p>Together, they were able to determine what level of electric conductivity the material below the ice would need to have to match the observed signal from MARSIS. Then, they identified materials that are both conductive and present on Mars including clays, metal-bearing minerals, and saline ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salty ice or conductive minerals at the base of the ice sheet are less flashy, but are more in line with the extremely cold temperatures at Mars poles,&#8221; said Bierson.</p>
<p>While not explicitly excluding a liquid brine, the results open new potential explanations for the observed strong radar reflections, some of which do not require liquid brine beneath the Martian south polar ice cap.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results are a reminder that there is often more than one way to explain an observation,&#8221; said Bierson.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7ca5d9988072704647a15c51cea541be"><name>brandt-returning-to-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt returning to the faculty</title><summary>We write to share news that Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt has announced he will return to the faculty, effective July 16.</summary><start-date>1625036400000</start-date><display-name>Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt returning to the faculty</display-name><path>/2021/06/brandt-returning-to-faculty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/brandt-returning-to-faculty</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1625588881798</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1625588901829</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We write to share news that Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt has announced he will return to the faculty, effective July 16.</p>
<p>Scott, a professor of computer science and engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering and the Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software, has led our Office of Research since 2013. The office helps power our entire research enterprise, and Scott has helped lead UCSC to new heights in research.</p>
<p>He led the development of our Silicon Valley Campus and helped steer our research operation through two unprecedented and overlapping crises &#8211; the COVID-19 pandemic and the CZU Lightning Complex wildfires, which spurred the first-ever emergency evacuation of our campus. He was instrumental in the creation of our Colligan Clinical Diagnostics Lab and helped foster our collaboration with the county to provide COVID-19 testing to community partners.</p>
<p>In his eight years as vice chancellor, Scott worked to transform the Office of Research into a proactive research-support unit. He created the Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization unit to support campus business engagement, innovation and entrepreneurship efforts, pushing research patent and licensing activity to all-time highs and creating new paths for campus innovators and entrepreneurs looking to bring their products into the marketplace. It also laid the foundation for our recently established IBE Hub.</p>
<p>His creation of a Research Development unit to support faculty in their efforts to secure research funding coupled with new seed-funding initiatives helped grow our campus contracts and grants by more than 50 percent over the past three years.</p>
<p>We are deeply appreciative of Scott&#8217;s leadership in support of our research enterprise and wish him well as he returns to the faculty.</p>
<p>We are pleased to share that John MacMillan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Development, has agreed to serve as the interim Vice Chancellor for Research, and we look forward to working with John to support research on our campus. The details and timeline for the recruitment of a permanent replacement are still being finalized.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy and Lori</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Cynthia Larive, Chancellor; Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77dbfc38807270172c1b96bd7dc3076b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>June</title><start-date>1622530800000</start-date><display-name>June</display-name><path>/2021/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/06/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1608328674346</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609787726339</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
