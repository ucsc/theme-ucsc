She was 95.</p>
<p>A professor emerita of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Langenheim conducted field research on five continents, crossed the disciplinary boundaries of botany, geology, and chemistry, served as president of four different scientific societies, and broke new ground for women in science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean was a remarkable person who forged new pathways in her personal scientific research, overcame the many barriers to women scientists as she built her scientific program, contributed to the establishment and furthering of entire scientific disciplines, and mentored generations of students,&#8221; said John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a lion in her field,&#8221; added Ingrid Parker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. &#8220;She was such a trailblazer herself, yet she was always thinking about how to promote the next generation and create opportunities for young scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langenheim studied plant resins and amber (fossilized resin) for more than 40 years, and her 2003 book <em>Plant Resins</em> is the authoritative reference book on the subject. Her investigations covered every aspect of plant resins, including their chemistry, their roles in the ecology of the plants that produce them, the evolutionary history of resin-producing plants, and the many uses of resins throughout human history.</p>
<p>She conducted the first chemical analyses to determine the biological sources of amber, and her 1969 paper in the journal <em>Science</em> became a classic, establishing her as the world's leading authority on the botanical origins of amber. Her interdisciplinary research on the ways in which plants use chemicals to defend themselves from pathogens and herbivores helped establish the field of chemical ecology.</p>
<p>&#8220;She transformed chemical ecology with her pioneering research,&#8221; Parker said.</p>
<p>Langenheim began her career at a time when professional opportunities for women in science were limited. At UC Santa Cruz, she was the campus's first female faculty member in the natural sciences and the first woman to be promoted to full professor. She later became the first woman to serve as president of the Association for Tropical Biology and the International Society of Chemical Ecology, as well as the second woman president of the Ecological Society of America and the Society of Economic Botany.</p>
<p>In her memoir, <em>The Odyssey of a Woman Field Scientist</em>, Langenheim wrote, &#8220;I lived through the period of being the token woman in numerous situations; I was not an activist fighting on the front lines, so to speak, but tried to demonstrate the capability of women through my own hard work and accomplishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langenheim was born in 1925 in Homer, Louisiana, to Jeanette Smith and Vergil Wilson Harmon. In the early 1930s, the family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she graduated from high school in 1943 and from the University of Tulsa in 1946 with a B.S. in biology. In 1946, she married Ralph Langenheim, a geology student, and they did their doctoral research together at the University of Minnesota, where she studied with the ecologist William S. Cooper. She earned her M.S. in 1949 and Ph.D. in 1953, both in botany.</p>
<p>When her husband joined the faculty at UC Berkeley, Langenheim took a research associate position in the botany department. She was also an assistant professor at San Francisco College for Women and taught field ecology and botany at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado. She and her husband moved to the University of Illinois in 1959, where she continued her studies in ecology and paleobotany as a research associate.</p>
<p>After a divorce in 1962, Langenheim became a scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Studies (now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study) and a research fellow in biology at Harvard University. At Harvard, she began exploring the chemical analysis of amber samples she had collected in Chiapas, Mexico, on an expedition she and her husband had participated in while still at the University of Illinois. Her discovery that the amber came from a tropical flowering tree upended the common assumption that all amber was produced from pines.</p>
<p>Langenheim came to UC Santa Cruz in 1966, the campus&#8217;s second year, as an assistant professor of biology. She worked closely with the plant physiologist Kenneth Thimann, helping to establish a strong program in plant sciences at UCSC. Over the years, Langenheim and Thimann taught thousands of undergraduates in their popular botany course, &#8220;Plants and Human Affairs,&#8221; and they coauthored a textbook for the course.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an intriguing move from [Harvard] the oldest university, full of rich tradition, to a new campus bursting with innovation,&#8221; she wrote in her memoir.</p>
<p>Langenheim played an important role in the establishment of the graduate studies program at UC Santa Cruz. She sponsored or cosponsored more than 40 graduate students, including students from Brazil and Mexico, and her lab included postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty from Korea, China, and New Zealand. She did field research around the world, through much of Mexico and Central and South America, as well as Europe, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>While Langenheim&#8217;s research focused on the evolution and ecology of tropical trees, her students also studied the chemical ecology of redwoods and other plants native to the California coast. Many of her former graduate students stayed in close contact with her through the years, and she considered them her &#8220;surrogate family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langenheim served on a variety of advisory boards for UC and for national and international organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the International Union of Biological Sciences. A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Ecological Society of America, and the California Academy of Sciences, she received the California Academy&#8217;s highest honor, the Fellows Medal, in 2006.</p>
<p>Although she officially retired in 1994, Langenheim remained active as a professor emerita, supervising graduate students and publishing several major syntheses of research on amber and chemical ecology.</p>
<p>Langenheim provided generous philanthropic support for research on the ecology and evolution of plants. She endowed graduate fellowships in plant ecology and evolution at UC Santa Cruz and at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, as well as a graduate fellowship in the field sciences for Sigma Delta Epsilon/Graduate Women in Science. She also endowed a faculty chair at UCSC, the Jean H. Langenheim Endowed Chair in Plant Ecology and Evolution. In support of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, she endowed a program to foster and strengthen ties between the Arboretum and plant science faculty and students for research and teaching.</p>
<p>Langenheim also loved animals and established a program at the Santa Cruz SPCA, known as &#8220;Blackie&#8217;s Senior Friends,&#8221; to match older animals with senior citizens. She requested that donations in her memory be made to the <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=312">Jean H. Langenheim Endowed Graduate Fellowship</a> fund at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

All incoming slugs are invited to join <a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/summer-edge/index.html">Summer Edge</a>, an early start program designed to jumpstart their academic careers by taking courses remotely before their first fall. Edge students can fulfill prerequisites, degree requirements, or jump into major coursework. They also receive an exclusive 25% discount on per-credit summer tuition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting early can open up time in an academic plan for an internship, research with faculty, study abroad, or even graduating early. Financial Aid is available for eligible students taking a minimum of seven credits. There are additional savings for out-of-state students who pay the same tuition rate as California residents over the summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 908 Edge students completed 7,867 credits, said Summer Session Director Monica Parikh.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We develop the recommended course lists with academic advisors so our students have clear guidance on what to take,&#8221; Parikh said. &#8220;And with $4,000-$5,000 in grant aid for each eligible student, UCSC is making this early start doable for new Slugs around the world.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to earning credits, students receive support from staff and peer mentors through workshops and one-on-one sessions. There is also a diverse set of virtual social events where they can make friends before the school year begins!&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8e60ebd380727017480ce726420635a6"><name>zavaleta-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Erika Zavaleta honored for diversity efforts by Ecological Society of America</title><summary>The Ecological Society of America (ESA) has chosen Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, to receive its 2021 Commitment to Human Diversity in Ecology Award.</summary><start-date>1617724800000</start-date><display-name>Erika Zavaleta honored for diversity efforts by Ecological Society of America</display-name><path>/2021/04/zavaleta-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/zavaleta-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1617296419764</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617734139765</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</name><display-name>erika-zavaleta-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>76578</file-size><width>350</width><height>388</height></image><image-alt>Erika Zavaleta</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>erika-zavaleta-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23592</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Erika Zavaleta</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Erika Zavaleta (photo by Matt Kroll)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Ecological Society of America (ESA) has chosen Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, to receive its 2021 Commitment to Human Diversity in Ecology Award.</p>
<p>The award recognizes long-standing contributions toward increasing the diversity of future ecologists through mentoring, teaching, or outreach.</p>
<p>The ESA&#8217;s announcement of the award noted that &#8220;Zavaleta&#8217;s development of innovative and accessible field experiences has enhanced the science skills, confidence, and leadership potential of many underrepresented students in conservation science, who are now pursuing or fulfilling their goals of an environmental career and sharing her vision to diversify today&#8217;s environmental workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavaleta has launched and directed three diversity in ecology programs at UCSC in the last five years, and these programs have impacted several hundred students by mentoring them through their career pathways.</p>
<p>Since 2015, she has directed the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a>, which recruits a diverse cohort of students each year for experiential training in field research and conservation leadership. As a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, Zavaleta launched the <a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/">Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-Based Opportunities (CAMINO)</a> for students in ecology and conservation programs and developed a training program for preventing sexual harassment in field biology activities. Student testimonials attest to the success of her programs and her ability to share her commitment to human diversity in ecology.</p>
<p>Zavaleta&#8217;s science communication skills have also been impactful, as seen in her 29 short field-based films about California&#8217;s ecology and conservation and in her award-winning book, <em>Ecosystems of California</em>, co-edited with Hal Mooney.</p>
<p>Her scholarship has also focused on developing inclusive field experiences for students from diverse backgrounds and on elevating the human dimension in her research on climate change impacts on ecosystem function and services. A fellow of the Ecological Society of America and the California Academy of Sciences, Zavaleta has received several awards for her innovative work, including the 2006 ESA Sustainability Science Award. She was named a HHMI professor in 2018.</p>
<p>ESA will present the 2021 awards during a ceremony at the Society&#8217;s upcoming Virtual Annual Meeting, which will take place in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year&#8217;s award recipients have shown remarkable leadership and creativity,&#8221; said ESA President Kathleen Weathers. &#8220;On behalf of the Ecological Society of America, I congratulate the award winners and thank them for their significant contributions to building both ecological knowledge and the community of ecologists.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9056cdda80727017480ce7260bc21eb8"><name>chancellor-update-fall-spring</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planning for fall and staying connected through the spring </title><summary>With spring in full bloom, I write with updates on what to expect this quarter for instruction and in campus housing, to make sure you're all aware of our still evolving plans for fall, and to highlight some of the creative ways that Banana Slugs are staying connected while we are still spread geographically far and wide.</summary><start-date>1617260400000</start-date><display-name>Planning for fall and staying connected through the spring </display-name><path>/2021/04/chancellor-update-fall-spring</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/chancellor-update-fall-spring</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1617329311141</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662576668564</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It's wonderful what a few beautiful days can do for the human spirit.

<h2>New resources open on campus</h2>
<p>As COVID-19 restrictions are eased, more campus resources are being offered in person. Don't forget that <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413720000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuYc-fAGi2I-odm_p7DpMgtAWLBQ" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">green badges</a> are required for students to access these in-person resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pool is open to students for lap swimming and the East Tennis Courts are available for tennis on a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification%3D26e7654b-b3c6-45de-ac5e-967a7ade45c3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5ijfyWf89OIBK3YTU8ZDRRy7Dbw" href="https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification=26e7654b-b3c6-45de-ac5e-967a7ade45c3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reservation system</a>.</li>
<li>The outdoor jogging path around the Upper East Field, the Disc Golf Course, and the West Tennis Courts are currently available for drop-in use.</li>
<li>Additional study spaces are already open on campus to support students. Reserve your spot in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/studycenter&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1Uk5PUkTvytdmDS8SI6mmvfkUaA" href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/studycenter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Science and Engineering Library</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Spring forward</h2>
<p>We have increased the availability of on-campus student housing to more than 1,500 beds, so expect to see more students on campus this quarter. All students living on campus are still required to participate in twice-weekly asymptomatic testing, wear face coverings, and practice distancing. You'll also see more in-person learning this spring, with an increase from five to 19 in-person courses.</p>
<h2>Santa Cruz County moves to orange tier</h2>
<p>These developments follow good news on the COVID-19 front, locally. Our campus positive rates have been lower than county and state rates from the start of the pandemic. The numbers in the greater Santa Cruz County community have now fallen low enough that, starting today, April 1, the county is moving to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQBzIhEgBdIGsbvVsu3QKZ656k3w" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the state's orange tier of COVID restrictions</a>. (A sure sign that things are improving is the news that the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk's Giant Dipper is reopening today!) Public health officials say we should continue to minimize social mixing from different households and avoid crowds, but the orange tier does allow for the easing of restrictions on restaurants, retail stores and other businesses and enterprises. The least restrictive yellow tier is the final stop before all restrictions are lifted.</p>
<h2>Focus on fall</h2>
<p>Since the announcement earlier this year that campuses throughout the UC system will offer primarily in-person instruction this fall, our Recovery Teams have been hard at work planning the return to in-person instruction. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/fall-quarter-planning.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhpLK_GfjmdO1bMnuDTt1EmaXlTA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/fall-quarter-planning.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As we announced last week</a>, we are aiming for two-thirds to three-quarters of classes to be conducted in-person. Classes with enrollments of 150 or more students will remain remote or online. All of our fall plans are subject to change based on state and county guidelines as well as the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Importantly, there will be pathways to support progress toward degrees for students who need to continue learning remotely. <strong>We expect to publish the fall-quarter course schedule by May 10</strong> that specifies which courses will be in-person and which will be offered remotely or online so that students have time to plan accordingly, including making housing decisions.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 vaccinations</h2>
<p>Our plans also assume that by the start of the fall quarter, there will be widespread availability of vaccines and very few new daily cases within our campus community. I encourage you all to get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/25/state-expands-vaccine-eligibility-to-50-californians-starting-april-1-and-all-individuals-16-on-april-15-based-on-expected-supply-increases/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWYW6qZX9-85Mb5-YFs8NBFXwb5g" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/25/state-expands-vaccine-eligibility-to-50-californians-starting-april-1-and-all-individuals-16-on-april-15-based-on-expected-supply-increases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Governor Newsom has announced that all Californians 16 and older will be eligible beginning April 15</a>!</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz does not currently expect to receive additional doses of the vaccine and so the best way to ensure you're in line for a vaccine is to sign up at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwhaUR1ZvwRpwo_G-a3qAB3s01ag" href="https://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MyTurn.ca.gov</a>. MyTurn will tell you your eligibility by county and alert you when you can schedule a vaccination appointment. And remember, if you work at UC Santa Cruz, you should select "Educator" or "School Employee" as the "business or industry" where you work.</p>
<h2>Graduating students register for commencement</h2>
<p>As a reminder, graduating students must register between Monday, April 26, and Wednesday, May 19, to participate in virtual commencement. Visit our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkGoGK7YqysSMkDb2lV2D93g5mHg" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a> for more details. We are also once again sending gift boxes to help students and their families mark the occasion. The deadline to register for a gift box is even sooner &#8212; April 15 &#8212; so take a moment and register now! The link to do so is on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkGoGK7YqysSMkDb2lV2D93g5mHg" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a>. Students who don't plan to participate in virtual commencement are still able to register for a gift box.</p>
<h2>No matter where you are ...</h2>
<p>On campus or not, you can still access <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGE8Fqcdign1E1KqOwcJAyMINDAmg" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus resources, engage with other students, and stay connected</a>.</p>

<li>For those students moving onto campus this quarter, be sure to check out the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dining.ucsc.edu/get/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFf9pVt3pX62srhfEE6H3tiXUVCbg" href="https://dining.ucsc.edu/get/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GET app and website</a>. Due to COVID-19 operational changes, all dining hall meals must be ordered ahead using the app or website. It's a touchless payment and ordering option that promotes a clean dining environment, plus all you need to have with you is your phone. You can also purchase Flexi Dollars, Slug Meals, even coffee and groceries at The Market. Once we're able to resume dine-in service, you'll be able to "swipe in" to the dining halls using the app as well. Staff and faculty can use the GET app too!</li>
<li>UCSC students have launched a daily podcast called the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/slugcast/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617404413721000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3ma1tP0tSQvRdUm1qPKPRO9tcPA" href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/slugcast/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SlugCast</a> that features student voices telling the stories students want to hear. I recommend the Campus History episode in particular for a focus on the American Indian Resource Center and the people who stewarded this land long before it was our campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am extremely proud of the extraordinary work so many on our campus have done over the past year supporting student, staff and faculty well-being in the face of so much uncertainty. Your commitment to each other is heartening &#8212; and what is allowing us to move forward in the ways outlined above. I am excited for spring and summer, and eager for us to be able to gather again.</p>

href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</a>'s Valuing Open and Inclusive Conversation and Engagement (VOICE) Grant Program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>VOICE provides funding for UC students, staff, and faculty who are interested in conducting research or coordinating programs and activities that further the mission of the Center.</span></p>
<p><span>The Washington, D.C.-based&#160;UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement&#160;explores how the fundamental democratic and academic principles of free speech and civic engagement should enrich the discovery and transmission of knowledge in America&#8217;s colleges and universities. Through research, advocacy, debate, and discussion, the Center is dedicated to ensuring that the next generation of leaders is prepared to understand, defend, and advance these values.</span></p>
<p><span>This year, the Center&#8217;s VOICE Initiative focuses on the theme of &#8220;Breaking Barriers&#8221; in campus expression and engagement. The VOICE-funded programs, activities, and research identify barriers, the steps that can be taken to address those barriers, and how those steps help to build community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The three UCSC projects include <i>Art, Prisons, and the University: Creating a Culture of Inclusivity for Formerly Incarcerated Students, </i>led by<i> </i>Rachel Nelson, director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with Louise Leong at the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery. The project is designed to promote and bring visibility to the work of the Underground Scholars (US), a University of California-wide initiative aimed at supporting formerly incarcerated students and other system impacted students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><i>Practicing Accessibility and Inclusion </i>is a project </span><span>l</span><span>ed by Andrea Cohen, Special Assistant to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, and Carmen Robinson, director of Student Excellence, Engagement, and Inclusion for Baskin Engineering. This project will increase understanding and focus on accessible programs within the School of Engineering through a faculty and staff dialogue series on universal design, design thinking, understanding neurodiversity, student accommodations, inclusive language, and perspectives of accessibility from people with disabilities. The series will facilitate conversation and share with faculty and staff practical innovative tools and solutions for immediate implementation.</span></p>
<p><span>The third project is <i>We Belong: Transformative Literacies for Civic Engagement,</i> led by Sheeva Sabati, director and community liaison for the Oakes Community-based Action Research and Advocacy (CARA) Program. The award will support a collaboration between We Belong&#8212;a Community Initiated Student Engaged Research (CISER) project that aims to understand how documentation status impacts immigrant families' abilities to access services, create community, and thrive&#8212;and Oakes College's Community-based Action Research and Advocacy (CARA) program.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="948c3ba080727017480ce726199efbb4"><name>case-for-reparations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Event to focus on the case for Black reparations</title><summary>“Reparations for Black Americans: The Road to Racial Equality in California and Beyond,” hosted on April 15 by the Institute for Social Transformation, will feature a discussion with leading experts and advocates of reparations.</summary><start-date>1617346800000</start-date><display-name>The case for Black reparations focus of April 15 Event</display-name><path>/2021/04/case-for-reparations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/case-for-reparations</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1617399921528</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617404810295</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elisa Smith</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/memorial-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/memorial-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>memorial-500px.jpg</name><display-name>memorial-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>195131</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/memorial-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/memorial-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>memorial-80px.jpg</name><display-name>memorial-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>13109</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The Memorial Corridor at the <a href="https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial">National Memorial for Peace and Justice</a>, which&#160;is the nation&#8217;s first memorial "dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence."

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The April 15 discussion will convene leading experts and advocates of reparations, including William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen, co-authors of</span> <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469654973/from-here-to-equality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Anne Price, President of the Insight Center for Community Economic Development; and Congresswoman Barbara Lee, U.S. Representative for California&#8217;s 13th congressional district. The event is moderated by Chris Benner,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of the Institute for Social Transformation at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the movement for reparations extends back to the 18th century, it has gained momentum in recent years, especially after the national protests against racial injustice last summer. U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) first introduced legislation to create a national task force to study reparations in 1989. The current version of the federal bill, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/40?r=6&amp;s=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 40</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has at least 169 co-sponsors in the House but has yet to achieve majority support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one alive today is directly responsible for the slavery of the past, but our economic system is rooted in slavery. We won&#8217;t be able to fully address racial inequality in our society until we come to terms with that,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about money. It&#8217;s about being honest with ourselves so that we can come to a full understanding about race and economic opportunity in our society.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Benner, there are three steps to consider as part of the reparations process: the first two, acknowledging harm and making reparations, then provide the basis for moving forward beyond the harm done.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;White Americans must come to terms with that history, that slavery was fundamental to our entire country, not just in the South, and that its legacy persists to this day. It means giving up an illusion, and recognizing that this country was founded on a system of white supremacy and inhumanity and that this continues to undermine the ideals of liberty, equality, and democracy that we also espouse.&#8221;&#160; Benner said. &#8220;The increased public interest and discussions about reparations in recent years is encouraging and a sign of progress. We hope that many will join us to discuss how the movement for reparations could help close the racial wealth gap and promote racial equality.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the movement for state and national reparations for Black Americans, the event will discuss how reparations can help close the racial wealth gap and promote racial equality. Speakers Sandy Darity and Kirsten Mullen have done research on the aftermath of slavery when a promise made to provide former slaves with 40 acres in land grants went unmet. Darity and Mullen estimate that it will require $10-$12 trillion in federal expenditures to bring Black Americans&#8217; economic assets up to their white counterparts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racial wealth inequity, which has been highlighted during the pandemic, has also been on speaker Anne Price&#8217;s mind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;re really seeing during the pandemic are inequities being laid bare that have existed for a long time,&#8221; said Price during a recent KSQD radio interview with Benner. &#8220;For many years, systems that really were not working on behalf of people of color, from our educational system to our healthcare system, to even our unemployment system, all have come home to roost. We&#8217;re seeing these inequities play out across these systems, and they&#8217;re interconnected. So it&#8217;s really magnifying the long-standing inequities that have been baked into these systems that are having devastating effects on people of color.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free online event is being co-sponsored by the </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">an intellectual hub at UC Santa Cruz that connects scholars, builds community collaborations, and hosts discussions about bold and innovative solutions to urgent social and environmental problems.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Please be aware that spring is the prime birthing season for a wide variety of campus wildlife, including deer.</p>
<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong> or <strong>county </strong><strong>Animal Control: <span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">831-454-7227</span>. <br/> </strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is launching a new support center to advance innovation, entrepreneurship and business engagement that will leverage the campus&#8217;s innovative spirit and be guided by its deep commitment to environmental and social justice. Its creation will help support the campus community in bringing to market cutting-edge research and ideas from faculty, students and innovators, expanding corporate philanthropy and partnerships, creating more career pathways for students, and supporting a thriving regional economy.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu">Innovation and Business Engagement Hub</a> (The Hub) is designed to facilitate and strengthen connections between students, faculty, staff, alumni, industry leaders and investors, and the community.&#160;The Hub will serve as the nexus for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s innovation community, the business community, our innovation partners, and investors.</p>
<p>The Hub will be a central support center for campus community members seeking guidance and assistance in industry partnership development, technology transfer and licensing. The Hub will also serve as a single point of entry for current and prospective industry partners and investors seeking to work with the campus. The Hub will foster and facilitate relationships around university innovation and IP for the benefit for the university, our partners, and the region.</p>
<p>"Every day UC Santa Cruz researchers are pursuing answers to society&#8217;s most pressing challenges," Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. "We can help ensure this work creates a real, transformative impact by connecting the research and ideas of our faculty, students and researchers with industry, donors, investors and other organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus has begun a national recruitment for an <a href="https://careerspub.universityofcalifornia.edu/psp/ucsc/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_APP_SCHJOB.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST&amp;Action=U&amp;FOCUS=Applicant&amp;SiteId=11&amp;JobOpeningId=16759&amp;PostingSeq=1">assistant vice chancellor for innovation and business engagement</a> to lead the Hub. UC Santa Cruz is seeking a collaborative leader to create a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem that will position the campus and the region for growth and long-term success by working in partnership with the faculty director of Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED) as well as other campus center and program directors.</p>
<p>As part of this broader, coordinated effort Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer announced today that Marco Rolandi, professor and department chair of electrical and computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, has been appointed the new faculty director for CIED effective July 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Rolandi&#8217;s research focuses on biological and bioinspired materials and their use in bioelectronic devices, which integrate electronics with biological systems. He cofounded <a href="https://cruzfoam.com/">Cruz Foam</a>, which makes environmentally friendly foam products using chitin, a material derived from shrimp shell waste. Rolandi is also the scientific founder of KitoTech Medical, a Seattle-based medical device company launched in 2012 to develop a wound closure device.</p>
<p>The first work of the Hub will be to identify new opportunities for connecting potential industry partners with UC Santa Cruz and build partnerships with faculty to help advance their work.<img alt="" height="290" src="images/the-hub-lab-500px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 7px;" width="400"/></p>
<p>Kletzer said the Hub will be supported by an internal advisory group that includes the deans, the faculty director of the CIED, entrepreneurs-in-residence, and other key campus leaders; as well as an external advisory group that will guide its work with industry and investors.</p>
<p>"The Hub is about creating opportunities for our innovators and entrepreneurs&#8212; students, faculty and researchers&#8212;to work more effectively with businesses and nonprofits,&#8221; Kletzer said.</p>
<p>The Hub brings to fruition a number of recommendations that have been made through campuswide conversations about entrepreneurship and industry partnerships including the 2019 Task Force on Entrepreneurship and the UCSC Foundation&#8217;s Task Force for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The Hub also represents a creative approach by campus units to pool staff resources and expertise to create a unified effort to advance the work of the university. While units across the university will be connected to the Hub, early collaborators include the Office of Research, University Relations, the Division of Student Affairs and Success, and the UCSC Silicon Valley Extension's Career Services office.</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt said the research enterprise at UC Santa Cruz has never been stronger, setting the stage for the Hub to accelerate current work in business development, industry alliances, technology transfer, innovation, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>"Our faculty are driven to push the boundary of what&#8217;s possible&#8212;whether advancing computer chip architecture or developing novel compounds with potential medicinal uses," said Brandt, who oversees the Office of Research. &#8220;This initiative will enable more collaborations, open up new lines of inquiry, and ultimately advance our overall mission as a university.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 2019-2020 fiscal year, UC Santa Cruz researchers secured $189.8 million in funding, an all-time high that is 14 percent above the previous year. Faculty, staff and students were awarded 20 U.S. and 22 foreign patents, bringing the campus total to 153 U.S. and 169 foreign patents, and filed 101 U.S. and foreign patent applications, also an all-time record. UC Santa Cruz signed more than two dozen license and option agreements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The combined effort to build an innovation and entrepreneurial network that includes our alumni, donors and friends of the university will allow us to do so much more than what we could do as one division alone,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis. &#8220;The Hub presents a real opportunity to strengthen the network and grow the campus&#8217;s base of supporters.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a7ee42bd80727017480ce726f2747519"><name>cied-faculty-director-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marco Rolandi appointed faculty director of UCSC Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has appointed Marco Rolandi, professor and chair of the department of electrical and computer engineering, to serve as faculty director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED).</summary><start-date>1617746400000</start-date><display-name>Faculty director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</display-name><path>/2021/04/cied-faculty-director-announcement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/cied-faculty-director-announcement</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1617725112988</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617816039670</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/rolandi-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/rolandi-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rolandi-400px.jpg</name><display-name>rolandi-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>326922</file-size><width>400</width><height>545</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/marco-rolandi-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/marco-rolandi-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marco-rolandi-80px.jpg</name><display-name>marco-rolandi-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15003</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Marco&#160;Rolandi&#8217;s research focuses on biological and bioinspired materials and their use in bioelectronic devices, which integrate electronics with biological systems. (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has appointed Marco Rolandi, professor and chair of the department of electrical and computer engineering, to serve as faculty director of the <a href="https://cied.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</a> (CIED).</p>
<p>CIED promotes the development, research, and teaching of innovation and entrepreneurship at UC Santa Cruz and its partners. The center works with faculty, students, and the Santa Cruz community to support technological innovation and entrepreneurship through a variety of programs and activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC students have a strong desire to change the world for the better, and entrepreneurship can be a way to do so,&#8221; Rolandi said.</p>
<p>Rolandi is taking the helm from Sue Carter, professor of physics, who has led the center since 2015. During her tenure as director, Carter was instrumental in getting support for UCSC entrepreneurs through programs such as <a href="https://www.blackstonelaunchpad.org/">Blackstone LaunchPad</a>, <a href="https://venturewell.org/">VentureWell</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/">National Science Foundation&#8217;s Innovation Corps</a>.</p>
<p>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer praised Carter&#8217;s leadership in creating new opportunities for students and expanding the campus&#8217;s entrepreneurial initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovation springs from all corners of our university and, under Sue&#8217;s leadership, the center helped students from all disciplines develop their entrepreneurial skills,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;She also worked tirelessly to create new opportunities for our inventors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rolandi&#8217;s appointment is effective July 1, 2021. Kletzer said she selected Rolandi to lead the center because of his strong track record in translating groundbreaking research into compelling startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marco understands the world of startups and the world of universities,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;He is well-positioned to build on the center&#8217;s past success and to create new collaborations that serve our campus community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rolandi&#8217;s research focuses on biological and bioinspired materials and their use in bioelectronic devices, which integrate electronics with biological systems. In 2017, he cofounded <a href="https://cruzfoam.com/">Cruz Foam</a> with John Felts, then a UCSC graduate student and now CEO of the Santa Cruz-based company. Cruz Foam makes environmentally friendly foam products using chitin, a material derived from shrimp shell waste.</p>
<p>Rolandi said he&#8217;s been impressed by the strong and supportive entrepreneurial environment in the Santa Cruz community and on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody I met when we were trying to start Cruz Foam was really nice to work with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a great feeling of support, both on campus and in the Santa Cruz and Monterey Bay community. People genuinely want everybody to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rolandi is also the scientific founder of KitoTech Medical, a Seattle-based medical device company launched in 2012 to develop a wound closure device. Then at the University of Washington, Seattle, Rolandi joined the faculty at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering in 2015. In 2017, he earned a Stanford LEAD Certificate in Corporate Innovation through a year-long executive education program at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Rolandi&#8217;s current research projects include a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/wound-healing.html">major collaborative program funded by DARPA</a> to develop a bioelectronic bandage to improve the healing of serious wounds. He earned his M.Sc. in physics at the University of London and Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University.</p>
<p>As director of CIED, Rolandi will partner with UCSC&#8217;s new Innovation and Business Engagement Hub, which will serve as the connection point for the campus&#8217;s innovation ecosystem and a consistent point of entry for potential industry partners and supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to working with all the current and future CIED partners and continuing to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Santa Cruz and Monterey Bay communities,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a864899d80727017480ce7268607d8e5"><name>filer-alumni-family</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proud Slugs making a difference through public service</title><summary>A Superior Court judge.

The director of the public art program for Los Angeles. A defense attorney. They all believe in public service, and they all say their time at UC Santa Cruz changed their lives in permanent ways
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is a Superior Court judge. The other runs the public art program for the City of Los Angeles. Still another is a defense attorney who recently opened her own practice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet they have a lot in common.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one thing, they share a last name: Filer. For another, they all believe in public service: Each graduated from UC Santa Cruz, and all said their time on the wooded campus changed their lives in permanent ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Kelvin (judge), Felicia (public art administrator), and Kree (lawyer), three members of a respected Los Angeles&#8211;area family and all proud Slugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their story actually starts with Kelvin&#8217;s father, Maxcy Filer, who left rural Arkansas and landed in Compton in the 1950s with a wife and seven kids. He worked as a milkman, a factory laborer, and a parking lot attendant, but he dreamed of becoming a lawyer. Kelvin Filer remembered how, when he was 9, his father enrolled in law school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My parents were very involved in the civil rights movement,&#8221; said Kelvin Filer (Stevenson &#8217;77, politics). &#8220;My father was on the Compton City Council, started the Compton branch of the NAACP, and carried the California flag during [Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s] March on Washington. But he also holds the record for taking the California Bar exam.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maxcy Filer took the test 48 times before he passed. From 1967 to 1991.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Whatever it is you want to do, you can do it'</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His father&#8217;s passion for justice, and Kelvin Filer&#8217;s growing suspicion as a boy that the attorneys he met were important people, inspired him to become a lawyer himself. He was accepted to UC Berkeley&#8217;s School of Law after UC Santa Cruz and, unlike his father, he passed the Bar on his first try.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelvin Filer could have had his pick of high-powered law firms. Instead, he returned as a defense attorney to his hometown of Compton, a working-class city where approximately 26 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. There, he purchased a building to house his office, the same building where the former owner of a bar and restaurant had once refused to serve Kelvin Filer&#8217;s father because he was Black, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now one of 66 African American judges in Los Angeles County, which counts 588 jurists, Kelvin Filer&#8217;s roots are firmly planted in Compton.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, he said, judges are asked to list the top three courthouses where they might like to work. Kelvin Filer always answers: 1) Compton, 2) Compton, 3) Compton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking from his ninth-floor chambers at the Compton courthouse where he can see all the schools he attended along with the roof of his mother&#8217;s house, Kelvin Filer said: &#8220;This is the best way I can show the Compton community that whatever it is you want to do, you can do it,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for UC Santa Cruz, Kelvin Filer said it changed him by exposing him to different cultures, religions, and sexual orientations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I realized we were all humans and we all cared about education and wanting to change the world and to help people," he said. "It is a very liberal institution, and that touched me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also where he met his former wife, Felicia Filer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Felicia Filer, there were only eight Black students at Stevenson College when she attended the university, and they all hung out together. She and Kelvin were friends at first, then became romantically involved when he was in his last year of law school. Kelvin Filer remembers it slightly differently, however.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I first saw her [at Stevenson], I said, &#8216;There goes my wife,&#8217;&#8221; he recounted.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawn into art</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 1979 with a degree in economics, Felicia Filer went to work in the financial services world, landing jobs with Charles Schwab and the former Paine Webber in San Francisco. Eventually, she got her broker&#8217;s license and developed her own list of clients. Later, she earned an MBA and began working in the financial research field. After all those years of dealing with money, however, something shifted inside Felicia Filer after the birth of her second child.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to work with people who were creative,&#8221; she said, &#8220;people creating something instead of people consuming something.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;d taken theater technology courses at UC Santa Cruz and studied dance on her own, so she looked to the art world. With her prodigious financial skills, she quickly landed a job with a Los Angeles management firm that worked with nonprofit art organizations. Soon, however, she was lured away to work at the Department of Cultural Affairs for the City of Los Angeles, where she is now director of the public art division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing this for 25 years,&#8221; Felicia Filer said. &#8220;I thought I would come to the city and stay five years and move on, but that didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Felicia Filer is responsible for commissioning more than 250 works of art scattered across the sprawling city of Los Angeles.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is art at every police station, every fire station, every library, and park in the city, she said. Walk through the international terminal at LAX and you&#8217;ll see three large works that are there because of the work of Felicia Filer and her division. There also are scores of murals in neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, she works with legislative bodies to craft ordinance and policies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz changed her too, creating what she called &#8220;a deconstruction and reconstruction,&#8221; a crucial component of the college experience, she said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I came to Santa Cruz, I started riding my bike around campus and downtown. I learned to hike in Henry Cowell [State Park] and in the redwood forest," she said. "I went to Yosemite and Big Sur. I joined a cooking co-op, and we managed a garden. I started going to farmer&#8217;s markets and was introduced to vegetarianism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today, all of those things are prevalent in my life. I have a vegetable garden. I ride my bike to the farmer's market, and I am an avid hiker. For kids from urban centers, we come with an edge, and if you just learn to soften the edge and let down your guard, the magic of Santa Cruz starts to work on you. Those experiences [at UC Santa Cruz] have completely and profoundly shaped who I am and how I live my life today.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation matters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an experience not unlike the one her daughter, Kree Filer (Oakes &#8217;12, feminist studies with a concentration on law, politics, and social justice) had. Not only did the campus steer her toward a career in law, but also the campus culture of environmental stewardship turned her more toward nature, to the importance of buying locally grown food and supporting local businesses, she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also weaned her of her LA driving habit. She joked that she surprised her parents by announcing, &#8220;I walk now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, perhaps, UC Santa Cruz also influenced her decision to become a defense attorney.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Kree Filer, despite the plethora of attorneys in her family (there are five), she didn&#8217;t want to be a lawyer when she came to Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then I began learning about the prison industrial complex and reading about the stigmas that individuals who have been incarcerated face when they are released from prison, and I began to think about the law from a more academic and feminist perspective,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remember thinking: I want to fight for those who don&#8217;t have access to the legal system. I want people to understand how the law works and who it protects and who it leaves out, and I want to work in that system for the people who might not have representation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing the Bar, she worked for her cousin&#8217;s law firm, then got a position as a staff attorney for the nonprofit legal agency, The Los Angeles Dependency Lawyers. But it was her desire to start her own business and also represent those who, because of their financial status or the color of their skin were often swept into an unjust system, that prompted her to open her own office, The Filer Law Office in Long Beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope, ultimately, by the end of my career, when I look back, I will have made a difference,&#8221; Kree Filer said, &#8220;but right now I look at the small things I can do. Part of it is that representation matters. Brown and Black people are disproportionally prosecuted. To be a Black woman and represent those individuals &#8230; in a system that does not always fare well for people who look like me, that&#8217;s something I can do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why she also decided to make her own statement, just as her parents and grandfather had done.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Black professional women are often pressured to straighten their locks, Kree Filer said, she plans to wear her natural hair on the job.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is something I do very intentionally, particularly when I have a big hearing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I make it a point to wear my hair out. I want to break down the stigma of what a professional Black woman looks like.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/02/1063.html</url><title>Compton Superior Court Judge Kelvin D.

Some of her prior research has explored the role of gender in the economics profession. And most recently, she&#8217;s been studying how physical appearance affects long-term career success for economists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In academics, we really want to believe that it&#8217;s all about merit,&#8221; Hale said. &#8220;There are some papers showing that teaching evaluations are better for better-looking faculty, and you could maybe make the argument that, if you're more attractive, students pay more attention. But for academic research, I'm just crunching data, so what does it matter what I look like?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/km0f8wl27ip9czd/HaleRegevRubinstein.pdf?dl=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest working paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hale and coauthors investigated this question by following the careers of 752 economists who graduated from top economics doctoral programs in the United States between 2002 and 2006. The research team was surprised to find that, in fact, physical attractiveness was a strong and persistent predictor for both job outcomes and research success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine relative attractiveness among the economists, a random group of 241 online survey workers rated photos of each economist in the sample. Then researchers compared these ratings with economists&#8217; career outcomes over a 15-year period. The first interesting finding was that attractive individuals were more likely to study at higher-ranked Ph.D. programs. Women&#8217;s looks in top programs were particularly skewed toward the higher end of the attractiveness scale, compared to their male colleagues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduate school, both male and female economists who ranked higher in attractiveness landed better first jobs, and attractive individuals continued to find better academic job placements up to 15 years later. Looks were also related to research success. While more attractive economists didn&#8217;t necessarily publish more papers, their papers were cited more often by other researchers. These trends held up even after controlling for the effect of the ranking of the university each economist attended or where they got their first job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The connection between attractiveness and research citations was particularly surprising, but Hale suspects it&#8217;s related to the fact that many economists present their papers at conferences, which links their physical appearance to their research. Overall, the influence of attractiveness may indicate implicit bias, and there could be a correlation with racial inequality too.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The very obvious implication is that we really shouldn't discriminate against people who are not judged to be as attractive as others,&#8221; Hale said. &#8220;The other part of the problem is: what are the attractiveness standards in the cultural group that dominates the profession?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey workers who rated photos for the study were predominantly white, and their rankings of attractiveness did differ across races of the rated economists. Specifically, men who &#8220;looked Asian&#8221; to survey workers were rated lower than white peers. But any potential biases in the economics profession may not fully explain what&#8217;s impacting career success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale and her coauthors learned from psychology literature that people who are considered more attractive get more positive reinforcement as they grow up, which can affect confidence in adulthood. Confidence, in turn, could affect career success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to disentangle this,&#8221; Hale said. &#8220;If one reason why papers are cited more often is that they&#8217;re presented in front of peers better or more often, perhaps people are invited to conferences more because they&#8217;re better presenters. And perhaps they&#8217;re better presenters because they grew up better looking and are more confident and comfortable with public speaking.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that&#8217;s the case, Hale says interventions could actually begin in early childhood to help set the next generation up for success. But in the meantime, the economics profession&#8212;and academia as a whole&#8212;has a lot of work to do in order to understand and correct for biases within the field. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a90aa81b80727017480ce72676d020fa"><name>alumni-week-2021-overview</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Week 2021: Bringing the festivities to you!</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz's all-virtual Alumni Week will offer both Slugs and the community a wide menu of smart, interesting, and just-plain-fun events, wherever you may be on the globe.&#13;

With some 60 virtual events planned&#8212;from a thought-provoking conversation about the afterlife of slavery with writer and scholar Saidaya Hartman, to a discussion with biomolecular engineer Ed Green about solving crime by using cutting-edge DNA techniques he&#8217;s developed, to classes on Kombucha-making&#8212;the week is full of smart, interesting, and some just-plain-fun events. Best of all, registration can be made on the same day and, even if you&#8217;re living in another country, you&#8217;ll be able to attend. All events are Pacific Time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week kicks into high gear when literary critic and UC Santa Cruz Professor of Literature Vilashini Cooppan and UC Santa Cruz Associate History Professor Greg O&#8217;Malley join in conversation with Hartman, whose books and essays have explored </span><strong>the legacy of slavery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it still haunts America today. One of the few people who can claim a MacArthur Genius Fellowship and also an appearance in a Jay-Z video, Hartman has penned books that are provocative, eye-opening, and thoughtful&#8212;exactly how this conversation, sponsored by The Humanities Institute, will be. </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/Saidiya_hartman_the_afterlife_of_slavery#.YGzHhrRKg2I"><strong>Saidiya Hartman: The Afterlife of Slavery</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set for Monday, April 19, at 4 p.m.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><strong>true crime,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or even fictional crime, is your thing, you&#8217;ll want to tune in to a conversation with UC Santa Cruz Professor Ed Green for the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/kraw_lecture_the_past_present_and_future_of_dna-based_forensics#.YGzH9LRKg2K"><strong>Kraw Lecture: The past, present, and future of DNA-based forensics</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, April 22, at 5:30 p.m. Green&#8217;s work with ancient DNA led him to develop a technique that has made it possible to recover and sequence DNA from crime-scene evidence like old hair and degraded semen samples&#8212;something not thought possible by forensic investigators before now. He has worked with law enforcement and the FBI on dozens of cold cases, helping not only in identifying suspects but also giving a name to long-ago victims. His work has been called a &#8220;game changer&#8221; by detectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, who can ignore </span><strong>politics</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in these charged times?

Professor Ian Garrick-Bethell and associate researcher Mikhail Kreslavsky, both in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UCSC, are among the participating scientists who will join the KPLO science team.</p>
<p>Set to launch in August 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and orbit the moon for about a year, KPLO is the first space exploration mission of the Republic of Korea (ROK) that will travel beyond Earth orbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The KPLO Participating Scientist Program is an example of how international collaborations can leverage the talents of two space agencies to achieve greater science and exploration success than individual missions,&#8221; said KPLO Project Manager Sang-Ryool Lee. &#8220;It&#8217;s fantastic that the Korea Aerospace Research Institute lunar mission has NASA as a partner in space exploration&#8212;we&#8217;re excited to see the new knowledge and opportunities that will arise from the KPLO mission as well as from future joint KARI&#8211;NASA activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each of the nine participating scientists will join the KPLO science team for at least one of the five KPLO instruments beginning later this year and will be funded for three years. Kreslavsky will take part in the study of lunar polarimetric anomalies using PolCam, a wide-angle polarimetric camera. Garrick-Bethell will be studying the lithospheric magnetic field of the moon using the KPLO magnetometer, KMAG.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is still a mystery how a body as small as the Moon could have once supported a magnetic dynamo in its tiny liquid iron core. The magnetometer on KPLO will provide important new measurements to address this mystery,&#8221; Garrick-Bethell said.</p>
<p>The three overarching goals of the KPLO mission are realizing the first space exploration mission by ROK, developing and verifying space technologies suitable for deep-space exploration on future missions, and investigating the physical characteristics of the lunar surface to aid future robotic landing missions to the moon.</p>
<p>To meet these objectives, the spacecraft will carry a payload of five scientific instruments to include three cameras, a magnetometer, and a gamma-ray spectrometer. NASA is contributing one of the cameras, known as ShadowCam, which will be used to obtain optical images at high resolution of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar poles of the moon that are thought to contain ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that the participating scientists are fully embedded in the existing KARI and NASA teams well before the mission is due to launch,&#8221; said Shoshana Weider from NASA&#8217;s Planetary Science Division, who leads the KPLO Participating Scientist Program. &#8220;This means they will have plenty of time to collaborate with their KARI colleagues during the pre-launch mission-planning phase, which will help ensure that the science return of their projects, and the mission as a whole, is maximized.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moon will be the focus of many robotic and human exploration missions in the coming years, including those under NASA&#8217;s Artemis program. Beginning later this year, NASA will send science instruments and technology experiments on two separate robotic landers to the lunar surface. The KPLO lunar mission will provide scientific data to better understand the lunar poles and assist planning for some Artemis activities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

featuring a panel of experts and a series of short films</article-subhead><article-text><p>The seventh annual <a href="https://confrontingclimatechange.ucsc.edu/">Confronting Climate Change Conference</a> at UC Santa Cruz will focus on <strong>Food Security in a Changing World</strong>, bringing together experts in climate science, food systems, and policy to discuss how we can adapt to feed a growing population during unprecedented changes in our planet&#8217;s climate, culture, and political landscape.</p>
<p>This free public event will be held virtually via Zoom on Wednesday and Thursday, April 28 and 29. Separate advance registrations are required to attend the <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_S2-8xe2rRb6UnRAeYY32fQ">April 28 Sustainability Film program</a> and the <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5Lm9YcoQR_OOyx5ssdn0yA">April 29 Food Security program</a>. <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5Lm9YcoQR_OOyx5ssdn0yA"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is already affecting food security through rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather. Our food systems will have to adapt, and it will be important to consider the impacts on the most vulnerable populations as we plan for an uncertain future,&#8221; said Paul Koch, professor of Earth and planetary science and dean of the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, which is cosponsoring the event.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 28, two short films from UCSC&#8217;s Social Documentation MFA program will be the focus of a panel discussion organized by the Arts Division. The films, which will be available for on-demand viewing before the event, focus broadly on sustainable food sources of traditional communities.</p>
<p>Day two of the conference (Thursday, April 29) features a panel discussion on food security with experts on climate change, food systems, and economics, moderated by <strong>Stacy Philpott</strong>, professor of environmental studies and director of the <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS)</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so much information now on how the current industrial agriculture model is not sustainable and is a contributing factor causing climate change, so I&#8217;m looking forward to having the panel discuss the potential solutions they see and the ways in which more sustainable agricultural practices can help us adapt to climate change and meet people&#8217;s needs for food security,&#8221; Philpott said. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to bring together a panel with such diverse areas of expertise and have them engage in conversation with one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panelists will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Noah Diffenbaugh</strong>, the Kara J. Foundation Professor of Earth System Science and Kimmelman Family Senior Fellow at Stanford University. Diffenbaugh, who earned his Ph.D. in Earth sciences at UCSC in 2003, studies the climate system, including the processes by which climate change could impact agriculture, water resources, and human health.</li>
<li><strong>Aditi Sen</strong>, a lead policy advisor at Oxfam, a global organization that works to end the injustice of poverty. Sen&#8217;s work focuses on the nexus of climate change, food, and land use and addresses the drivers and impacts of climate change stemming from food systems, particularly on vulnerable communities across the world.</li>
<li><strong>Galina Hale</strong>, professor of economics at UC Santa Cruz. In addition to her research on international financial markets and financial stability, Hale has been looking at how the financial system can help solve problems related to climate risks and what economists can do to promote a more sustainable food system.</li>
<li><strong>Naya Jones</strong>, an assistant professor of sociology, critical geographer, and cultural worker at UC Santa Cruz. Jones studies Black geographies of community health and healing in North and Latin America. Her work on food sovereignty especially considers embodiment: she asks how food sovereignty and food access feel, and how embodied knowledge matters for collective thriving, policymaking, and movement-building. Her current book project focuses on African-American gardening and migration beyond the South.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the discussion, there will be time for questions from the audience.</p>
<p>The following films will be discussed in the panel on Wednesday, April 28:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>El Cacao:</em></strong> An indigenous farmer in Panama confronts environmental and economic complexities of growing, harvesting, and selling cacao beans for the global chocolate market.</li>
<li><strong><em>Open Line:</em></strong> A Yup&#8217;ik fisherwoman teaches her son how to fish for salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska, while an impassioned debate over a proposed open-pit copper mine is taking place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Filmmakers <strong>Michelle Aguilar</strong> and <strong>Andr&#233;s Camacho</strong> will join in a panel discussion moderated by <strong>Rita Mehta</strong>, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and <strong>Daniel Costa</strong>, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences. <strong>Nancy Chen</strong>, professor of anthropology, will provide introductory remarks.</p>
<p>In addition to the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the co-sponsors of this year's climate conference include the UC Santa Cruz academic divisions of the Arts, Graduate Studies, and Social Sciences. The film panel is presented in cooperation with UCSC's Seymour Marine Discovery Center.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-30-2021</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b1fb7e7680727017480ce726a3db90a8"><name>security-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Town hall on how to protect your information following UC data breach</title><summary>UCSC Information Security will hold a town hall following the data breach that is affecting the UC community.</summary><start-date>1617692400000</start-date><display-name>Town hall on how to protect your information following UC data breach</display-name><path>/2021/04/security-town-hall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/security-town-hall</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1617893752398</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617893752398</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UCSC Information Security will hold a town hall following the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/update-on-accellion-breach-and-what-you-should-do.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617978669139000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBOSW5bu64vIRmDxgt2KsR0giOPg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/update-on-accellion-breach-and-what-you-should-do.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>data breach</span></a><span> that is affecting the UC community.

A new study, however, describes several scenarios in which a lifeless rocky planet around a sun-like star could evolve to have oxygen in its atmosphere.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020AV000294">published April 13 in <em>AGU Advances</em></a>, highlight the need for next-generation telescopes that are capable of characterizing planetary environments and searching for multiple lines of evidence for life in addition to detecting oxygen.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is useful because it shows there are ways to get oxygen in the atmosphere without life, but there are other observations you can make to help distinguish these false positives from the real deal,&#8221; said first author Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a Sagan Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;For each scenario, we try to say what your telescope would need to be able to do to distinguish this from biological oxygen.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the coming decades, perhaps by the late 2030s, astronomers hope to have a telescope capable of taking images and spectra of potentially Earth-like planets around sun-like stars. Coauthor Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of UCSC&#8217;s Other Worlds Laboratory, said the idea would be to target planets similar enough to Earth that life might have emerged on them and characterize their atmospheres.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has a been a lot of discussion about whether detection of oxygen is &#8216;enough&#8217; of a sign of life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This work really argues for needing to know the context of your detection. What other molecules are found in addition to oxygen, or not found, and what does that tell you about the planet's evolution?&#8221;</p>
<p>This means astronomers will want a telescope that is sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths in order to detect different types of molecules in a planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<h4>Rocky planet evolution</h4>
<p>The researchers based their findings on a detailed, end-to-end computational model of the evolution of rocky planets, starting from their molten origins and extending through billions of years of cooling and geochemical cycling. By varying the initial inventory of volatile elements in their model planets, the researchers obtained a surprisingly wide range of outcomes.</p>
<p>Oxygen can start to build up in a planet&#8217;s atmosphere when high-energy ultraviolet light splits water molecules in the upper atmosphere into hydrogen and oxygen. The lightweight hydrogen preferentially escapes into space, leaving the oxygen behind. Other processes can remove oxygen from the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen released by outgassing from molten rock, for example, will react with oxygen, and weathering of rock also mops up oxygen. These are just a few of the processes the researchers incorporated into their model of the geochemical evolution of a rocky planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you run the model for Earth, with what we think was the initial inventory of volatiles, you reliably get the same outcome every time&#8212;without life you don&#8217;t get oxygen in the atmosphere,&#8221; Krissansen-Totton said. &#8220;But we also found multiple scenarios where you can get oxygen without life.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, a planet that is otherwise like Earth but starts off with more water will end up with very deep oceans, putting immense pressure on the crust. This effectively shuts down geological activity, including all of the processes such as melting or weathering of rocks that would remove oxygen from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the opposite case, where the planet starts off with a relatively small amount of water, the magma surface of the initially molten planet can freeze quickly while the water remains in the atmosphere. This &#8220;steam atmosphere&#8221; puts enough water in the upper atmosphere to allow accumulation of oxygen as the water breaks up and hydrogen escapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The typical sequence is that the magma surface solidifies simultaneously with water condensing out into oceans on the surface,&#8221; Krissansen-Totton said. &#8220;On Earth, once water condensed on the surface, escape rates were low. But if you retain a steam atmosphere after the molten surface has solidified, there&#8217;s a window of about a million years when oxygen can build up because there are high water concentrations in the upper atmosphere and no molten surface to consume the oxygen produced by hydrogen escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third scenario that can lead to oxygen in the atmosphere involves a planet that is otherwise like Earth but starts off with a higher ratio of carbon dioxide to water. This leads to a runaway greenhouse effect, making it too hot for water to ever condense out of the atmosphere onto the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this Venus-like scenario, all the volatiles start off in the atmosphere and few are left behind in the mantle to be outgassed and mop up oxygen,&#8221; Krissansen-Totton said.</p>
<p>He noted that previous studies have focused on atmospheric processes, whereas the model used in this study explores the geochemical and thermal evolution of the planet&#8217;s mantle and crust, as well as the interactions between the crust and atmosphere.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 75 institutions, including UC Santa Cruz, that signed on to the letter span 29 different states, in all regions of the United States. The letter also represents a wide diversity of institution types, including large research universities, community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), tribal colleges, regional comprehensive universities, and liberal arts colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden-Harris administration re-entered the Paris Agreement in February and needs to submit a carbon emission goal, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). The goal advocated for by higher education institutions would help put the United States on a viable path to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter commends the Biden-Harris administration for their leadership on, and commitment to, detering climate change and emphasizes the crucial need to address climate change now, while there is still time for the United States to act. Higher education institutions also shared their own commitment to advancing climate action.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the central role higher education plays in society, we affirm that solving global challenges, like the challenges posed by global climate change, is a key part of our educational missions,&#8221; the letter states. &#8220;Through our curriculum, research, and operations, we will continue to be engines of innovation driving climate solutions in this country, and around the world, in the years ahead.&#8221;</span></p>

White Distinguished Annual Lecture</i></strong>, a virtual event that takes place on April 19.</span></p>
<p><span>A scholar of African American literature and cultural history, Hartman explores the afterlife of slavery in modern American life, bringing to light stories of rarely documented lives that have been systematically excluded from historical archives.</span></p>
<p><span>She is the author of <i>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments</i>; <i>Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route</i>; and <i>Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The recipient of a 2019 MacArthur &#8220;Genius&#8221; Fellowship, Hartman has been a Guggenheim Fellow, Cullman Fellow, and Fulbright Scholar. She is a professor at Columbia University and has contributed to <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, and such journals as <i>South Atlantic Quarterly</i>, <i>Brick</i>, <i>Small Axe</i>, and <i>Callaloo</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>In an article last October in the<i> </i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life"><i><strong>New Yorker</strong></i></a> titled &#8220;How Saidiya Hartman Retells the History of Black life,&#8221; writer Alexis Okeowo observed:</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;In three books and a series of essays, Hartman has explored the interior lives of enslaved people and their descendants, employing a method that she says &#8216;troubles the line between history and imagination.&#8217; Her iconoclastic thinking on the legacy of slavery in American life has prefigured the current cultural moment. In 2008, five years before Black Lives Matter was founded, she wrote of &#8216;a past that has yet to be done, and the ongoing state of emergency in which black life remains in peril.&#8217; Her writing has become a lodestar for a generation of students and, increasingly, for politically engaged people outside the academy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>As Hartman noted in her book, <i>Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route</i>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery--skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In the interdisciplinary spirit</strong> of the late innovative&#160;scholar and&#160;historian Hayden White, Hartman will engage in a public conversation with two UC Santa Cruz humanities scholars&#8212;professor of literature Vilashini Cooppan and associate professor of history Greg O&#8217;Malley.</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley is the author of </span><span><i>Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</i></span><span>, a 2015 book that has won multiple awards for helping to redraw the map of the forced African migration during the slave trade era. They include the American Historical Association&#8217;s Forkosch Prize for British history; the AHA&#8217;s Rawley Prize for Atlantic history; The Owsley Award from the Southern Historical Association; and the Goveia Prize from the Association of Caribbean Historians. He is currently working on a new book, <i>The Escapes of David George: An Odyssey of Slavery and Freedom in the Revolutionary Era</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>Cooppan teaches comparative and world literature, with an emphasis on postcolonial theory, genre theory, memory studies, and affect theory. She has published extensively on world literature, and on memory and trauma. Cooppan is the author of <i>Worlds Within: National Narratives and Global Connections in Postcolonial Writing</i>&#160;and is completing a book titled <i>The World at Large: Memoryscapes in World Literature</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>The Hayden V. White Distinguished Annual Lecture Series is made<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><span>possible by the support of the Thomas H. and Josephine Baird Memorial Fund, an endowment that supports yearly lectures relevant to historical and cultural theory, and to ensure that Hayden White&#8217;s legacy and intellectual spirit is honored and sustained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

(Photo by M. Beck)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Coral reefs provide many services to coastal communities, including critical protection from flood damage. A new study led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the U.S. Geological Survey reveals how valuable coral reefs are in protecting people, structures, and economic activity in the United States from coastal flooding during storms.</p>
<p><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41893-021-00706-6"></a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00706-6">Published April 15 in <em>Nature Sustain</em><em></em><em>ability</em></a><em>,</em> the study found that coral reefs offer more than $1.8 billion in annual flood protection to coastal communities. Losing 1 meter of reef height would cause 100-year flooding zones to increase by 23%, impacting 53,800 more people (a 62% increase) and 90% more property and increasing damages by $5.3 billion.</p>
<p>The study also found that the United States has 200 miles (325 kilometers) of high-value reefs that are worth more than $1.6 million per mile ($1 million per kilometer) annually for flood protection alone. Most of these high-value reefs are in Florida and Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;Valuing the flood risk-reduction service of existing ecosystems is one step toward managing them as natural infrastructure,&#8221; said lead author Borja Reguero, an associate researcher at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This study provides new local information on how reefs protect communities at the building-block level, while maintaining a national focus for policy purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers combined computer models of storms and waves with engineering, ecological, mapping, social, and economic tools to create detailed and rigorous estimates of the value of coral reef defenses along U.S. coastlines. They analyzed flood risk and assessed reef benefits along the reef-lined coasts of Hawaii, Florida, Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<h4>Informing management</h4>
<p>Information from the study is intended for use by a wide variety of coastal managers working on flood mitigation, coastal defense, transportation, and hurricane response and recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results identify how, where and when U.S. coral reefs provide the most significant coastal flood reduction benefits, helping state and territorial agencies better direct efforts to safeguard lives, avoid economic losses, and meet the goals of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to protect and preserve U.S. coral reefs,&#8221; said co-author Curt Storlazzi, a USGS research geologist.</p>
<p>The study also calculates how much critical infrastructure&#8212;such as hospitals, fire stations, roads, and power plants&#8212;coral reefs protect from coastal flooding. To produce these results, the researchers developed new computer models that can forecast flood damages with and without coral reefs all along the shoreline at very high resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achieving this kind of definition required a complex modeling strategy to account for all the processes relevant in coral reef environments, which are significantly different to those driving flooding in other coastlines,&#8221; Reguero said. &#8220;The approach can also be applied to other ecosystems, and it now allows assessing the impacts of future changes in storms or sea level rise too.&#8221;</p>
<p>While sea level rise is a growing threat to coastal communities and economies, losing ecosystems like coral reefs can have comparable effects in much shorter timeframes. Reefs are in trouble across the U.S., but they can recover if resources are invested in their management and restoration, according to coauthor Michael Beck, who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work quantifies the critical role of reefs in flood mitigation and provides the evidence needed to invest hazard management, disaster recovery, and insurance funds in these natural defenses,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;We are glad to see that some of the key data and results from this work are already being used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Nature Conservancy to inform reef restoration and new insurance options for reefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Reguero, Beck and Storlazzi, the coauthors include Ann Gibbs and Kristen Cumming at the USGS and James Shope and Aaron Cole at UC Santa Cruz. This research was supported in part by the USGS through the Coastal and Marine Hazards and Resources Program&#8217;s Coral Reef Project and by the U.S. Department of Interior, Office of Insular Affairs.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-04-11/reefs-wetlands-mangrove-coastline-defense-restoration</url><title>L.A.

The event&#8217;s more than 245 attendees came from IT communities at both Stanford and UC Santa Cruz, and other UC schools and beyond. A video of his talk is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xuk7P48_cqXTK9E5JVg3SuGA1GL-9QuO/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.<br/> <br/>During an hour-long conversation with Gallagher and a Q&amp;A that followed, Williams discussed his career journey, lessons learned, thoughts about diversity and inclusion, and traits he has found to be most important in his leadership approach.<br/><br/>He outlined eight actions organizations can take to address racial injustice in the workplace:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Encourage mentorships</li>
<li>Provide sponsorships</li>
<li>Offer training</li>
<li>Provide advocacy</li>
<li>Serve as models who provide inspiration</li>
<li>Partner with shared interest groups</li>
<li>Focus on recruitment and retention</li>
<li>Create opportunities for women and people of color</li>
</ol>
<p>Williams joined UCSC as vice chancellor for information technology July 1, 2018 from New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, where he was chief information officer. He spent more than 15 years at Stern in a variety of&#160; roles including chief technology officer and senior director of enterprise operations and solutions. He holds a master's degree in business administration from Stern, and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in classical civilization from NYU.</p>
<p>Williams acknowledged that transitioning from the very diverse environment at NYU to UCSC required him to become more comfortable in his own skin and to advocate more strongly for diversity from his leadership position.</p>
<p>When Stanford&#8217;s Gallagher asked what it means to be a person of color in the ranks of IT leadership, Williams also acknowledged the pressures of modeling behaviors and being a change agent for his staff of 250. He also noted that he has benefitted during his own career from connections with other inclusive leaders.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xuk7P48_cqXTK9E5JVg3SuGA1GL-9QuO/view?usp=sharing</url><title>Archived video of Van Williams talk (begins at 6:04)</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://itcommunity.stanford.edu/news/poc-it-hosts-van-williams-vice-chancellor-it-and-strategic-technology-initiatives-uc-santa</url><title>Stanford IT Community article on the event  </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c79f472980727017480ce726614029c5"><name>covid-relief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL21) for COVID-19 relief available to all employees in 2021</title><summary>This communication is to inform you of a recent update on the University of California’s (University) COVID-19 Related Leaves for policy-covered and represented academic and staff employees.&#13;

<div>This communication is to inform you of a recent update on the University of California&#8217;s (University) COVID-19 Related Leaves for policy-covered and represented academic and staff employees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) into law, which gives employers the option to offer their employees Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL21) in 2021. On March 19, 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom approved Senate Bill 95 (SB 95) which entitled most California employees to a new bank of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave. Effective March 29, 2021, the University is providing up to 80 hours of EPSL21 for full-time employees and the two-week equivalent for part-time employees. The University&#8217;s EPSL21 program is more generous than ARPA and SB95.</div>
<div></div>
<div>EPSL21 is available to employees who are unable to work or telework due to COVID-19 for one or more of the following reasons:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reason 1:</strong> The employee is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID 19.</li>
<li><strong>Reason 2: </strong>The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19.</li>
<li><strong>Reason 3:&#160;</strong>
<ul>
<li>The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis from a health care provider;</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> The employee has been exposed to COVID-19 and is seeking or awaiting the results of a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, COVID-19;</li>
<li><strong>New: </strong>The University has requested that the employee obtain a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, COVID-19, and the employee is seeking or awaiting those results;</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> The employee is obtaining immunization related to COVID-19;&#160;</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> The employee is recovering from an injury, disability, illness, or condition related to obtaining immunization related to COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reason 4: </strong>The employee is caring for an individual who is either subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 or who has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19.</li>
<li><strong>Reason 5:</strong> The employee is caring for their child whose school or place of care has closed (or whose child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19.</li>
<li><strong>Reason 6: </strong>The employee is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div><strong>Effective Dates</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>EPSL21 is effective March 29, 2021 through September 30, 2021. Full-time employees may take up to 80 hours of EPSL21, while those who are part-time may take up to the two-week equivalent. As before, employees will receive their regular rate of pay during EPSL21. Although the law allows employers to place caps on pay for EPSL, the University has once again decided not to apply these caps. If an employee has an EPSL21 leave in progress as of September 30, 2021, the employee will be allowed to finish taking the amount of EPSL21 that they are entitled to receive until their allotment is exhausted or their qualifying reason ends.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, if an employee took any leave without pay between January 1, 202, &#160;and March 28, 2021, for one or more of the EPSL21 qualifying reasons, the employee may request that the University allow them to retroactively use EPSL21 by submitting a completed <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/2021-epsl-notice-and-request-form.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618339042483000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKpBzLGK1uIU9z1HRIa3estxlUzg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/2021-epsl-notice-and-request-form.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 EPSL Request Form</a> to their supervisor.</div>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest book by Thomas Pettigrew, Dickson Emeriti Professor of Social Psychology at UC Santa Cruz, traces his 65-year career to share the greatest themes, perspectives, and advances from his lifetime of work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pettigrew is an internationally renowned expert on racism and intergroup relations who has earned seven lifetime achievement awards from both psychology and sociology organizations. And now, in </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/contextual-social-psychology?tab=1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contextual Social Psychology</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he synthesizes his most important insights through a combination of personal stories, applied examples, and theoretical frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The basic idea behind this book is that I&#8217;ve always wanted to see psychology, which often focuses at the personal level, concentrate more on the larger social context through social psychology,&#8221; Pettigrew said. &#8220;And I felt this need strongly because I grew up in the South, and that was absolutely a social context for racism, prejudice, and everything else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the book, Pettigrew describes his youth, living in segregated Richmond, Va., during the 1930s and &#8216;40s. These formative experiences with structural racism would later shape his research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the way that society worked at that time, you couldn&#8217;t just think that racism was an individual thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You had to consider the laws, norms, and culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pettigrew became a leader and innovator in studying the social forces that enable prejudice. He followed these phenomena around the globe, studying racism in the American South, apartheid in South Africa, and discrimination against immigrants in Western Europe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new book summarizes his major theories on these issues, including how social norms and resentments drive prejudice, how contact between groups reduces prejudice, and how racism can drive far-right voting patterns. Pettigrew sees phenomena from contextual social psychology in many of today&#8217;s toughest challenges, so he hopes the insights from his book might better equip new generations to make progress in addressing these issues.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For general readers, I want them to come away with the idea that social science of many types can help to explain major phenomena like prejudice, or the racist voting behaviors behind the 2016 Donald Trump election victory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Social science can give explanations of these phenomena that you don&#8217;t get in the popular press.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c80021e080727017480ce726276d18d8"><name>spring-chancellor-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>May 6th Spring Forum with Chancellor Larive</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board seeks to continue supporting staff by amplifying your voices to campus leadership.

<p>Wisser, director of UC Santa Cruz Environmental Health and Safety, and Risk Services, was responsible for providing employees with safety equipment and was stunned that masks weren&#8217;t available for purchase. Even hospitals couldn&#8217;t get enough masks for their staff at that time.</p>
<p>As someone in the field for over 20 years, Wisser had participated in planning exercises for pandemics numerous times. &#8220;This was not something that our country never thought about before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How our country could not be ready for a pandemic was shocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>While watching the pandemic unfold in early 2020, the EH&amp;S team realized that face coverings were going to be essential for employees who needed to work together on campus. The team scrambled to find anything that would work, from refurbished N95 respirators to bandanas to cloth masks hand-sewn by the theater department costume shop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EH&amp;S team came together to help each of the on site &#8220;essential&#8221; groups reduce the risk of COVID spread in their work areas. They helped rearrange spaces for physical distancing and provided in person or Zoom information sessions to help employees understand how to protect themselves at work and at home. EH&amp;S and Risk Services staff continue to provide this outreach today.</p>
<p>The next big hurdle was figuring out how to serve employees who wanted to keep their own work space cleaned with disinfectant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">recommends disinfecting</a> frequently touched surfaces daily, such as desks and keyboards, to protect yourself against the virus.</p>
<p>Early on in the pandemic, EPA-approved disinfectant was also sold out. So UC Santa Cruz EH&amp;S decided to set up its own bulk dispenser bottling operation at the brand-new EH&amp;S facility on Heller Road. The team filled thousands of personal-use bottles with the same highly effective disinfectant used by campus custodial services. The disinfectant program was designed with sustainability in mind, as bottles can be returned for refilling rather than disposed.</p>
<p>A constant challenge throughout the pandemic has been staying updated with current information about the disease. Wisser followed all the main public health agencies including the CDC, the California Department of Public Health and Santa Cruz County Public Health, as well as the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The different agencies were not always unanimous about the best actions to take, Wisser said. As an example, the CDC recommended face coverings before the state required them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were definitely different recommendations coming from different places at different times,&#8221; Wisser said. &#8220;We would always take the most protective approach at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of keeping up with the latest recommendations, she was part of daily UC-system wide phone calls about how to respond to the pandemic. &#8220;This is a great example of the &#8216;Power of 10&#8217; concept,&#8221; she said referring to the number of UC campuses that worked together to share information.</p>
<p>Looking back, she said what she has learned the most from the experience is the importance of good communication. &#8220;You need to tell people what you know and what you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You need to get back to them and say, &#8216;I know we talked about this last week, but the information just changed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She is grateful that vaccines are now available, but she doesn&#8217;t feel close to ready to let down her guard yet.</p>
<p>The university is planning to get most students back on campus for classes in the fall, which will entail a lot of preparations. She and others who work in Environmental Health and Safety and Risk Services will not be getting a break for a while.</p>
<p>Though the advent of vaccines makes things more hopeful, there is no slowing down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines are a light at the end of the tunnel,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very positive moment and it definitely helps. But just because we have a vaccine, it&#8217;s not over. We&#8217;re not there yet.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cc1b7dd380727017480ce726e9016b65"><name>tuna-carbon-footprint</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study of U.S. tuna fisheries explores nexus of climate change, sustainable seafood</title><summary>A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA examines traditional aspects of seafood sustainability alongside greenhouse gas emissions to better understand the carbon footprint of U.S. tuna fisheries. </summary><start-date>1618297200000</start-date><display-name>Tuna fisheries carbon footprint</display-name><path>/2021/04/tuna-carbon-footprint</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/tuna-carbon-footprint</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1618332057010</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1618530169626</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/tuna-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/tuna-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tuna-350.jpg</name><display-name>tuna-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72858</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Seared tuna on a plate with dipping sauce</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/tuna-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/tuna-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tuna-80.jpg</name><display-name>tuna-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22925</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Seared tuna on a plate with dipping sauce</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing environmental criteria can get complicated for seafood consumers, but overall, U.S. tuna had a relatively low estimated carbon footprint.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new study published in </span><a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/9/1/00081/116726/Rethinking-sustainability-in-seafoodSynergies-and"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elementa</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz and NOAA examines traditional aspects of seafood sustainability alongside greenhouse gas emissions to better understand the &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; of U.S. tuna fisheries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisheries in the United States are among the best managed in the world, thanks to ongoing efforts to fish selectively, end overfishing, and rebuild fish stocks. But climate change could bring dramatic changes in the marine environment that threaten seafood productivity and sustainability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s one reason why researchers set out to broaden the conversation about sustainability in seafood by comparing the carbon emissions of different tuna fishing practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also puts those emissions in context relative to other sources of protein, like tofu, chicken, pork, or beef. In particular, the study examined how the carbon footprint of tuna was affected by how far from shore fishing fleets operated, or what type of fishing gear they used.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This can be an opportunity to look at fisheries from different angles, all of which may be important,&#8221; said Brandi McKuin, the study&#8217;s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, less selective tuna fishing gear&#8212;like purse seine nets that scoop up many tuna all at once&#8212;are more likely to accidentally catch other species during the fishing process. That&#8217;s called bycatch, and it&#8217;s a conservation concern that often factors into seafood sustainability assessments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But selective gear targeted more specifically for tuna, like trolling lines that reel fish in one at a time, typically have a higher carbon footprint, according to the study&#8217;s estimates. That&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because fishing vessels using these methods had to travel greater distances or spend more time on the water to catch their allotment of fish, which meant they used more fuel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one example, skipjack tuna had up to 12 times more estimated climate forcing when produced with trolling gear rather than purse seine gear. Skipjack from purse seine fleets had an estimated carbon footprint almost low enough to compete with plant-based protein sources, like tofu, but this style of fishing can have relatively high bycatch. On the other hand, skipjack produced from trolling has almost no bycatch, but the study estimates its carbon footprint falls on the higher end of the protein spectrum, between pork and beef.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were other fishing methods that seemed to strike a balance. Albacore tuna caught on trolling and pole-and-line fishing gear by the North Pacific surface methods fleet had both negligible bycatch and relatively low estimated climate impacts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing bycatch, carbon footprints, and other environmental criteria can get complicated for seafood consumers, but overall, tuna had a relatively low estimated carbon footprint: less than or similar to that of chicken and lower than beef or pork, for most of the fishing methods studied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given recent headlines about how much carbon is unleashed by commercial fishing activities, it&#8217;s important to have a rigorous, peer-reviewed data analysis which demonstrates the carbon footprint of tuna fishing activities is favorably low compared to many land-based food protein production alternatives,&#8221; said Stephen Stohs, a coauthor of the study who is a research economist at NOAA Fisheries&#8217; Southwest Fisheries Science Center.</span></p>
<h3>Advancing Seafood Sustainability</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study says consumers could choose to eat seafood with negligible bycatch impacts but a higher climate impact less often, just as some people choose to eat beef less often due to its climate impact. But the fishing industry may also be able to innovate in ways that would continue improving seafood sustainability on multiple fronts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seafood producers with lower carbon footprints can look for ways to further reduce their bycatch, while those with higher carbon footprints can work to improve their efficiency, whether in catching fish or using fuel. The study provides several policy recommendations to help fisheries reduce their carbon footprints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One idea discussed in the study is shifting fuel subsidies for fishing away from fossil fuels and toward investments in electrification technology and infrastructure, like hybrid electric and battery electric boat propulsion, as these options become more feasible. While this technology can&#8217;t yet support longer offshore trips, it already shows potential for coastal fleets. And support for electrification efforts could prioritize fleets using highly selective fishing gear.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea for lowering the carbon footprint of seafood is finding ways to offset emissions. But this strategy would first require a better understanding of emissions across the U.S. fishing sector. There are gaps in data about fuel use intensity for fishing vessels, which was a challenge even for the current study. But increased insight on emissions across the fishing sector could help with designing solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some within the fishing industry are already taking up this challenge. For example, the pollock industry in Alaska is setting an example by conducting a life cycle assessment to take a full inventory of their carbon footprint. Efforts like these have the potential to yield new sustainability benefits, and Brandi McKuin hopes more seafood producers will follow suit.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Companies are asking themselves, &#8216;What is our carbon footprint?&#8217; and that awareness can help them lead important change in the industry,&#8221; McKuin said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd40bf0c80727017480ce7266295719f"><name>banana-slug-share-sessions-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Inaugural Banana Slug Share sessions will add life and learning to Alumni Week</title><summary>The spirit of "paying it forward" infuses UC Santa Cruz’s inaugural Banana Slug Share Sessions, in which alumni will provide hard-won advice about everything from kombucha-making to the interpretation of dreams.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banana Slugs have a far-ranging curiosity and generous spirit. So it makes sense that an all-star group of Slug alumni would wish to share what they know in a series of informal &#8220;classes&#8221; during the upcoming </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all-virtual Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this year expanded from a weekend to a full week and set for April 19&#8211;25.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Oden-Petree, assistant director of Alumni Engagement at UC Santa Cruz, was overwhelmed by the outpouring of offers from alumni who wanted to take part in the Banana Slug Share Sessions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lmost 40 alumni raised their hands to share their passion, talent, and expertise with other alumni during this year's Alumni Week," she said. &#8220;When this idea first came up, we were hoping to find 6 to 12 alumni. The 20 alumni selected for the first-ever Banana Slug Share Sessions are creative, generous, fun, and skilled alumni who want to make a difference in the lives of others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unique Banana Slug Share Session, scheduled for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday, April 21, at 11 a.m.,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will feature </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/banana_slug_share_historical_glimpse_into_the_arts_at_ucsc_from_1975-77_student_film_documentary_video_synth_experiment#.YHSehhNKjOQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rare footage of UC Santa Cruz taken from 1975 and 1977</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of a &#8220;student film documentary and video synth experiment.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Their results, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01338-8">published April 15 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>, suggest that the initial atmospheres of terrestrial planets may differ significantly from many of the common assumptions used in theoretical models of planetary atmospheres.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information will be important when we start being able to observe exoplanet atmospheres with new telescopes and advanced instrumentation,&#8221; said first author Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The early atmospheres of rocky planets are thought to form mostly from gases released from the surface of the planet as a result of the intense heating during the accretion of planetary building blocks and later volcanic activity early in the planet&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the building blocks of a planet are coming together, the material is heated and gases are produced, and if the planet is large enough the gases will be retained as an atmosphere,&#8221; explained coauthor Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to simulate in the laboratory this very early process when a planet&#8217;s atmosphere is forming so we can put some experimental constraints on that story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed three meteorites of a type known as CM-type carbonaceous chondrites, which have a composition considered representative of the material from which the sun and planets formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;These meteorites are left over materials from the building blocks that went into forming the planets in our solar system,&#8221; Thompson said. &#8220;Chondrites are different from other types of meteorites in that they didn&#8217;t get hot enough to melt, so they have held onto some of the more primitive components that can tell us about the composition of the solar system around the time of planet formation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with materials scientists in the physics department, the researchers set up a furnace connected to a mass spectrometer and a vacuum system. As the meteorite samples were heated to 1200 degrees Celsius, the system analyzed the volatile gases produced from the minerals in the sample. Water vapor was the dominant gas, with significant amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and smaller amounts of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide gases also released.</p>
<p>According to Telus, models of planetary atmospheres often assume solar abundances&#8212;that is, a composition similar to the sun and therefore dominated by hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on outgassing from meteorites, however, you would expect water vapor to be the dominant gas, followed by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Using solar abundances is fine for large, Jupiter-size planets that acquire their atmospheres from the solar nebula, but smaller planets are thought to get their atmospheres more from outgassing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers compared their results with the predictions from chemical equilibrium models based on the composition of the meteorites. &#8220;Qualitatively, we get pretty similar results to what the chemical equilibrium models predict should be outgassed, but there are also some differences,&#8221; Thompson said. &#8220;You need experiments to see what actually happens in practice. We want to do this for a wide variety of meteorites to provide better constraints for the theoretical models of exoplanetary atmospheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other researchers have done heating experiments with meteorites, but those studies were for other purposes and used different methods. &#8220;A lot of people are interested in what happens when meteorites enter Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, so those kinds of studies were not done with this framework in mind to understand outgassing,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>
<p>The three meteorites analyzed for this study were the Murchison chondrite, which fell in Australia in 1969; Jbilet Winselwan, collected in Western Sahara in 2013; and Aguas Zarcas, which fell in Costa Rica in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may seem arbitrary to use meteorites from our solar system to understand exoplanets around other stars, but studies of other stars are finding that this type of material is actually pretty common around other stars,&#8221; Telus noted.</p>
<p>The investigation brought together researchers from three departments at UCSC: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Physics. In addition to Thompson and Telus, the coauthors of the paper include astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney and physicists Toyanath Joshi and David Lederman at UC Santa Cruz, and Laura Schaefer at Stanford University. This research was supported by NASA and the ARCS Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d164678180727017480ce7269361fd36"><name>daunte-wright-statement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on the tragic death of Daunte Wright</title><summary>We must continue to confront deeply embedded racism and how it continues to manifest itself in our systems and structures including policing policies and practices.</summary><start-date>1618383600000</start-date><display-name>Statement on the tragic death of Daunte Wright</display-name><path>/2021/04/daunte-wright-statement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/daunte-wright-statement</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1618420721505</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1618420721505</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is heartbreaking to write to our community about the tragic death of Daunte Wright in Minnesota.

<p>As more and more Californians receive the COVID-19 vaccination and the state eases restrictions around in-person activities, our campus has been exploring additional opportunities to celebrate our graduates.</p>
<p>As previously announced, we will hold virtual commencements this June to ensure that Banana Slugs near and far can celebrate their achievements and that families and friends around the world can participate. All of the details are available at our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618521918616000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJTQ639lXzRNRyBJEnVSnjqzd1bw" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a>. Degree conferral, congratulatory speeches, and the recognition of each graduate will all occur through the virtual commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p>In addition, we are planning a student-only, stage-crossing opportunity for graduates over a period of several days on the UC Santa Cruz campus &#8212; we&#8217;re calling it the Slug Crossing! In the coming weeks, graduates will be invited to sign up for a block of time during which they will have their name read, their photo taken and the opportunity to cross the commencement stage at an outdoor venue on campus. This event is for students only &#8212; family and friends are invited to watch via the livestream. This plan is evolving with a close eye on public health guidance and local, state, and UC health requirements, and may change if requirements change.</p>
<p>With the wide distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, many have asked why we cannot have an in-person ceremony. The progress of the pandemic continues to be difficult to predict however, and commencement ceremonies take months to plan and execute. The combination of a virtual commencement and a stage-crossing opportunity promotes well-being in our community and ensures that everyone, near and far, can join in the celebration.</p>
<p>To protect the safety of fellow students, as well as staff and volunteers, attendees will be required to wear face coverings (except during the stage crossing and photo) and maintain distance. Participants in the stage crossing must be fully vaccinated 14 days prior to the event or have a negative COVID-19 test result within 24-72 hours of the event. Details of how to confirm eligibility will be provided through the registration process.</p>
<p>I am grateful to everyone involved in supporting commencement for their hard work and creativity in finding new ways to celebrate our graduates and honor their achievements this year. We have faced so many challenges together over the past year and I look forward to celebrating the accomplishments of our students!</p>
<p>And if you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you request your gift box by <strong>11:59 p.m. April 15</strong>! The link to request a gift box is available on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618521918616000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZ5pJiR9NDWJbJ16xk5-RPg1peUQ" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a> .</p>

to receive 2021 Guggenheim Fellowship awards.</span></p>
<p><span>Film and digital media professor Irene Lusztig and art professor Elizabeth Stephens were among the 184 artists, writers, scholars, and scientists selected this year from nearly 3,000 applicants.</span></p>
<p><span>Since its establishment in 1925, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has granted nearly $400 million in Fellowships to over 18,000 individuals, among whom are more than 125 Nobel laureates, members of all the national academies, winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, Bancroft Prize, National Book Award, and other internationally recognized honors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I am thrilled to announce this new group of Guggenheim Fellows,&#8221; said Edward Hirsch, President of the Foundation, &#8220;especially since this has been a devastating year in so many ways. A Guggenheim Fellowship has always been meaningful, but this year we know it will be a lifeline for many of the new Fellows at a time of great hardship, a survival tool as well as a creative one.&#160;The work supported by the Fellowship will help us understand more deeply what we are enduring individually and collectively, and it is an honor for the Foundation to help the Fellows do what they were meant to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lusztig</strong> is a filmmaker, archival researcher, and visual artist. Her film and video work mines old images and technologies for new meanings in order to reframe and revive forgotten and neglected histories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I will be using the fellowship to continue my work on a feature length nonfiction film exploring the intertwined histories of the Hanford nuclear site and the city of Richland in Eastern Washington,&#8221; Lusztig noted.&#160;&#8220;I am interested in how communities think about their collective history, and how history shapes thoughts, habits, bodies, and physical landscapes.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Born in England to Romanian parents, Lusztig grew up in Boston and has lived in France, Italy, Romania, China, and Russia. Her work has been screened around the world in such venues as the Berlin International Film Festival, Museum of Modern Art, Film Society of Lincoln Center, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archive, IDFA Amsterdam, BFI London Film festival, and on television in the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of her work is centered on public feminism, language, and histories of women and women&#8217;s bodies&#8212;including her debut feature <i>Reconstruction</i> (2001), the archival film <i>The Motherhood Archives</i> (2013) her ongoing web-based <i>Worry Box Project</i> (2011) and her documentary feature film <i>Yours in Sisterhood</i> (2018).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Stephens</strong> is a multimedia artist, filmmaker, and professor with a Ph.D. in performance studies. She grew up in Appalachia, which has had a lasting influence on her work. After making visual and performance art about queer identity and other debates stemming from the culture wars in the 90s, Stephens left New York to join the faculty at UCSC. She founded the E.A.R.T.H. Lab (Environmental Art, Research, Theory, and Happenings) at UCSC "to make environmental art more sexy, fun, and diverse.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I will be using the Guggenheim to help produce my newest film, <i>Playing with Fire</i>,&#8221; said Stephens. &#8220;It will be an environmental justice documentary film with attendant social practice events that weave de/colonized, diverse narratives of climate change, gender/sexuality, and social justice into a kaleidoscopic narrative following the traumatic and transformative effects of fire on California's socio-political, community and ecological environments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Stephens received the Guggenheim in tandem with her collaborator, San Francisco filmmaker Annie Sprinkle. Their previous <a href="https://sprinklestephens.ucsc.edu">collaborations</a> include 22 large-scale performance art weddings to nature entities, such as marrying the Adriatic Sea at the 53rd Venice Biennale, and the film,&#160;<i>Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure</i>. They are also co-authors of a forthcoming book,<i> </i><a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/assuming-the-ecosexual-position"><i>Assuming the Ecosexual Position: Earth as Lover</i></a>, which will be published by University of Minnesota Press.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d6623e8f80727017480ce726185db138"><name>covid-testing-requirements</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Loosening of COVID-19 testing requirements</title><summary>We are now requiring only one test a week instead of two for students living, working or taking classes on campus.</summary><start-date>1618470000000</start-date><display-name>Loosening of COVID-19 testing requirements</display-name><path>/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1618504466032</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662576824288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>This is a moment to celebrate and for you to take a bow for helping to keep our community safe during this awful pandemic. Telecommuting, getting tested, supporting each other, and adhering to all the Slug Strong mitigation strategies have paid off. As a result of much improved regional public health conditions and low positivity rates amongst UCSC students and in Santa Cruz County, effective April 19, 2021 &#8212; we are </span><strong>now requiring only one test a week instead of two</strong><span> for students living, working or taking classes on campus. </span><strong>For student athletes, please note that you are still required to test at the cadence defined by the NCAA.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is a big deal! Our campus has consistently maintained a low positivity rate &#8212; one of the lowest in the UC system &#8212; because you have been so very supportive and respectful of our COVID mitigation measures. We&#8217;re not out of the woods yet, things can change on a dime, but there&#8217;s significant hope on the horizon. If we all keep getting tested, practicing social distancing, and wearing face coverings, we will get back to a new normal sooner rather than later.</span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Worksite plans</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Units across campus have been diligently completing worksite plans and readying buildings over the past year as operations have resumed on site.

The principal officers of any operation that plans to return in spring quarter but that does not yet have a completed worksite plan should complete the process outlined at the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/create-workplace-plan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618602356846000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3Lbd2s9qMTfrmrSYbk5ZmdqkXrQ" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/create-workplace-plan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Process for Resumption of On-Site Operations page</span></a><span>. As new guidance is released from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Cal OSHA, the requirements outlined in the worksite plan will be adapted.&#160; All facilities that have not completed worksite plans should do so (including all related mitigations) by June 1.

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Offices</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus has delegated authority to principal officers to determine what functions are deemed essential to be on site to support instruction, research and student support.&#160;</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beginning June 15, and over the months leading up to the start of fall quarter, units should begin to phase the return of employees who have not already returned to on-site work and formalize agreements with employees who have entered into or will enter into a routine telecommuting agreement as outlined in the telecommuting and remote work model </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/rolling-out-telecommuting-tools.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618602356846000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG40onRqItsYhFbZBUzW2pUU6w1gw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/rolling-out-telecommuting-tools.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>released in October</span></a><span>. If physical distancing guidelines remain in place, limitations on employee return will need to be factored into planning. Currently, the physical distancing guidelines remain at 6 feet (per CDC and CDPH); however, we anticipate updated guidance may be issued in the coming weeks, possibly reducing that to 3 feet or less. A framework will be provided to managers to assist in prioritizing and staging the return of these employees. This framework will include guidance on returning to spaces that have not been occupied for several months or, in some cases, over a year.&#160;</span></p>

The event will celebrate the </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/distinguished-grad-student-alumni/grad-alumni-award-2020.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/distinguished-grad-student-alumni/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> honorees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Studies Division Professional Development Coordinator and Event Organizer&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonya Newlyn had high praise for this year&#8217;s honorees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Their achievements range widely, reflecting the diversity of the divisions and programs they represent, but the theme of working for the common good, for a better world, runs through each of their stories and their work,&#8221; Newlyn said. &#8220;Each of them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">educates,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and their life work has continued the mission of UC Santa Cruz since they left this campus with their advanced degrees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five graduate alumni honorees and the academic divisions they represent include the following:</span></p>
<p><strong>Adrian Scott Centeno</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (M.A. &#8217;16, theater arts) rose to national prominence as a&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new play dramaturg, theater history and criticism lecturer, and arts education programmer after graduating from UC Santa Cruz.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before beginning his graduate studies at UC Santa Cruz, Centeno distinguished himself as a drama teacher, which informed his experience as a manager of Barnstorm, a student-run production company that was established in 2004.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centeno described the way the UC Santa Cruz community embraced him and made him comfortable during a crucial phase of his artistic career and personal development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I arrived as an outsider but was greeted as a friend by so many,&#8221; Centeno said. &#8220;That generosity of spirit was essential to the programming, management, and administration of the Barn Theatre.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnstorm helped Centeno thrive with its strong emphasis on inclusivity. He also dove deeply into strong scholarship. His thesis, focusing on the collaborative administration of the Barn space, remains an essential text for Barn managers to this day, giving them a blueprint to expand inclusivity, conflict resolution, and mediation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz taught me a lot about the importance of community,&#8221; Centeno said. &#8220;I try to carry that generosity, that solidarity, that DIY attitude with me in the field. We can do so much with so little when we work together. I love that about theater, and I love that about UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer, author, and academic</span><strong> Macarena G&#243;mez-Barris</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;04, sociology) praised the strength of cultural studies, environmental studies, Latina/o/x and Latin American studies, and feminist studies at UC Santa Cruz.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anti-racist and interdisciplinary-minded pedagogies across UC Santa Cruz allowed me to pursue my research and to take risks in my approach to the social sciences and humanities,&#8221; said G&#243;mez-Barris, professor and chairperson of Social Science and Cultural Studies at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">G&#243;mez-Barris is the founding director of the Global South Center (GSC), a research center that works at the intersection of social ecologies, art/politics, and decolonial methodologies at the Pratt Institute. Her instructional focus is on Latinx and Latin American studies, memory and the afterlives of violence, decolonial theory, the art of social protest, and queer femme epistemes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was an honor to be at UC Santa Cruz in the Ph.D. program of the Department of Sociology at the time I was there [1998-2004],&#8221; G&#243;mez-Barris said. &#8220;The focus in the department on the overlapping structures and intimacies of colonialism, race and identity, and structural inequality has continued to influence my work since I graduated 17 years ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the physical location left a lasting mark. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s beautiful coastal setting helped inspire </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Sea&#8217;s Edge, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">G&#243;mez-Barris&#8217;s upcoming book that reworks and builds on&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson&#8217;s environmental and marine legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Graduate Division has reason to be proud of its longstanding association with</span><strong> bell hooks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;83, literature), a brilliant writer, political theorist, and professor whose works are part of the intellectual canon.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For nearly four decades, hooks has written and published with clarity, novel insight, and extraordinary precision about art, media, race, gender, and class,&#8221; wrote the acclaimed and bestselling author Min Jin Lee in a detailed appreciation published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hooks is a celebrated feminist theorist, cultural critic, artist, and writer. Born Gloria Jean Watkins, bell hooks adopted the pen name of her maternal great-grandmother, and decided not to capitalize her new name to place focus on her work and not her identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has written over three dozen books and has published works that span several genres, including cultural criticism, personal memoirs, poetry collections, and children&#8217;s books. Her writings cover topics of gender, race, class, spirituality, teaching, and the significance of media in contemporary culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1981, hooks released the book A</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in&#8217;t I a Woman?: Black Women in Feminism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many view this as bell hooks&#8217; first major work and one of the key works of feminist thought in the postmodern milieu.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall of 2007, hooks drew a big crowd at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room when she gave a lecture called &#8220;What&#8217;s Love Got to Do With It? Ending Domination.&#8221; During the lecture, she mentioned the influence and impact of UC Santa Cruz:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was here as a graduate that I dared to dream beyond the fate that was designated for me as a Black woman,&#8221; hooks said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><strong>Rachel Karchin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;03, computer engineering), now a pioneering cancer researcher and professor of biomedical engineering, oncology, and computer science at Johns Hopkins University, was studying bioinformatics and computational biology at UC Santa Cruz, she was venturing into rarely explored terrain.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was something that most people at the time had never heard of,&#8221; Karchin said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karchin is grateful that UC Santa Cruz was a pioneer in her fields of interest.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The high energy and passion of the faculty and trainees working in computational biology convinced me that academia was the most exciting place to pursue a life in science,&#8221; Karchin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her experience at UC Santa Cruz has enriched and informed her career as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a computational biologist who is part of the high-tech front in the war against cancer. Her group develops algorithms and software to analyze genomic variation data, tumor evolution, and the adaptive immune system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no bioinformatics degree program when Karchin was at UC Santa Cruz, so she majored in computer science. Karchin worked with Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering David Haussler, now director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karchin and Haussler worked together on machine learning classification of protein families. She worked with Biomolecular Engineering Professor Kevin Karplus on protein structure modeling.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This was an exciting time to be on campus. After the UCSC team completed the assembly of the first human reference genome in 2000, the sense of potential of human genomics was off the charts,&#8221; Karchin said. &#8220;It was clear we were at the beginning of something of historical importance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the sequencing project, Karchin wanted to learn how human DNA variants related to disease, especially cancer, and thought that protein structure modeling could provide useful evidence for whether a mutation was disease related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johns Hopkins, Karchin&#8217;s lab has incorporated protein structure information into several machine learning methods that predict the impact of DNA variation, including methods that are specific for cancer-related variants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC also had an impact on my teaching philosophy&#8212;a de-emphasis on grades and the importance of project-based classes in engineering, plus the value of getting undergraduates started on research early in their careers,&#8221; Karchin said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Ian Walton </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. &#8217;77, mathematics),</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an independent educator, consultant, and former president of the statewide Academic Senate for the California community colleges system, came to UC Santa Cruz in 1973 as a Fulbright Scholarship graduate student in mathematics, after graduating from St. Andrews University in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walton said that his time in the graduate program gave him &#8220;the best possible preparation&#8221; for serving in the Academic Senate. While on campus, he served as graduate student resident preceptor at Crown College, &#8220;leading an independent, articulate group of peers,&#8221; he recalled.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also credits his years at UC Santa Cruz with providing &#8220;the perfect mix of introductions for&#8221; his later career: research and teaching in his graduate program with the Math Board that included technology and under-served students, and peer leadership as a resident preceptor at Crown College. He also received &#8220;a glimpse of the intricacies of academic politics&#8221; while serving on the Regent&#8217;s Chancellor Selection Committee for UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1978 he began a 33-year career as a faculty member at Mission College (then Silicon Valley&#8217;s newest public community college) that focused on helping California&#8217;s most under-served students to overcome barriers to their dreams that were posed by mathematics requirements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His educational leadership experience led to five years as president of his local Academic Senate, followed by 12 years elected to the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges (ASCCC), representing California&#8217;s 115 accredited community colleges, 60,000 faculty, and 2.1 million students on academic and professional matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his two-year presidency of ASCCC, the organization helped to bring about the statewide adoption of enhanced English and mathematics graduation competencies and the creation of the system Basic Skills Initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After retirement in 2011, he continued his educational leadership and was elected as a public member of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC)&#8212;the body that accredits all two-year colleges in California, Hawaii, and the U.S. Pacific. Walton has just completed a two-year term as chair of the commission.</span></p>

I hope these updates are helpful and allow you to stay on top of what is happening as we move through the rest of this academic year and start eyeing the fall quarter. Hopefully then, campus life will resemble something closer to our lives pre-pandemic. My fingers are crossed that will be the case, and I&#8217;m sure yours are, too.</p>

</ul>
<h2>New campus resources open</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center&#8217;s long-awaited reopening is on the horizon. The center is poised to open &#8220;Seymour Center Outdoors!&#8221; on April 24. The new in-person outdoor education program features a variety of interpretative stations run by docents, allowing visitors to learn about favorite attractions like the blue-whale and gray-whale skeletons. The center has also opened registration for an in-person Ocean Explorers Summer Camp for children. The program and the camp are both detailed in a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/seymour-center-reopening.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2AvPUDhWA0gyli5DkEclKnhTgng" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/seymour-center-reopening.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">story on our campus newscenter</a>.</li>
<li>The campus Housing Portal has remained open throughout the fall, winter, and current spring quarter for students to apply for housing and to take care of other housing-related tasks. Know that we&#8217;ll soon be opening the housing application processes for both summer and the 2021-22 academic year housing. More information is <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/2021-22/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEi9-YGpc4TJCdcPTjfTIu0O4Lgwg" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/2021-22/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available online</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Governor announces reopening date</h2>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last week that California could lift most statewide COVID-19 restrictions by June 15 if the vaccine supply proves to be sufficient and hospitalizations remain low. This is obviously very encouraging news, but it&#8217;s important to point out the big caveats that come with the announcement &#8212; the need for continued low infection numbers and climbing vaccination rates. That means that we must all continue to do our part to curb this pandemic. Wear face coverings in public, continue to practice distancing, avoid large gatherings, and strongly consider getting vaccinated when a shot is made available to you.</p>
<p>The state changes would also mean some operational changes on our campus. Our Business and Administrative Services team <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/operations-spring-summer.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWulNGRP9ZeyI5gv0sGIMqhIo1UA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/operations-spring-summer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">put out a message earlier today</a> that offers guidance on the continued ramp-up of operations as we head into fall quarter &#8212; everything from when it is appropriate to return to offices to what travel restrictions remain in place. The message is chock-full of helpful information, so please take a look.</p>
<p>As a side note, there has been some confusion regarding paid sick leave for employees dealing with COVID-19. A <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/memo_21-04-12.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZ_OCupHZfSKqjUAMhBZw3GxIOew" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/memo_21-04-12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message from our HR teams</a>went out to all staff and faculty earlier this week that seeks to clarify things, detailing a recent update to UC&#8217;s COVID-related leaves for employees. Hopefully it clears up any questions.</p>
<h2>Mandatory COVID testing reduced to once-weekly</h2>
<p>I would like to offer my gratitude to all on our campus &#8212; faculty, staff, and especially students &#8212; who have been doing their part to keep our community safe during this pandemic. Learning or working from home, getting tested regularly, adhering to the many safety measures we have in place &#8212; these are not the most enjoyable rules to follow, but your efforts have paid off! As a result of the low infection rates we are seeing in our campus testing program and in the greater Santa Cruz community, we are changing our asymptomatic testing protocol, reducing the testing requirements for students living, working or taking classes on campus from two tests per week to only one. The new protocol is laid out in detail <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNYrTWBVoVXn8_XpH1xmbevDsXdw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a message to students</a> that went out this morning. Thank you all for helping keep our community safe.</p>
<h2>Vaccine eligibility expanded</h2>
<p>All Californians 16 and older are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine beginning today, April 15. Remember, however, that eligibility and availability are two different things. Even with expanded vaccine supplies, it is expected to take several months for all willing Californians to be vaccinated. The best way to ensure you&#8217;re in line for a shot is to sign up at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuxhyYnMOrbMPxBo_wlamDR6tStQ" href="http://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MyTurn.ca.gov</a> . The site is adding appointments regularly, and is a great one-stop shop for all things COVID.</p>
<h2>Protecting your personal and financial information</h2>
<p>Like several hundred other institutions throughout the country, UC is working to protect its community after a data breach involving the service provider Accellion. The cybersecurity attack is a reminder of the importance of doing everything possible to protect ourselves online. It&#8217;s more important than ever to follow best practices for cybersecurity whether you&#8217;re at home or in the office. Our campus has a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/protect-your-data.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcyVJEyOp6L0UgNz5OpOGOxqV3mA" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/protect-your-data.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cybersecurity webpage</a> that details how to protect your data. Please visit the site when you have a chance!</p>
<h2>Slug family growing by the day</h2>
<p>This time of year is celebratory for a host of reasons, not the least of which is we get to salute a new class of students who are choosing to accept our offers of admission. Right now, our Banana Slug family is growing by about 100 Slugs a day, which is much faster than what occurs in the wild! That number will jump even higher as we approach the acceptance deadlines: May 1 for first-year students and June 1 for transfers. All told we expect about 3,900 new first-year students and 1,700 transfer Slugs over the summer and fall. Each brings unique perspectives and talents to our community, combined with a passion for making a difference &#8212; the hallmark of all Banana Slugs!</p>
<h2>Celebrate commencement with a special Slug crossing!</h2>
<p>Virtual commencements are planned for June to ensure Slugs near and far can celebrate their achievements with families and friends. All of the details are available at our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQbMpuqdCf7ARucb9Rf1LujH6jcg" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a> . In addition, we are planning a student-only stage-crossing opportunity for graduates over a period of several days. In the coming weeks, graduates will be invited to sign up for a block of time during which they will have their name read, their photo taken and the opportunity to cross the commencement stage at an outdoor venue on campus. I am excited that we can do this for our students.</p>
<h2>No matter where you are &#8230;</h2>
<p>On campus or not, you can still access campus resources, engage with other Slugs, and stay connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our alumni celebration is virtual this year, which allows Slugs far and wide to reconnect and celebrate a lifelong connection to UC Santa Cruz. We have a host of virtual events on tap that will interest alumni as well as current students, faculty and staff. Check out the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618610875247000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQTqTBIVGQ62uNnnEoXohsw14Cmw" href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alumni Week website</a> for the full lineup!</li>
<li>An important email invite will be landing in your inbox a week from today, April 22. Please be on the lookout. A year ago, UC San Diego conducted a survey for our campus to assess your early experiences in the pandemic and how we could best address your needs. Feedback from more than 1,500 respondents helped inform our recovery efforts. As we ready ourselves for the next stages of our recovery and the continued ramp up of on-site activities, we are reaching out again for your input. Please take the time to share your perspectives.

Throughout her career, McCullough has been an advocate for women&#8217;s leadership at the highest levels. She&#8217;ll join Professor Chris Benner, director of the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation, for a conversation on April 24th, from 5:30&#8211;7 p.m.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough will also be presented with the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award. This event will be held in memory of Gabe Zimmerman (Stevenson &#8216;02, sociology). <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/a_conversation_with_terri_mccullough_oakes_90_politics_chief_of_staff_to_nancy_pelosi_in_memory_of_gabe_zimmerman_stevenson_02_sociology#.YHnIFRNKiAO">Registration</a> is free and open to the public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, McCullough connected with the UC Santa Cruz news team to discuss her career, sources of inspiration, and Banana Slug pride.&#160;</span></p>
<h3>A calling for public service</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terri McCullough vividly remembers the moment she knew she had to change careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was working for a software company in Santa Cruz, and we were all listening to the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings," she said, referring to Anita Hill's galvanizing 1991 testimony that the Supreme Court nominee had sexually harassed her years earlier. "I was stunned that no one on the committee was listening to a woman as intelligent, respected, brave&#8212;as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">courageous</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;as Professor Anita Hill."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough recalls the make-up of the Senate committee. "I felt so strongly that I wanted to find a way to ensure there were a lot of different faces at those seats of power. It was a revelatory moment."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's when McCullough dedicated herself to changing the system by getting more women at the table. Over her career, she has worked for and with some of the most influential women in the country, including Hillary Clinton, Cecile Richards, Tory Burch, and Anna Deavere Smith.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it all began with California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, with whom she interned in 1991. She moved up to serve as a legislative assistant in Pelosi's Washington D.C. office, then was an adviser in her outreach office, and finally ran Pelosi's personal office until 2011. "I knew I wanted to work for a woman in Congress," said McCullough. "She has been amazing from the time I met her."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi, now Speaker of the House of Representatives, reached out to McCullough to return to the Hill as chief of staff, making McCullough the first woman to serve in that role in a paid, full-time capacity. Her first day on the job was March 25, 2019. No two days since have been the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There's always something different," said McCullough, 50. "I'm not sitting at a desk or a computer much. There's a lot of people asking questions and connecting people, whether I'm helping solve small problems or solving something big."&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Women&#8217;s leadership in the nation&#8217;s capital</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast pace isn't new for McCullough, who says she feels very fortunate to have worked for so many "talented, driven, powerful women."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough worked directly with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton as CEO of No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a gender-equity program of the Clinton Foundation. Her career includes stints as the executive director of the Tory Burch Foundation, which supports women entrepreneurs around the world, and she worked with Anna Deavere Smith's Institute on Arts and Civic Dialogue at New York University. She considers former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards a family friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I wish I were not that unusual," she said of her professional affiliation with women leaders. "I wish it weren't so extraordinary that just about every experience I've had has been working for women. I don't know anything else."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity to support Pelosi&#8212;McCullough succeeds Daniel Weiss (Rachel Carson College '85, sociology), another UC Santa Cruz alum and longtime legislative staffer, who led Pelosi's team during the congresswoman's effort to win back the House in November 2018&#8212;necessitated her family's move from New York City back to the nation's capital. She and her husband, political consultant Howard Wolfson, have a daughter and son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's always been important for me to be a part of making systemic change, particularly for women and families," said McCullough. "We are at such a critical moment now to create change for people who have not been represented. People with real economic need. People who need better health care. People who need a bigger paycheck."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 were a bruising reminder that more change is needed. "We've made progress, but not enough," she said. "I keep that in mind every day."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, McCullough has felt energized by seeing record numbers of women elected to Congress. There&#8217;s also increasing representation in other powerful public offices, like Kamala Harris&#8217;s election as Vice President.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What makes this moment so thrilling is the number of women fighting for systemic and cultural change," she said. "We are on the cusp of making real change. The power of unity, of us working together, is mesmerizing to consider."</span></p>
<h3>An awakening at UC Santa Cruz</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the daughter of a letter carrier whose pension provided vital family support, and as a first-generation college graduate who received federal financial aid, McCullough has a keen appreciation for the role of government in people's everyday lives. She also has legions of admirers, including fellow Banana Slug Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics), who runs a strategic communications firm in San Francisco.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clemens credits McCullough with mentoring a generation of political staffers in the Bay Area and Washington, D.C., imbuing in them the ability to anticipate, plan, organize, and know the answers to questions before they are asked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Terri's work to elevate women is legendary," he said. "She's</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been the behind-the-scenes catalyst that has led to headlines, policy shifts, and actual societal change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough chose UC Santa Cruz because she felt "an alignment with the philosophy and ethos of the university."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I will never be able to explain the incredible impact my experience at Oakes had on me. To meet so many different people from so many life experiences was an awakening," said McCullough, who was raised in San Rafael.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake brought the Oakes community together under trying circumstances. McCullough, a neighborhood assistant that year, recalled the responsibility she felt for her fellow students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We slept on the big grassy field behind Oakes that night, because we were all so worried about aftershocks. We were so afraid," she said. "It forged a bond with so many of us. We all relied on each other so deeply."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough took a range of classes and dabbled in acting before she discovered the Politics Department. "Dan Wirls's U.S. politics class was the jumping off point for me," she recalled. "He taught in a really insightful way." Then, laughing, she added: "Of course, there's academic exposure, and the actual exposure here in Washington, and the one never really prepares you for the other."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, her years on campus made more than lasting memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Santa Cruz is the place where I learned about building coalitions and building communities," she said. "That is something I'll never forget. The power of building community has informed everything."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dc924eb280727017480ce726f6fd8568"><name>nagpra-awareness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Interim Policy</title><summary>I write to raise awareness of new policy requirements, affirm the campus’s commitment to the guiding principles and procedures, provide mechanisms to report if you believe you or others may hold Native American or Native Hawaiian human remains or cultural items, and enlist your assistance ensuring the campus fully complies with this important human rights policy. </summary><start-date>1618815600000</start-date><display-name>Update on Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Interim Policy</display-name><path>/2021/04/nagpra-awareness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/nagpra-awareness</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1618608279186</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1618608279186</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) issued the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-policy-analysis-coordination/policies-guidance/curation-and-repatriation/index.html">Native American Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Interim Policy</a> on July 24, 2020 to clarify the process by which all UC campuses will implement the Federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and California NAGPRA (CalNAGPRA). NAGPRA protects Native American graves and requires repatriation of Native American human remains and certain cultural items (funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony). Repatriation is the process of returning Native American ancestral human remains and certain cultural items to their indigenous communities. UC Santa Cruz is fully committed to the goal of repatriation as well as implementation of this policy and relevant laws. The Interim Policy substantially revised the previous policy to promote the repatriation of Native American human remains and cultural items, and to increase accountability and transparency across all UC campuses.</p>
<p>I write to raise awareness of new policy requirements, affirm the campus&#8217;s commitment to the guiding principles and procedures, provide mechanisms to report if you believe you or others may hold Native American or Native Hawaiian human remains or cultural items, and enlist your assistance ensuring the campus fully complies with this important human rights policy. In particular, I want to draw your attention to the following significant elements of the new policy, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articulates principles that the repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains is a fundamental objective and value of the university.</li>
<li>Requires campuses to proactively review existing collections or other holdings that may potentially contain Native American or Native Hawaiian human remains or cultural items.</li>
<li>Prohibits the use of Native American or Native Hawaiian human remains or cultural items in research or instruction activities without tribal approval.</li>
<li>Requires the university to consult with tribes regarding traditional care practices.</li>
<li>Provides mechanisms for tribes to file appeals and complaints if they disagree with campus actions or decisions under the policy.</li>
<li>Provides a mechanism for members of the campus community to report Native American human remains and cultural items that are not being properly maintained or properly reported.</li>
<li>Requires each campus to perform a review of all departments and units historically engaged in studies with human remains or cultural items and all departments or units identified by department deans, chairs, or unit heads as potentially holding human remains or cultural items, in order to identify previously unreported human remains or cultural items.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Chancellor&#8217;s Designee under the Interim Policy, I am responsible for campus oversight, compliance, and decision-making associated with this policy, NAGPRA, and CalNAGPRA. Jon Daehnke (jdaehnke@ucsc.edu) serves as the NAGPRA Point of Contact for the campus under the policy and has been delegated authority to implement this policy. As we prepare for the campus-wide review described above, I will be writing to department deans, chairs, and unit heads with further instruction in the coming weeks. I kindly request the cooperation of all UC faculty, staff, and students with the NAGPRA Point of Contact and their department heads as needed in carrying out this review.</p>
<p>For updated information regarding the Policy, including a current distribution of a new draft to move the policy from interim to final, please visit <a href="https://ucal.us/nagpra">https://ucal.us/nagpra</a>. Please contact Jon Daehnke (jdaehnke@ucsc.edu) or the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/compliance/services/nagpra.html">Office of Research Compliance Administration</a> at lestanol@ucsc.edu or (831) 459&#8211;4114 with any questions regarding the policy or if you believe you or others may hold Native American or Native Hawaiian human remains or cultural items. We appreciate your attention and full cooperation with this policy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Vice Chancellor Scott Brandt, Office of Research</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dc92d75180727017480ce726da61ddf7"><name>costa-smm-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>IMS Director Dan Costa named a fellow of the Society for Marine Mammalogy</title><summary>Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been honored by the Society of Marine Mammalogy (SMM) in its inaugural class of SMM Fellows.</summary><start-date>1618556400000</start-date><display-name>IMS Director Dan Costa named a fellow of the Society for Marine Mammalogy</display-name><path>/2021/04/costa-smm-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/costa-smm-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1618608314157</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1618608463542</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/dan-costa-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/dan-costa-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dan-costa-350.jpg</name><display-name>dan-costa-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>76551</file-size><width>350</width><height>404</height></image><image-alt>Daniel Costa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/dan-costa-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/dan-costa-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dan-costa-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>dan-costa-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21903</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Daniel Costa</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Daniel Costa</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> at UC Santa Cruz, has been honored by the <a href="https://marinemammalscience.org/">Society of Marine Mammalogy</a> (SMM) in its inaugural class of SMM Fellows.</p>
<p>Costa was recognized &#8220;for pioneering work in field physiology, biologging development, and global syntheses, and for training the next generation of marine mammalogists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new &#8220;Fellows&#8221; designation was created to recognize SMM members who have &#8220;rendered conspicuous service or made truly notable contributions to the advancement and diffusion of the knowledge of marine mammal science or the fostering of its practical applications through conservation of marine mammals.&#8221;</p>

<p><span>All proceeds will benefit the newly established Danny Scheie Scholarship Fund, which will provide an annual grant to selected UCSC theater students to help launch their performing arts careers.</span></p>
<p><span>Scheie himself will star as the Dromio twins, along with a cast drawn from his 1988 signature production, including talented student and professional actors that he has collaborated with throughout his career.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The student alumni inspired me to do this event,&#8221; Scheie noted.&#160;&#8220;One of my former students when I first got here was Kevin Beggs, who assisted me on several shows, and who is now the chairman of Lionsgate Television. A bunch of LA slugs got together and pitched the idea to the Division of the Arts. I was incredibly honored.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Beggs is set to emcee the event along with Rachel Goslins, another notable UCSC alumnus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Rachel was working for Michelle Obama in the White House when I placed a student with her as an intern--Giles Henderson, who will appear briefly in the evening as well--during a quarter at UCDC with a bunch of theater slugs,&#8221; said Scheie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And Michael Edwards, the artistic director of the Asolo Theater in Florida, will kick off the event.&#160;He hired me in my first play in Santa Cruz, gave me my first professional directing job here, and was an incredible mentor and shaping force in my life and my career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Some of the original cast of the 1988 production of <i>Comedy of Errors</i> will be returning, many of them former students,&#8221; Scheie added.&#160;&#8220;Some other alumni from over the years, as well as current students, alongside some of my favorite actors from my professional world, will all be acting together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Scheie recalled how he ended up teaching at the UC Santa Cruz campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I joined the UCSC faculty as a lecturer in 1987. It was after my second season as an actor with Shakespeare Santa Cruz.&#160;I was writing my dissertation at UC Berkeley, and had been teaching there&#8212;I jumped at the change.&#160;Then I joined the permanent&#160;faculty in 1991-92, after I had been directing for Shakespeare Santa Cruz for several seasons.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Although he is retiring</strong> from UC Santa Cruz, Scheie is not retiring from acting. And he definitely has some solid plans for the future.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I want to continue acting until I drop dead onstage, hopefully in a comedy&#8221; said Scheie. "I also want to continue traveling with my husband, all over the world, as we have been doing while teaching and acting. I want to become fluent in Mandarin, Spanish, and Norwegian.</span></p>
<p><span>I also get to watch baseball as much as I want,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span>Described just this past week by the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> as &#8220;quite possibly the Bay Area&#8217;s leading interpreter of comedic stage roles,&#8221; Scheie has won numerous honors over the years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2017, he received an award from The San Francisco Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle in the category of best featured actor for his role in George Bernard Shaw&#8217;s comedy, <i>You Never Can Tell</i>, at California Shakespeare Theater.</span></p>
<p><span>He previously won Bay Area Critics Circle awards as leading actor for <i>The Last Hairdresser</i> at Theater Rhinoceros in 1997, <i>You Nero</i> at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2010, and <i>Last Fall</i> at San Jose Repertory Theatre in 2013.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Scheie also won as best supporting actor for a world premiere Lanford Wilson piece at the Magic Theater in 1996, and as director for <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> at Aurora Theater in 1999.</span></p>

Feild/STScI)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>COSMOS-Webb is slated to be the largest program in JWST’s first year of operation</article-subhead><article-text><p>When the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) becomes operational in 2022, one of its first orders of business will be mapping the earliest structures of the universe. A team of nearly 50 researchers, including UC Santa Cruz astronomers Brant Robertson and Nicole Drakos, will attempt to do this through the COSMOS-Webb program, the largest general observer program selected for JWST&#8217;s first year.</p>
<p>Over the course of 208.6 observing hours, the COSMOS-Webb program will conduct an ambitious survey of half a million galaxies with multi-band, high-resolution near infrared imaging and an unprecedented 32,000 galaxies in mid infrared. Led by scientists at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and University of Texas at Austin, the COSMOS-Webb program will rapidly release data to the public so it can lead to countless other studies by other researchers.</p>
<p>The COSMOS field was originally imaged by the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) project using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and additional observations have been made in the COSMOS field with a variety of other telescopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;COSMOS is one of the premier fields in extragalactic astronomy, the largest contiguous field ever imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope, but there&#8217;s a huge undiscovered space in COSMOS that has not yet been exploited in infrared,&#8221; explained Robertson, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;JWST observes in infrared wavelengths, and it&#8217;s very sensitive because it has a larger mirror than HST. By going further into the infrared, we can see galaxies at higher redshifts, which means further back in time, and because it is so sensitive we can see smaller and fainter galaxies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheer scope of our program is so exciting,&#8221; said principal investigator Jeyhan Kartaltepe at RIT&#8217;s School of Physics and Astronomy. &#8220;The first year of Webb observations will result in a lot of new discoveries that people will want explore more in-depth in future cycles. I think the public legacy of COSMOS-Webb will be that COSMOS will be the field where the community conducts this type of follow-up research.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey will map 0.6 square degrees of the sky&#8212;about the area of three full moons&#8212;using JWST&#8217;s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instrument, while simultaneously mapping a smaller area of 0.2 square degrees with the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Through this approach, the scientists hope to achieve three main goals.</p>
<p>The first goal focuses on the epoch of reionization, which took place from 400,000 to 1 billion years after the big bang. When the first stars and galaxies formed, they provided energy to re-ionize the early universe, and it likely happened in little pockets, not all at once. COSMOS-Webb aims to map out the scale of these reionization bubbles.</p>
<p>A second goal is to use the MIRI instrument to look for fully evolved galaxies at high redshifts that seemingly matured soon after the universe formed. HST has found examples of these galaxies, which challenge existing models about how the universe formed, so the hope is to find more examples of these high redshift galaxies and study them in more detail to understand how they could have evolved so rapidly.</p>
<p>The third primary objective makes use of a technique called weak lensing. Because gravity is sensitive to all kinds of matter, including invisible dark matter, scientists can use the distortions of light around galaxies to estimate of the amount of dark matter. COSMOS-Webb will provide important insight about how dark matter in galaxies has evolved with the stellar content of galaxies over the age of the universe.</p>
<p>Drakos, a postdoctoral scholar working with Robertson at UCSC, played a crucial role in the planning for COSMOS-Webb, using cosmological simulations to predict what JWST would see at different distances. Those predictions showed how JWST can be used to map the distribution of galaxies in the early universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re interested in looking at the emergence of large-scale structure in the early universe and the distribution of galaxies during reionization, and Dr. Drakos&#8217;s calculations showed how to find those high-redshift structures,&#8221; Robertson said.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Caitlin Casey at UT Austin said, &#8220;COSMOS-Webb has the potential to be groundbreaking in ways we haven&#8217;t even dreamt yet. You don&#8217;t know what treasures are there to find until you use an incredible telescope like Webb to stare at the sky for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>COSMOS-Webb is one of just 286 <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-james-webb-space-telescope-general-observer-scientific-programs-selected">General Scientific Observer programs selected</a> out of more than 1,000 proposals for the telescope&#8217;s first year of science, known as Cycle 1. These specific programs will provide the worldwide astronomical community with one of the first extensive opportunities to investigate scientific targets with Webb. NASA is currently targeting October 31, 2021, for JWST&#8217;s launch.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/initiatives/fellows-academy/index.html">EVC Fellows Academy 2.0</a> is a program for associate professors that provides a mutual accountability framework for faculty to make progress on their writing projects.</p>
<p>Writing Fellows is a program for assistant professors that uses a peer support model supplemented by targeted mentoring from an associate professor. Both of these are open to faculty at any stage of writing, broadly construed, including books, articles, films, and other research and creative projects that can benefit from a group feedback structure.</p>
<p>The application deadline for the EVC Fellows Academy is Friday, April 23. The <a href="https://forms.gle/aGWpeJMK2co1WSqJ8">Writing Fellows application portal</a> is open and applications will be due Monday, May 3, 2021.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ebe47bb580727017480ce726bc3dea54"><name>artwork-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New interim Interior Artwork Installations policy</title><summary>To support the existing processes surrounding the installation of artworks in common areas, the Interior Artwork Installations policy will be implemented on an interim basis. </summary><start-date>1618556400000</start-date><display-name> New interim interior artwork installations policy</display-name><path>/2021/04/artwork-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/artwork-policy</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1618865322902</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1618865322902</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>To support the existing processes surrounding the installation of artworks in common areas, the&#160;</span><a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/evc/evc002.art.pdf"><span>Interior Artwork Installations policy</span></a><span>&#160;will be implemented on an interim basis.</span></p>

<p>Project REAL (Redesigning for Equity and Advancing Learning) has been funded by the Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>The 2021 Summer cohort of 12&#8211;15 faculty will run from June 21 to July 23. Participants will receive $5,000 in Summer funds. CITL is particularly seeking interested faculty teaching gateway or critical major pathway courses in any STEM field.</p>
<p>Developed by CITL in partnership with Hispanic-Serving Institution Initiatives, Institutional Research, Assessment and Policy Studies, and selected STEM faculty, Project REAL is designed to provide faculty with a research-based program to engage in comprehensive equity-minded course redesign to improve teaching and learning and contribute to equitable outcomes for students at UC Santa Cruz. The time commitment is approximately 8&#8211;10 hours per week for five weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitated and closely supported opportunity to redesign a course. Facilitators for 2020&#8211;21 are Robin Dunkin, Nandini Bhattacharya, and Noori Chai.</li>
<li>For key courses in the undergraduate curriculum&#8211;beginning with STEM &#8220;gateway&#8221; courses known to be barriers to student persistence in STEM majors.</li>
<li>Opportunity for individual faculty or for cohorts of faculty who participate as a team to make connections between sequential courses and/or address curricular coherence within and across major pathways. Teams of faculty could be those who teach the same course or those who teach courses in a fixed sequence within the major.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgb_MgUyY1Uxy-V_ZpHMi6UDc9tHR4mmfdz6mM5dGsBdlI-Q/viewform">Applications</a> for individuals and teams are due by 10 am on May 3, 2021.

<p>As many of you know, UCSD in April 2020 conducted a survey for our campus to assess your early experiences in the pandemic and how we could best address your needs as many of you shifted to working from home. At that point, we did not know what the path ahead would look like. Feedback from more than 1,500 respondents helped inform our recovery efforts and our approach to operations, guiding us as we rolled out campus <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-employees/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618950998087000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwTyFh24Cr3su4ePx9Hk1t1p82pg" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-employees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support programs</a> and communications.</p>
<p>In the past year, you have demonstrated resilience as well as dedication to our mission, our students, and each other. As we prepare for the next stages of our recovery efforts and the continued ramp-up of on-site activities leading up to the start of the next academic year, we are again participating in the UC San Diego COVID-19 survey.</p>
<p>Most of the survey questions are the same as last time to give us the opportunity to see how we have done in the past year &#8212; where we have improved and where we need to focus our efforts. In addition, we will be able to see how we have performed in comparison to other campuses participating in the UC San Diego assessment. I hope you will, once again, take the time to share your perspectives.</p>
<p>The survey will be sent to you from <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tritonlytics.ucsd.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618950998087000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdB3HJg1W3bgqj5tGVadmrerTKZw" href="https://tritonlytics.ucsd.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tritonlytics</a>, which is the assessment unit at UC San Diego. Invites will go out on April 22. The survey is short, and should take about five minutes to complete. The survey is confidential, and your name will not be associated with your responses</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for sharing your perspectives.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

planning at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, came to reproductive health work from a steadfast commitment—strengthened by her time at UC Santa Cruz—to feminism, gender equality, and women’s empowerment
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Starrs is in the middle of her &#8220;quiet week,&#8221; a time to step aside from her busy schedule as director of family planning at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recharge. Yet, here she is on the phone talking enthusiastically about the new family planning strategy being undertaken by the foundation, about the importance of scientific data in policy- and decision-making, and the role of family planning in women&#8217;s empowerment.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was in an airport the other day and I passed by a shop and saw all these books about self-care, and I thought, &#8216;Yeah, that&#8217;s not my strong suit,&#8217;&#8221; Starrs says with a laugh after it&#8217;s pointed out that she scheduled this work-related interview during her so-called quiet week. &#8220;I&#8217;m very much about getting the work done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starrs has been getting the work done ever since she graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1984 with a degree in politics and a minor in economics. The Merrill College grad spent 25 years at Family Care International, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for women around the world, the last five years as CEO. Then, for four years, she was president of the Guttmacher Institute, which researches issues around sexual and reproductive rights. In July 2019, she landed the top family planning job at the Gates Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came to reproductive health work from a really strong commitment to feminism, to gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment,&#8221; Starrs says. &#8220;It&#8217;s the belief that every girl and woman should be able to fulfill their potential.&#8221; Which means access to education, to economic opportunity, and the ability to prevent unintended or unwanted pregnancies and go through childbirth safely and in good health, she says.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Committing to an activist position</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her path to this belief is rooted not only in her childhood, but also in her time at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starrs&#8217;s father was a foreign service officer, and she spent most of her childhood living in Spanish-speaking countries like Spain, Mexico, and Guatemala.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew I was an American citizen, but I had much more of a global identity,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending three semesters at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, she transferred to UC Santa Cruz when her whole family moved west. She joined </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">City on a Hill Press</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and found herself shifting from a focus based primarily on academics to one of social justice, feminism, and activism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz is what woke me up and engendered in me a commitment to a much more activist position,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wanted to do what I could to make the world a better place.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help today's students get the same kind of activist education, Starrs has contributed to various programs that reflect her own experiences and values, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">City on a Hill Press</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and campus writing enrichment programs. She has also directed significant gifts recently to the UCSC Fund, which allows administrators to direct funds where they are needed most and can have an immediate impact.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A game-changing commission</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence of her desire to make the world a better place runs throughout her career, including her time at the Guttmacher Institute, where Starrs created a commission on sexual and reproductive health and rights in partnership with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lancet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> medical journal. Made up of 16 experts from around the world, the group&#8217;s influential report laid out a series of evidence-based, essential, and affordable interventions to give people around the globe the right to make decisions about their bodies without coercion, stigma, or discrimination, according to Jonathan Wittenberg, executive vice president of the Guttmacher Institute in New York. The report still influences policy decisions around the world today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work of the game-changing commission, says Wittenberg, &#8220;speaks to Ann&#8217;s ability to shape, articulate, and execute a vision&#8221; while also building consensus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same approach she is taking at the Gates Foundation.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starrs talks excitedly of the organization&#8217;s updated family planning program, which has a budget of $280 million and was approved in January of this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focused primarily on India, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and, to a lesser extent, Kenya, Pakistan, and French-speaking West Africa, the strategy will fund programs that give women the opportunity to have more and better choices around pregnancy and family planning. Almost half of the initiative&#8217;s budget will go to contraceptive research and development along with market shaping&#8212;what the Gates Foundation excels at, says Starrs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&#8217;s concerns about the side effects of contraceptive methods, and the inconvenience of obtaining them, are major reasons women don&#8217;t use family planning even when they don&#8217;t want to have a child, Starrs says. As a result, the foundation&#8217;s strategy will fund research into things like a once-a-month oral contraceptive pill, a micro-array patch that delivers contraception through the skin, a self-administered injectable that will protect against pregnancy for three months, and even non-hormonal contraception methods that will make birth control more attractive and easier to obtain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By providing better options, we hope women will find a method that works for them,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s all anchored to a commitment to voluntary choice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodio Diallo, interim deputy director of Optimize FP Interventions at the Gates Foundation, says she was impressed not only by Starrs&#8217;s focus on data-driven evidence, but also by her collaborative approach. Speaking by phone from Nigeria, she says: &#8220;Ann would go across the foundation to build bridges and make sure we partner and complement each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Policy anchored to data</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Starrs what she&#8217;s most proud of in her career and she says it&#8217;s her focus on making science-based decisions and not relying on simple narratives that can lead to ineffective policy, especially on the sometimes hot-button topic of reproductive rights.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You want to have the change be what it needs to be. You need to anchor it to data,&#8221; she says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy makers must know the scope of the problem, the impact it has, and why it is happening before making decisions because perceptions can often be wrong, she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, it always comes back to enabling women and girls to achieve their potential, to manage their lives,&#8221; she says, &#8220;because having to go through an unintended or unwanted pregnancy can be a huge barrier to that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ann&#8217;s commitment to ensure there are expanded choices for women when it comes to contraception and letting women use their voices to make the decision that is right for them is very strong,&#8221; says Diallo.&#160; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f131883880727017480ce726c8c2e9c8"><name>chauvin-verdict</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on guilty verdict in Derek Chauvin case</title><summary>While I am relieved by and grateful for today’s verdict, it does not bring back George Floyd, a man who was clearly loved by many.

<p>What has unfolded in recent weeks &#8212; the senseless killing of Daunte Wright by police in Minnesota, the tragic death of 13-year-old Adam Toledo by law enforcement in Chicago &#8212; shows us how much more work still must be done to get to a more just, equitable society. America faces not only a pandemic, but a contagion of violence &#8212; mass shootings, a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, a public safety system that leaves many people feeling unsafe.</p>
<p>We must end this cycle. In the coming days and weeks, I hope we can come into conversation as a community on how best to work together to end systemic racism, to hold the system and individuals accountable for the killing of unarmed Black and brown individuals, and how to pursue equity, accountability and the reform of a judicial system that has a long history of unjust outcomes. Black lives matter on our campus and everywhere, and we must deliver that message unequivocally.</p>
<p>We will continue our efforts to implement policing approaches that build trust and earn the support of our community. We are moving deliberately and diligently forward on this front, and we will get there working together.</p>
<p>Despite this verdict, many in our community may be dealing with feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Do not hesitate to reach out to campus services for support. Staff in our colleges, <a href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu">resource centers</a>, and <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> provide assistance for students. The <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu">Division of Student Affairs and Success</a> is providing additional student programming over the coming days. Our <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a> offers counseling and support to employees.</p>
<p>George Floyd&#8217;s death was a senseless tragedy. Let us take this moment to learn from each other and unite as a community and country behind the need for equity, accountability, and broad systemic change.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cynthia Larive<br/>Chancellor, UC Santa Cruz</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-commends-chauvin-murder-trial-verdict</url><title>UC commends Chauvin murder trial verdict</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f5a04d4480727017480ce726a05f26eb"><name>institutional-challenge-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz and United Way partner to empower youth through research in local communities</title><summary>A research partnership between UC Santa Cruz and United Way of Santa Cruz County will offer local youth and UCSC undergraduates new leadership platforms and support college-readiness and success.</summary><start-date>1618988400000</start-date><display-name>New partnership with United Way</display-name><path>/2021/04/institutional-challenge-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/institutional-challenge-grant</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1619028626593</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1619549174470</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value><value>Sociology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/community_research2_4002.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/community_research2_4002.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>community_research2_4002.jpg</name><display-name>community_research2_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>71310</file-size><width>400</width><height>275</height></image><image-alt>A UC Santa Cruz student works with community members to collect data</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/community_research2_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/community_research2_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>community_research2_80.jpg</name><display-name>community_research2_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23378</file-size><width>80</width><height>73</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A UC Santa Cruz student works with community members to collect data</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>A new partnership between UC Santa Cruz and United Way&#160;will support community-engaged research and offer UCSC undergraduates and&#160;local youth leaders opportunities to study issues affecting health and wellbeing in surrounding communities.

Faculty and undergraduate students will partner with local high school and middle school students in Watsonville and Live Oak to design and implement community-engaged research projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work will provide new insight on youth education, health, and wellbeing initiatives and community services for immigrant and mixed-status families, unhoused families, and migrant working families. Local youth and UC Santa Cruz undergraduates who gain research experience through the program will have a new leadership platform to influence local policy. Also, the program is designed to support college-readiness and success, particularly for Latinx students who are or will be the first in their families to attend college.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding for this project comes from the highly-competitive, nationwide </span><a href="http://wtgrantfoundation.org/three-new-institutional-challenge-grants-to-encourage-partnerships-spur-community-engaged-research-and-reduce-inequality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional Challenge Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, supported by the William T. Grant Foundation, Spencer Foundation, and Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. These grants help universities and community organizations work together to reduce inequalities in youth outcomes. UC Santa Cruz, Johns Hopkins University, and Northeastern University were this year&#8217;s winners, while Cornell University received a continuation of funding.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Make no mistake, there were much larger institutions and larger agencies as finalists for this award,&#8221; said Keisha Browder, chief executive officer of United Way of Santa Cruz County. &#8220;For UC Santa Cruz and United Way to win this award affirms our ability to deepen and scale our work to improve youth outcomes.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Youth leadership through research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Browder will work alongside Associate Professor of Sociology Rebecca London and Professor of Psychology Regina Langhout to co-manage the new grant project, which kicks off in September. The first step will be a nine-month planning period including a workshop with undergraduates and youth leaders to develop a youth-driven research agenda.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s essential for young people to be the ones to ask important questions that create new knowledge,&#8221; Langhout said. &#8220;The research questions will be different when they come from the youth in the community. We really need to include youth voices, or we won&#8217;t be getting the full picture.&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the initial planning period, four cohorts of about 30 middle and high school students from United Way&#8217;s Youth Action Network will partner with similar cohorts of UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students to conduct research in the community. They&#8217;ll be guided by Langhout and three other faculty fellows: Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies Jessica Taft, Associate Professor of Sociology Steve McKay, and Assistant Professor of Psychology Saskias Casanova.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These fellows are phenomenal ambassadors for our work in the community,&#8221; said Rebecca London, the grant&#8217;s principal investigator. &#8220;They each have a lot they can share about ethical and actionable community-engaged research. I'm looking forward to working alongside them in the formation of this partnership, and I think the young people in our community will be really excited about it too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is also designed to position undergraduates as mentors for local youth. First-generation Latinx college students face inequalities in access to research opportunities, but new community-engaged research projects can help to close that gap while fostering meaningful connections with youth from similar backgrounds. The combined benefits of these relationships and research experiences could improve educational outcomes.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an opportunity to truly connect our youth to college students and the college experience,&#8221; Keisha Browder explained. &#8220;The sense of belonging builds their confidence for college and research. You see high school students walk with pride that they are doing this type of work. It gives us a chance to ignite that passion in a student and get them imagining who they could be once they step onto a college campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Building capacity for the future</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Emmert, Director of Community Impact at United Way of Santa Cruz County, will advise on the program&#8217;s research projects as a community fellow. Through this process, Emmert, a 2011 UCSC graduate, will learn new research methods and strategies for applying and disseminating findings throughout the community. The goal is to strengthen United Way&#8217;s role as a local leader in using research to inform practice for public service programs.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant will also give UC Santa Cruz an opportunity to build new internal structures and policies that will help advance the university&#8217;s impact in the community. With the support of the Office of Research, the project will develop ethics guidelines for community-based research and incorporate input from partners like United Way. The grant project will also recommend university-wide standards for how the value of community-engaged work is weighed in processes like tenure decisions and departmental reviews.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, UC Santa Cruz will create a new Campus + Community center to offer resources, support, and relationship-building that will connect university scholarship and research with the needs of community partners. The Campus + Community center will initially be housed within the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Social Transformation</a>, and Rebecca London will be the center&#8217;s inaugural faculty director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We're hoping to be a landing spot for the community so that it's easier for local organizations to access the expertise of researchers on campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are many folks on campus who really want to do work out in the community.

Her presentation will be followed by a panel discussion, including representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The session will then conclude with a special dialogue with 1993 Nobel Prize winner Sir Richard Roberts.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insights Kapuscinski will share during this session were informed in part by leading sustainability education programs at higher education institutions across the country, including </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/12/nasem-sustainability.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some at UC Santa Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The committee that produced the report visited UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Science Campus and toured the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems during their development process. The Coastal Science and Policy program was ultimately featured within the report as an example of how experiential learning can prepare the next generation of sustainability leaders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapuscinski and other members of the report&#8217;s development committee have been sharing their findings at conferences and events across the country, including the 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/kapuscinski-aaas2021-nas-sustainability-ed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year.

So when heavy winter rains triggered debris flows from the Dolan Fire burn scar, dumping tons of sediment onto the coastline, marine scientists at UC Santa Cruz found themselves leading a rescue operation.</p>
<p>Since early February, they have been digging out buried abalone, packing them in coolers, and taking them to a rehabilitation facility. Hundreds of abalone have been saved, but thousands were lost. The impact of these events on the overall population remains to be determined, said Peter Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, who is supervising the operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be catastrophic, because the bulk of the healthy black abalone population was in Big Sur,&#8221; Raimondi said. &#8220;We have thought of that area as a reservoir for potentially reestablishing black abalone in new areas, but if enough of them have been lost it will really compromise the ability of that population to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raimondi said he began to worry about the potential impacts of debris flows on the abalone well before the winter rains came. Several major fires in the coastal ranges&#8212;the Dolan, Carmel, and River Fires in Monterey County, and the CZU Lightning Complex north of Santa Cruz&#8212;burned watersheds that drain to critical areas of the coast for black abalone.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I looked at the maps of the fires, and Cal Fire and Cal Trans started putting out maps of potential debris flows, I could see they were aligned with where most of the remaining healthy populations of black abalone were,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>UCSC graduate student Wendy Bragg, who has been leading the rescue efforts in the field, said previous surveys of the black abalone population on the Big Sur coast enabled the researchers to identify places to focus their attention. Although she expected to see impacts, what she saw the first day was still a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some sites were impacted more than others, but where it was most severe it took us some time to reorient ourselves, because of the dramatic changes to the coastline,&#8221; Bragg said. &#8220;In some locations, we would notice the smell of things rotting before we even got there to start looking around.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debris flows were triggered by an &#8220;atmospheric river&#8221; event in January that dumped 15 inches of rain in three days on the Big Sur coast. A section of Highway 1 was washed out at Rat Creek, and a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/big-creek-flood.html">massive debris flow swept through the Landels-Hill Big Creek Natural Reserve</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just one rain event, but the amount of sediment that came down is huge,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Bragg said the team has mostly paused its rescue efforts for now, after two months of responding to new emergencies as shifting sediments affected sites that were not hit by the initial debris flows. The researchers are now working to identify suitable areas where they can safely return the roughly 200 black abalone that were rescued. The researchers will also continue to monitor the coastline while they begin to assess the overall impact on the black abalone population.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Sur coast is pretty inaccessible, so there are areas we haven&#8217;t seen yet,&#8221; Raimondi said. &#8220;We plan to start flying drones along the coast to assess those other areas, but at the sites we&#8217;ve been able to get to, the impacts are massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bragg estimated that in the areas they have been able to access, the losses of abalone are in the thousands. &#8220;If we extrapolate that to the whole area, it&#8217;s potentially tens of thousands, so the losses to the species overall could be catastrophic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black abalone population has already been hit hard by a disease known as withering syndrome, which caused mass mortalities in Southern California and has progressed up the coast as far as the southern end of Big Sur. That&#8217;s why the healthy population on the Big Sur coast is so important.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that black abalone will go extinct on the Big Sur coast because of this. It&#8217;s just that they will now have to recover locally before the population can spread and repopulate other areas,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Raimondi leads the <a href="https://marine.ucsc.edu/index.html">Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe)</a>, a consortium of organizations conducting long-term monitoring and biodiversity surveys along the Pacific Coast of North America. His team at UCSC includes a large number of scientists with expertise in coastal field surveys who were able to quickly shift to the abalone rescue operation. The UCSC team worked closely with state and federal agencies, including the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS).</p>
<p>&#8220;NMFS and CDFW were both very responsive in terms of permits and providing support, and we also got a lot of help from local landowners and volunteers in Big Sur,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>The threat of additional debris flows and landslides is likely to continue for several years, because the fires have destabilized the soil over large areas of the coastal mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cal Fire is telling us most of the debris is still up there, so a bunch more could come down,&#8221; Raimondi said. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a huge amount of sediment offshore now, and we&#8217;re not sure what&#8217;s going to happen with that. Normally, the sand moves offshore in winter and comes back onto the beaches starting around May, so we&#8217;ll keep monitoring and be ready to respond if we need to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of both wildfires and large storms, and their effects highlight the linkages between land and sea along the coast. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen something like this since I&#8217;ve been here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These massive winter storms coming after a fire can cause havoc in the ocean.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="00dca1c380727017480ce7262980c632"><name>covid-19-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Office of the President details COVID-19 vaccine policy</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President is proposing a policy that would make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus beginning in fall quarter 2021.</summary><start-date>1619074800000</start-date><display-name>Office of the President details COVID-19 vaccine policy</display-name><path>/2021/04/covid-19-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/covid-19-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1619217129886</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662576856494</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear campus community,</p>

<p>The proposal is a proactive public-health measure aimed at protecting members of the UC community &#8212; and the public at large &#8212; as students and employees transition from remote work and instruction back to the UC campuses. The California State University system is considering a similar policy.</p>
<p>UC is announcing the proposed policy before final review by various constituent groups to provide more time for students and employees to obtain the vaccine ahead of the fall term. UCOP is still establishing how it will accept feedback on the proposed policy. In the meantime, feel free to direct comments to <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pco@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619291697742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_ZNxapn2LmOqtTXTRKtCoR57MRA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention</a>, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are a safe and effective way to prevent the virus that to date has killed well over 550,000 Americans and over 3 million people worldwide.</p>

Should the policy be implemented, a process would be put in place for faculty, staff and students to request medical exemptions. Requests for disability or religious accommodations would be handled through existing campus policies and procedures.</p>
<p>All Californians 16 and older are now eligible to receive the vaccine. UC already strongly encourages students and employees to voluntarily obtain a vaccination as soon as possible. If the proposed policy is adopted following the review period and collective bargaining, the requirement would go into effect this fall, pending the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination gaining full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine is currently administered under Emergency Use Authorization.</p>
<p>Later this spring our campus will launch Arm in Arm, a vaccination-advocacy campaign aimed at communicating to our campus community the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine for a safe reopening of California and UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p><span>They are <strong>Angela Davis</strong>, distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies; <strong>James Estes</strong>, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology; and <strong>Barbara Rogoff</strong>, distinguished&#160;professor of psychology.</span></p>
<p><span>The three UCSC faculty are among 252 leaders in the sciences, arts, humanities, business, public affairs, and the nonprofit sector, who have been selected this year as fellows and foreign honorary members of the academy.</span></p>
<p><span>They join a diverse group of extraordinary people who help solve the world&#8217;s most urgent challenges, create meaning through art, and contribute to the common good from every field, discipline, and profession.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We are honoring the excellence of these individuals, celebrating what they have achieved so far, and imagining what they will continue to accomplish,&#8221; noted David Oxtoby, President of the American Academy. &#8220;The past year has been replete with evidence of how things can get worse; this is an opportunity to illuminate the importance of art, ideas, knowledge, and leadership that can make a better world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Through her activism and scholarship over many decades, Angela Davis has been deeply involved in movements for social justice around the world.&#160;Her work as an educator--both at the university level and in the larger public sphere--has always emphasized the importance of building communities of struggle for economic, racial, and gender justice.</span></p>
<p><span>Recently inducted into The National Women&#8217;s Hall of Fame, Davis spent 15 years as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz until her retirement in 2008. She is the author of 10 books and has lectured throughout the United States, as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America, focusing on the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination.&#160;Her books include&#160;<i>Abolition Democracy, Are Prisons Obsolete?</i>, a new edition of&#160;<i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</i>;&#160;and a&#160;collection of essays entitled&#160;<i>The Meaning of Freedom</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>James Estes is known for his groundbreaking research on the ecological role of sea otters in coastal ecosystems. His research in Alaska&#8217;s Aleutian Islands showed that sea otters are a &#8220;keystone species&#8221; that maintains kelp forest ecosystems by controlling populations of kelp-grazing sea urchins. He has also led international teams of scientists investigating how a broad range of ecosystems have been disrupted by the decline of large predators and other "apex consumers" at the top of the food chain.</span></p>
<p><span>Estes, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1978, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2014. He is also a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and has received the Western Society of Naturalists' Lifetime Achievement Award, a Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship, the C. Hart Merriam Award of the American Society of Mammalogists, and the USGS Shoemaker Award for Distinguished Achievement in Communication.</span></p>
<p><span>Barbara Rogoff is a distinguished&#160;professor of psychology who investigates the cultural and community-based aspects of children's learning,&#160;particularly in communities where schooling has not been prevalent. Her work has found especially sophisticated collaboration and attention among children from Indigenous communities of the Americas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Rogoff, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1992, is a fellow of the National Academy of Education, American Anthropological Association, Association for Psychological Sciences, American Psychological Association, and American Educational Research Association. She received the Scribner Award from the American Educational Research Association for her book, <i>Apprenticeship in Thinking</i>, and&#160;coauthored the National Academy of Sciences book, <i>How People Learn</i>. She also received a Distinguished Lifetime Contributions Award from the Society for Research in Child Development.</span></p>
<p><span>The new class joins Academy members elected before them, including <strong>Benjamin Franklin </strong>(1781) and <strong>Alexander Hamilton </strong>(1791) in the 18th century; <strong>Ralph Waldo Emerson </strong>(1864), <strong>Maria Mitchell </strong>(1848), and <strong>Charles Darwin</strong> (1874) in the 19th; <strong>Albert Einstein </strong>(1924), <strong>Robert Frost </strong>(1931), <strong>Margaret Mead </strong>(1948),&#160;<strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.</strong> (1966), and <strong>Anthony Fauci</strong> (1991) in the 20th; and more recently <strong>Bryan Stevenson</strong> (2014),&#160;<strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong> </span><span>(2018), and </span><span><strong>Anna Deavere Smith </strong>(2019)</span><span>.</span><span><br/> </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="14619ff180727017480ce726add64556"><name>covid-ole-leo</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Data team's dashboard provides campus with real-time COVID updates</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz turned to Institutional Research, Assessment and Policy Studies for help to create a dashboard that would provide frequent updates for the campus community.

<p>UC Santa Cruz turned to Institutional Research, Assessment and Policy Studies for help to create a dashboard that would provide frequent updates for the campus community. Ole Kupsch and Leo Rosen, two analysts in the department, teamed up to make it happen.</p>
<p>Until that time, both had been focusing on analyzing data related to enrollment and grades. Though neither had worked in the health field before, they knew they had the skills to make effective dashboards and interactive data portals.</p>
<p>It was one of the most important jobs they had ever worked on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect politicians and administrators to make decisions not based on a gut feel or something you think is right or anecdotal evidence,&#8221; Kupsch said. &#8220;It&#8217;s supposed to be data-driven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with health statistics came with new rules. Because of health privacy laws, the analysts could only work with aggregated data sets. As an example, they were not allowed to see who got a positive COVID&#8211;19 test or whether the person was male or female. They saw the same data that the public ultimately saw in the dashboard they created. The analysts worked to structure the data and put it in a more visually appealing format.</p>
<p>Rosen took the lead in creating the <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/">dashboard</a> on the <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu">&#8220;Roadmap to Recovery&#8221; website</a>. Working in collaboration with the university&#8217;s Molecular Diagnostic Lab and campus leadership, he crafted a portal that included the number of COVID&#8211;19 cases related to the university, the test positivity rate, the number of students in quarantine or isolation and other information. Rosen said it took a little more than a month to get the first version of the site up after he began the project in September.</p>
<p>Rosen said the experience gave him respect for what the lab was able to accomplish in such a short time. With UC Santa Cruz not having a medical school, it fell to the lab to set up a COVID&#8211;19 testing site.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without them doing the testing, there would be no data,&#8221; Rosen said.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, Rosen and Kupsch had to work on the dashboard while dealing with all the other disruptions in their lives because of pandemic restrictions. Both had to leave their office and do the work from home.</p>
<p>Rosen said he really misses being able to see people in person and easily ask his colleagues questions about anything that comes up. He much prefers actual physical conversations over emails or Zoom calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go back to the office and see people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kupsch is more comfortable working from home, though he too misses the interaction with colleagues. He said the most difficult part of the pandemic for him has been that he and his wife haven&#8217;t been able to visit their families in Germany.</p>
<p>Both Rosen and Kupsch are grateful to have been able to help the campus manage COVID&#8211;19 and to learn about different departments in the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was really cool about this was being able to work with the folks from the student health service and folks who run the testing site,&#8221; Kupsch said, adding that he usually just works with people in his field. &#8220;This was something completely new.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="14f7c39980727017480ce726cd7360e1"><name>k12-education-pandemic-lessons</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Faculty experts share pandemic-era lessons for the future of K-12 education</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers who have studied the pandemic’s impact on K-12 education share lessons they hope will be remembered for the future.&#13;

Teachers are now wrapping up their second school year affected by the turmoil of a global pandemic, but hopes are mounting for a return to normalcy in the fall. UC Santa Cruz researchers who have studied the pandemic&#8217;s impact on K-12 education share lessons they hope will be remembered as we look toward the future.</span></p>
<h3><strong><a id="lora_bartlett"></a>Redefining success in times of crisis</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lora Bartlett, associate professor of education, leads the </span></i><a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/suddenlydistant/home"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly Distant</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, a team of researchers across the country who are studying how COVID-19 has influenced teachers&#8217; work.&#160;</span></i></p>
<img alt="Lora Bartlet posing indoors" class="image align-left" height="200" src="images/bartlett_200.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="200"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching during a pandemic is hard on teachers and students. 78 percent of teachers in our study reported student engagement as a challenge in their classrooms during the fall of 2020, and 57 percent were concerned about unequal access to learning. In most cases, student participation plummeted most drastically among students from lower income households, students with special needs, English language learners, and students who were already struggling academically.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers expressed a need to focus on the social and emotional well-being of students, and they sought to balance curriculum coverage with establishing a connection with students to keep them energized for learning. Initially, education policies sought to support these teaching practices, but as the pandemic dragged on, teachers faced increasing pressure to return to pre-pandemic norms. Our research indicates that policies like premature reinstitution of state standardized testing can erode teachers&#8217; ability to create a supportive learning environment that centers student well-being and engagement during a time of crisis.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Recess as a tool for healing</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca London, associate professor of sociology, studies how elementary schools can use recess to support positive student outcomes.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Rebecca London posing in front of a red wall" class="image align-left" height="200" src="images/london_200.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="200"/>COVID-19 is the first collective trauma event that we&#8217;ve experienced in decades. Prolonged exposure to this type of stress for children can evoke a range of outcomes&#8212;anxiety, impaired memory, problems with mood control, and many other effects. We wouldn&#8217;t expect children who have experienced the stress of a pandemic to be able to perform at the same level at school or anywhere else. And we know that children from Black, Latinx, and low-income families have been affected at higher rates. Before we can address &#8220;learning loss&#8221; at school, we must focus on healing. Through play, the whole school community can heal.&#160; Play therapy is a widely-used clinical approach because it&#8217;s how children naturally work through their experiences and practice social-emotional skills like self-regulation, cooperation, and self-awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play during recess builds relationships between children and between classes and their teachers, which creates a healing environment in schools. Play can also involve physical activity, which boosts attention and cognition, and it often takes place outdoors, which is good for virus control. Adults should monitor and support play to make sure it&#8217;s safe, healthy, and inclusive. Withholding recess is the most common punishment for elementary students, and we need to rethink that. Things that look like misbehavior could be natural reactions to stress and trauma, and we don&#8217;t want to punish students for that. We also don&#8217;t want to cut into playtime as a way to make up instruction time. Play is for healing, and we need to focus on that.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Addressing inequities in mathematics instruction&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judit Moschkovich, professor of education, studies how mathematics instruction can support English learners.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Judit Moschkovich poses outdoors" class="image align-left" height="200" src="images/moskovich_200.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="200"/>The inequities in mathematics education that have been previously documented for English learners were likely exacerbated during the pandemic. English learners often have fewer opportunities to engage with high-quality mathematics instruction because of deficit views of these students and systemic issues such as a lack of certified teachers. Common teaching pitfalls include focusing on vocabulary first, treating everyday and home languages as obstacles to learning math, and simplifying math content by focusing on rote memorization. And in my interactions with mathematics educators and researchers across the country, I&#8217;ve heard informal reports that the move to online teaching may have created a shift to even more rote instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As schools recover, mathematics instruction will need to refocus on applying the strategies that research has shown are most effective to support English learners in learning mathematics with understanding. Engaging students in mathematical practices like reasoning, explaining, justifying, and conjecturing develops deep mathematical understanding and supports language and content knowledge to develop together. We should also remember that students have been through multiple types of emotional trauma. It is crucial that mathematics instruction not inflict further trauma. This is a sufficient reason to avoid high stakes math tests. Instead of testing to document &#8220;all the math I didn&#8217;t learn during the pandemic,&#8221; teachers can use short assessments at the start of a lesson to check on understanding and progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Cynthia Lewis poses outdoors" class="image align-left" height="200" src="images/lewis_200.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="200"/>The use of digital technologies as primary tools for teaching and learning during the pandemic was a challenge for community organizations that provide educational programming for underserved K-12 Latinx youth and their families. Many of the households served by these programs do not have access to technology or Wi-Fi. This contributes to the digital divide that significantly disadvantages students from low-income households. But our research observed how local nonprofit </span><a href="https://scsenderos.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senderos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnered with UCSC&#8217;s Corre La Voz service learning program, directed by Leslie Lopez&#8212;which has a long history of engaging youth through digital media&#8212;to make sure that students were able to successfully apply technology resources provided by their schools to develop language and literacy skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In analyzing interactions among participants in this partnership-based program, we found that the program succeeded in building a sense of community, even in challenging times and through remote teaching and learning. The program provided an online space to be with others who share life experiences, language, and culture. The youth are tuned in and engaged, thinking critically, asking questions, and using their imaginations. Most importantly, they are building confidence and envisioning possible futures. We hope for even stronger ties in the future as we transition to in-person sessions, assess family and youth needs through surveys and interviews, and continue to enhance the partnership.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Translating research into policy</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margarita Azmitia, professor of psychology, collaborated with a network of academics to develop a </span></i><a href="https://039d290d-c9ad-460b-94b3-feb237f4db53.filesusr.com/ugd/1e2496_f671c404f8d84a2bbd60e8243e837662.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy brief</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with recommendations for mitigating COVID-19&#8217;s impacts on education.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Margarita Azmitia poses outdoors" class="image align-left" height="200" src="images/azmitia_200.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="190"/>I joined a policy rapid response network with about 200 other scholars to target anti-racist policy issues related to children, adolescents, and their families. The particular group I worked with was focused on the effects of COVID-19 on K-12 students and their families. We were tasked with reviewing the published scholarly literature, media coverage, and reports from the Pew Research Center. We submitted short written suggestions&#8212;not more than one paragraph, with citations&#8212;to the first authors of the brief, and within a few months, a final product was published and distributed among federal and state policymakers and other stakeholders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our group was committed to underscoring the more profound effects of COVID-19 on minoritized low-income families, particularly Latinx people and African Americans. I learned a lot about how to write policy briefs in the process. In scholarly research and writing, we can&#8217;t make generalizations. We often are very careful to say &#8220;our results depend on x or y,&#8221; but you can&#8217;t do this in a policy brief because conditional statements will be dismissed. I had to be comfortable with making strong points that may create anti-racist policies on behalf of students and their families. This was not hard because, for 30 years, I have seen first-hand the challenges that minoritized, low-income, immigrant, and undocumented families face in helping their children achieve in school.&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="15427df180727017480ce7264ae8b20b"><name>princeton-review</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz named No. 3 public university  for ‘making an impact’</title><summary>Underscoring a reputation of pushing for positive change, UC Santa Cruz has been named the No. 3 public university in the nation for students focused on making an impact on the world in the Princeton Review’s latest college rankings.</summary><start-date>1619506800000</start-date><display-name>Princeton Review ranking</display-name><path>/2021/04/princeton-review</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/princeton-review</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1619559349706</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654806344305</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/ghg-research-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/ghg-research-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ghg-research-500px.jpg</name><display-name>ghg-research-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>193372</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Student looking at insect</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/ghg-research-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/ghg-research-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ghg-research-80px.jpg</name><display-name>ghg-research-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18700</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Student looking at insect</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>To identify the best schools for making an impact, Princeton Review surveyed students about their experiences and opportunities.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/princeton-300px.png</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/princeton-300px.png</link><site>news</site><name>princeton-300px.png</name><display-name>princeton-300px.png</display-name><file-size>57371</file-size><width>300</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt>Princeton Best Value Colleges badge</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Underscoring a reputation of pushing for positive change, UC Santa Cruz has been named the No. 3 public university in the nation for students focused on <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-20-best-schools-for-making-an-impact-public-schools">making an impact on the world</a> in the Princeton Review&#8217;s latest college rankings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This reaffirms so much of what UCSC and our students are all about,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find everything from <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/ucsc-barring-freedom.html">art exhibits</a> on prisons, policing and justice to research that documents the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/kelp-forests-norcal.html">collapse of kelp forests</a>. The work of our faculty and students opens minds, informs policy, and helps to create a better, more equitable world. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of what unfolds on our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz pairs high-impact research with 10 tight-knit undergraduate residential colleges that offer students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university. The colleges are guided by <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/themes/">distinct themes</a> that inform their academic and student life programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curiosity defines the student experience,&#8221; said interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Jennifer Baszile. &#8220;Students create new solutions and follow them to see where they lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since its founding, UC Santa Cruz has been on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty conducting transformative research and scholarship that serves the world. UC Santa Cruz joined the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 2019 and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities in 2020, remarkable achievements that underscore the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz shares the distinction of being the youngest member of the esteemed 65-member AAU and is one of only four members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution. Additionally, for the second year in a row, US News and World Report ranked UC Santa Cruz among the top-five universities nationally for student social mobility.</p>
<p>To identify the best schools for making an impact, Princeton Review surveyed students about community service opportunities at their school, student government, sustainability efforts, and on-campus student engagement.</p>
<p>The ranking also took into account PayScale.com&#8217;s percentage of alumni from each school that reported having high job meaning. UC Santa Cruz was also listed as <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-best-value-colleges-public-schools&amp;page=2">No. 28 on the list of Best Value Colleges (Public Schools)</a>, and No. 11 spot on the list of <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-green-colleges">Top 50 Green Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>The ranking of best value colleges is based on a &#8220;return-on-investment&#8221; analysis that factors in a university&#8217;s academic rating, financial aid rating, and cost of attendance.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1949273080727017480ce72684b1912f"><name>william-doyle-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>William Doyle, founding director of UCSC’s Institute of Marine Sciences, dies at 91</title><summary>William T.

Doyle, professor emeritus of biology and founding director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz, died peacefully at his home in Santa Cruz on April 21. He was 91.</p>
<p>A graduate of Watsonville High School, Doyle was one of the founding faculty members of UC Santa Cruz when the campus opened in 1965. He held many important administrative positions at UCSC, but was best known for his leadership in the planning and development of the campus&#8217;s marine science program. He was largely responsible for the establishment of Long Marine Laboratory, and one of the lab&#8217;s original research buildings was named in his honor in 2003, when the lab celebrated its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill was a wonderful human being who supported people and made UCSC and the world a better place,&#8221; said IMS Director Daniel Costa. &#8220;He played an essential role in building the marine science program at UCSC, and he made sure people had the resources and support they needed to succeed. He was absolutely critical in the development of my own career, and I know he touched the lives of many other people throughout the campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doyle served as chair of the campus planning committee on marine studies from 1970 to 1972, and he served as director of the Center for Coastal Marine Studies (renamed the Institute of Marine Sciences in 1983) from its establishment in 1976 until his retirement in 1991.</p>
<p>&#8220;While not a marine scientist himself, he had the vision to see that this was a field that UCSC could and should excel in, and he dedicated years to make that happen,&#8221; said Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, who succeeded Doyle as IMS director. &#8220;Bill was generous with his time, and he encouraged and supported many young scientists in the early stages of their careers, whether undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, or young faculty. He was always ready to step in and take charge to move something forward in order to make UCSC a stronger institution.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a botanist, Doyle specialized in a relatively obscure and little studied group of terrestrial nonflowering plants known as liverworts and hornworts. He was the leading authority on the liverworts and hornworts of California and published a comprehensive reference on them in 2007.</p>
<p>With the development of the campus's marine science program, however, Doyle and his students delved into various areas of marine botany, including research projects on the ecology of marine algae and marine algal aquaculture. Among the graduate students Doyle advised were Julie Packard, now executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Andrew DeVogelaere, research coordinator for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Doyle had a huge influence on so many students&#8217; lives, and the world will be a lesser place without him,&#8221; said Packard, who first met Doyle when she took his introductory botany course as an undergraduate, which led to her working in his lab and signing up for the intertidal biology field course he taught with marine biologist John Pearse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those before-dawn forays up the coast to Davenport Landing proved to be a turning point in my life, sparking my interest in ocean life and especially seaweeds,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I later got involved in founding the Monterey Bay Aquarium, seaweeds featured prominently, from the kelp forest to our kelp swirl logo. The world owes all that to Bill Doyle. More than any one during my college career, he was my mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to his leadership of the marine science program, Doyle served as dean of the Division of Natural Sciences from 1980 to 1983. He also served for two terms as chair of the Department of Biology, and served as deputy and acting provost during the early development of Oakes College. He worked closely with J. Herman Blake, founding provost of Oakes College, to develop the college&#8217;s science program.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a colleague Bill Doyle profoundly influenced my work during my 18 years at UCSC. As friends we shared life perspectives that made each of us better persons,&#8221; Blake said. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s counsel and leadership gave life to the vision Ralph Guzman and I had for an outstanding science program at Oakes College. We created a singularly unique program that opened a new world to many students.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, Doyle also played the French horn in the Santa Cruz County and Monterey County Symphonies from 1966 to 1980.</p>
<p>Doyle was born in 1929 in Coalinga, California. His parents divorced when he was five, and his mother moved with her four children to Soledad, a small farming community in Monterey County. While still in grammar school, Doyle began working to help support the family, doing yard work and delivering newspapers during the school year, and working during the summers on farms and ranches, in a fruit packing shed, and in a grain warehouse.</p>
<p>In 1944, the family moved to Watsonville, where Doyle graduated from Watsonville High School in 1947. He served in the California National Guard from 1948 to 1949, and in the U.S. Air Force from 1949 to 1952. In 1953, he married Glendawyn (Glennie) Cox, whom he had met in high school, where they both played in the school orchestra. She died in 2020.</p>
<p>Doyle received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees in botany from UC Berkeley. He spent five years on the faculty of Northwestern University in Illinois before coming to UCSC as a founding faculty member in 1965.</p>
<p>In recent years, Doyle published two books on the history of the UCSC campus. <em>The Origin of UC Santa Cruz</em> (Lulu, 2014) focused on the events leading to the establishment of the campus in Santa Cruz, and <em>UC Santa Cruz: 1960&#8211;1991</em> (Lulu, 2011) covered the campus beginnings and early development of science programs and facilities, with an emphasis on the marine sciences.</p>
<p>Doyle is survived by his daughters Shelley, Carol, Jean, and Mary, and three grandchildren.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banana Slugs showed off their creativity and adaptability during last week&#8217;s all-virtual Alumni Week, a celebration that made the most of its online format and featured more than 70 live events from April 19&#8211;25.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it&#8217;s nice to hug former roommates, sit down for a picnic lunch at Quarry Plaza, and hoist some craft-brewed pints in the newly restored Quarry Amphitheater. But this year&#8217;s Alumni Week revelers didn&#8217;t have to scramble for parking, or jog-walk around the notoriously hilly and forested campus to get from one event to the other.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, attendees could take in just about everything, from a thought-provoking conversation about the afterlife of slavery with writer and scholar Saidaya Hartman, to a discussion with biomolecular engineer Ed Green about solving a 150-year-old San Francisco mystery by using cutting-edge DNA techniques he&#8217;s developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week also offered a brand-new twist called Banana Slug Share Sessions, featuring an all-star group of Slug alumni who shared what they knew in a series of informal &#8220;classes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers were thrilled at the public response to their hard work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After having had to cancel all of Alumni Weekend 2020's festivities due to lockdowns, we knew we wanted to engage alumni in a thoughtful way this year,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz senior events coordinator Diana Hogue. &#8220;So we challenged ourselves to come up with a unique collection of alumni-focused events. It all came together very organically and serendipitously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create this fun-filled week, &#8220;there was a whole lot of lifting and coordinating&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and outreach on the backend, but all the hard work yielded success,&#8221; Hogue said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendance boomed. Though event organizers are still figuring out the exact numbers, they had well over 3,000 people show up to various events throughout the week. Historically speaking, that is a whopping number. In past years, analog versions of Alumni Weekend have attracted a crowd of about 1,000 people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed any part of Alumni Week, you can </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRYckK179c3S8fxVxqWntxd7HmC822n-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">catch recordings of the events here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People were together in the virtual space and in very good spirits at that,&#8221; Hogue said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Honoring history</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social justice loomed large during Alumni Week. Acclaimed artist Dread Scott had a live conversation with UC Davis history professor Erin Gray to talk about Scott&#8217;s participation in a collaborative and galvanizing work, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slave Rebellion Reenactment</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a community-engaged performance reenacting the largest rebellion of enslaved people in U.S. history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said all of his work has one thing in common.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It really asks the audience to imagine how the world could be radically different and better,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presentation featured snippets from a video of the reenactment, which took place on November 8&#8211;9, 2019, and reimagined the German Coast Uprising of 1811. The rebellion does not receive the historical attention it deserves, Scott noted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of reenactors took part in the re-creation, and though they wore historically accurate clothing, Scott and his collaborators made no attempt to sequester the participants from modern buildings. Scott liked the idea of filming the marchers in front of contemporary structures to create a strong sense of cognitive dissonance for viewers, opening up a dialogue and making them question their assumptions about history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the crowd showed defiance and resistance, there was also a strong sense of community, hope, and even celebration, as the marchers chanted, &#8220;Liberty!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was not a project about slavery, it was a project about Black joy and liberation and freedom,&#8221; said Scott.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Mutual aid and community support&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the traditional, all-analog version of Alumni Weekend, alumni would find and greet each other based on the information scribbled on their identification stickers. Pioneer alumni from Crown College and old-timers from Merrill College would gather around the same table and swap stories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, there were no badges or tables, but the open dialogues and &#8220;chat&#8221; function in the various Alumni Week webinars had a similar social element, with old friends and new acquaintances reaching out to one another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was certainly the case during a First-Generation Arts Alumni Panel event, intended to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise the visibility of first-generation arts alumni and students at UC Santa Cruz by highlighting their artistic gifts as well as the challenges they faced as they embarked on careers in the arts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The virtual format served an event that was all about community building and mutual aid among artists. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-generation college student </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Leong (Porter '12, art) said her family always supported her creativity, but when she started out at UC Santa Cruz, she still had to find mentors and a strong artistic direction. She is grateful to her arts professors, especially wood shop manager Brian Quan, who urged her to learn how to be a bike mechanic so she could always support herself as she continued working on creative fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leong spoke of overcoming hardship. After graduation, and in between jobs, she went through a period of doubt about her portfolio of illustrations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt like I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then she was nominated for a prestigious Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship, which bolstered her confidence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then I thought, &#8216;I guess I do have an idea of what I&#8217;m doing,'&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;I identify with anyone who has had to figure it out on their own. I&#8217;m so grateful to hear other people&#8217;s stories of finding their own validation.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the alumni panel discussion, Karina Tavares Perez </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Porter '18, art), who started printmaking at UC Santa Cruz in late 2016, urged other recent creative-minded UC Santa Cruz graduates to be bold, to not give up, and to make sure to team up with other young artists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is super important after graduation to find the people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who motivate you, who support you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of my goals as one of the arts alumni is to bring more resources to campus, passing down what I have now to current students."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez is working to set up a direct-funding program that benefits UCSC students who are interested in printmaking.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts and community were also at the center of a Banana Slug Share session </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGLwOVeY5M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering a historical look at the arts at UC Santa Cruz from 1975&#8211;1977</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with fascinating snippets of vintage student-made documentaries, and an eye-opening look at the creative careers that arose from those freewheeling times.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Flashbacks!&#8221;&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone wrote &#8220;Flashbacks!&#8221; in the chat function during that Banana Slug Share </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Session, which was called &#8220;Historical Glimpse into the Arts at UCSC 1975&#8211;77: Student Film Doc &amp; Video Synth.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no wonder that this session brought forth such strong upwellings of nostalgia. During the talk, two Kresge alumni, Denise Gallant (Kresge '76, film and English literature) and Rob Schafer (Kresge '75, communications, media, and performance), shared rare video footage of vintage 1970s UC Santa Cruz through an uninhibited creative lens, with images of modern dancers, pooling shadows, grids, fractals, waves, and someone jumping off of a wall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some revelers, that wild documentary was like a moving, pulsating yearbook. In several instances, attendees either recognized themselves in the video or saw someone they knew.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there were many groovy&#8212;and more recent&#8212;images from Gallant&#8217;s career as a &#8220;modular video synth" practitioner, providing visuals for such groups as Devo and the Residents, as well as an eye-catching color-saturated backdrop for the band Tangerine Dream. It just goes to show that wild creativity can end up being a way to make a living.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Using DNA to solve a heartbreaking mystery&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate professor of biomolecular engineering Ed Green gave a Kraw Lecture that showed how DNA-based forensics can be used to solve a remarkable array of mysteries, from forensic genetic genealogy to identifying suspects in violent crime.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His presentation revealed how the UC Santa Cruz Genetics Lab helped solve the mystery of a little girl dubbed &#8220;Miranda Eve.&#8221; In May of 2016, a contractor happened upon the child's skeleton in a casket while excavating a family&#8217;s backyard in the Lone Mountain neighborhood of San Francisco, setting off a search for the child's identity that made headlines all over the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green was one of the experts called upon by UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens, who had offered to help when he learned of the case. Green's initial analysis of the nuclear DNA taken from samples of the girl&#8217;s hair, combined with the efforts of genealogy experts, historians, and vintage photos of San Francisco, led to the solving of the mystery. &#8220;Miranda Eve&#8221; was really Edith Howard Cook, who was born on November 28, 1873, and died in October 1876, just short of her 3rd birthday.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grave was apparently disinterred after a post-1906 earthquake building and population boom in San Francisco, leading to the relocation of many corpses because of the insatiable hunger for unbuilt land. After the little girl was reburied, the Knights of Columbus held a special ceremony, which Green attended.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a very strange funeral,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;But it was interesting, almost uplifting, because the Knights of Columbus had volunteered to make this happen.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was also given a brand-new headstone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was an awesome thing,&#8221; Green remarked. &#8220;This may be the last time that the results of my work are literally etched in stone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Recognizing excellence&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other highlights included a heartfelt ceremony honoring the five recipients of this year&#8217;s Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award, a high-achieving group that is helping to shape 21st century feminist thought, fostering inclusion and creativity in the theater arts, conducting pioneering cancer research, and much more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The honoreees are </span><strong>bell hooks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;83, literature), the highly influential writer, political theorist, and professor whose works are part of the intellectual canon; </span><strong>Adrian Scott Centeno</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (M.A. &#8217;16, theater arts), who rose to national prominence as a new play dramaturg, theater history and criticism lecturer, and arts education programmer after graduating from UC Santa Cruz; writer, author, and academic</span><strong> Macarena G&#243;mez-Barris</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;04, sociology), who praised the strength of cultural studies, environmental studies, Latina/o/x and Latin American studies, and feminist studies at UC Santa Cruz; </span><strong>Rachel Karchin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;03, computer engineering), now a pioneering cancer researcher and professor of biomedical engineering, oncology, and computer science at Johns Hopkins University, who studied bioinformatics and computational biology at UC Santa Cruz; and </span><strong>Ian Walton </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. &#8217;77, mathematics), an independent educator, consultant, and former president of the statewide Academic Senate for the California community colleges system, who came to UC Santa Cruz in 1973 as a Fulbright Scholarship graduate student in mathematics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Studies Division Professional Development Coordinator and Event Organizer Sonya Newlyn placed an emphasis on each recipient&#8217;s strong sense of mentorship and the importance of working for the common good.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each of them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">educates,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and their life work has continued the mission of UC Santa Cruz since they left this campus with their advanced degrees,&#8221; Newlyn said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/distinguished-grad-school-alumni-feature-2021.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read about this year&#8217;s group of honorees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and watch the full ceremony.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Slugs in politics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other highlights included a talk by Terri McCullough (Oakes &#8217;90, politics),&#160; chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCullough, the recipient of the Distinguished Alumni Award for Social Sciences, spoke about the values she learned at UCSC and how this shaped her leadership and career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her talk, held in memory of UC Santa Cruz alumnus Gabriel &#8220;Gabe&#8221; Zimmerman, provided an inside look into her work. Zimmerman (Stevenson, '02, sociology) was working for Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords as her Director of Community Outreach when he was tragically shot and killed in 2011.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other highlights: former Santa Cruz Mayor Cynthia Chase (Merrill &#8217;01, psychology) also joined the political discourse with a discussion of strategies for electing more underrepresented people to public office in a talk called &#8220;Breaking The Glass Ballot." Former State Senator and current Alumni Regent Art Torres (Stevenson, &#8216;68, government) and State Senator John Laird (Stevenson, '72, politics) talked about their time at UCSC, and how this experience led to their distinguished careers in politics.</span></p>

and Biological Sciences (PBSci) as the recipients of the PBSci Distinguished Alumni Awards.</p>
<p>The division established the awards to honor graduates of the division who have gone on to extraordinary accomplishments in diverse fields and whose careers are characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service.</p>
<h4>Ian Walton</h4>
<p>A prominent leader in California higher education, Ian Walton dedicated his career to helping California&#8217;s most underserved students overcome barriers to their dreams posed by mathematics requirements. After receiving his Ph.D. in mathematics from UC Santa Cruz in 1977, he served for 30 years on the faculty at Mission College, including five years as president of the local academic senate. For 12 years he was a member of the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges, where he served two years as president working for the statewide adoption of enhanced English and mathematics graduation competencies and the creation of the Basic Skills Initiative. Although retired for a decade, he has just completed a two-year term as Chair of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>
<h4>Lisa Dabek</h4>
<p>Lisa Dabek is the senior conservation scientist at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington, and founding director of the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). She received her B.A. in biology and environmental studies/natural history at UC Santa Cruz 1983, then earned a Ph.D. in animal behavior and conservation biology at the University of Washington, where she is currently an affiliate faculty member. Under her leadership, the TKCP partnered with indigenous landowners, scientists, students, educators, government officials, and healthcare professionals to help establish PNG&#8217;s first conservation area, protecting over 180,000 acres of rainforest habitat for the endangered Matschie&#8217;s tree kangaroo and other threatened species. The program has garnered global recognition as a model for interdisciplinary and community-based conservation.</p>
<h4>James Skinner</h4>
<p>James Skinner, the Joseph O. &amp; Elizabeth S. Hirschfelder Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, is a prominent theoretical chemist who studies the structure and dynamics of condensed phases, most often in liquids. He received his B.A. in chemistry and physics at UC Santa Cruz in 1975. After earning a Ph.D. in chemical physics at Harvard University, he went on to an NSF postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and faculty positions at Columbia University, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Chicago. With 230 publications to his name, he has received many accolades, including a Guggenheim fellowship, the American Chemical Society Irving Langmuir Award in Chemical Physics, and memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>The PBSci distinguished alumni will be honored at a virtual awards ceremony to be held on Friday, April 30, at 1 p.m. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSec7_t9_DFzJRuzHTMU2m5tnbgomaAgs6WYvXxkfCAlYqjOtw/viewform">Advance registration</a> is required to attend.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1aaf919880727017480ce7264ae65bc5"><name>review-presidential-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Systemwide Review of Presidential Policy - Fee Policy for Graduate Student In Absentia Registration </title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy - Fee Policy for Graduate Student In Absentia Registration.  &#13;

<p>The Council of Graduate Deans proposed these revisions to formalize the existing practices that took place via the exception process, allowing certain students&#8212;those who specifically requested&#8212;to file for in absentia registration while working outside of the local campus area but within California. This change will allow UC to be more explicit about the conditions under which in absentia registration may be granted, provides equitable application, and allows campus-specific implementation.&#160;</p>

<p><span><strong>Karen Yamashita</strong>, professor emerita of literature; <strong>Dana Frank</strong>, research professor in history; and&#160;<strong>Thomas Pettigrew</strong>, research professor in psychology, were each awarded Edward A. Dickson Emeritus Professorships in recognition of their outstanding achievements in scholarship and teaching.</span></p>
<p><span>The awards are given annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</span></p>
<p><span>The author of 10 books, <strong>Yamashita</strong> received a 2011 California Book Award in the Fiction category for her novel&#160;</span><span><i>I Hotel</i></span><span>, and was&#160;a finalist for the National Book Award.&#160;</span><span><i>I Hotel</i></span><span>&#160;also won the American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award, and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award.</span></p>
<p><span>Known for her intensely researched works that reflect her interest in communities whose stories often go untold, Yamashita received the&#160;Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity&#160;in 2009 and was co-holder with feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker of the UC Presidential Chair for Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;Her latest book, </span><span><i>Sansei and Sensibility</i></span><span>, is a collection of short stories about growing up and living in Japanese America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Yamashita will use the award for a project titled </span><span><i>Japanese American Incarceration: The Origins of the Loyalty Questionnaire</i><strong><i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></i></strong></span></p>
<p><span>She noted that during World War II in 1943, after 120,000 Japanese Americans were, by executive order, imprisoned in internment camps, there arose the problem of who to release for military combat and useful work outside. A questionnaire was given to each inmate for the purpose of assessing loyalty. While many of the questions seemed innocuous, two questions in particular&#8212;27 and 28, about willingness to serve in the U.S. military and forswearing any allegiance to the Japanese Emperor&#8212;were confusing and divisive within the incarcerated communities. Answering those two questions created rifts within families and friends, resulting in hostile and traumatic divisions that resonate to this day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Yamashita&#8217;s project will research archival documents to track the origins of this questionnaire as the backdrop and basis for her next novel, &#8220;Questions 27 and 28.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The Dickson Award will help emerita history professor <strong>Dana Frank</strong> complete a book about The Great Depression and what can be learned from the United States during the 1930s that is applicable to our current times. The book will dig deep into that history in order to explore the relationship between ordinary people's survival, their protests, and the transformation of the state from below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Frank noted that although she is using scholarly research to write an accessible book designed for a popular audience and college courses, it is not a textbook overview, but rather a collection of interlocked, focused essays that offer reflective looks at key dynamics and stories.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the top academic experts on Honduras in the United States,&#160;</span><span>Frank has been commenting on the volatile situation in the region&#160;</span><span>since the 2009 military coup for media ranging from the <em>New York&#160;</em></span><span><em>Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em> to <em>National Public Radio</em>, and the&#160;</span><em>Associated Press.</em></p>
<p><span>She has consistently questioned U.S. foreign policy toward&#160;</span><span>Honduras in an effort to stop the administration from supporting,&#160;</span><span>funding and perpetuating human rights abuses. She has testified In&#160;</span><span>Congress about Honduras, as well as in the California State&#160;</span><span>Assembly about the treatment of refugees from Central America.</span></p>
<p><span>Frank is the author of six books, including&#160;<i>Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism; The&#160;Long Honduran Night: Resistance, Terror, and the United States in the Aftermath of the Coup;&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Local Girl Makes History: Exploring Northern California&#8217;s Kitsch Monuments.</i></span></p>
<p><span>Emeritus psychology professor <strong>Thomas Pettigrew</strong> will use his award for a project titled <i>Racial Change in the United States 1960-2020</i>. As a research professor of social psychology, he has published more than 450 books and articles that have been cited, according to Google Scholar, more than 51,000 times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Pettigrew has been a Guggenheim Fellow, a Senior Fulbright Scholar, and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, and Stanford University&#8217;s Research Institute of Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. He previously taught at Harvard University and the University of Amsterdam before coming to UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span>Pettigrew was chair of the social psychology section of the American Sociological Association and has received the ASA&#8217;s highest awards for both race relations research and social psychology. Harvard&#8217;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences gave him its Centennial Medal for significant contributions to society, and the University of California presented him with the Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award. Pettigrew has additionally been honored with seven lifetime achievement awards from both psychological and sociological organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>His latest book, <i>Contextual Social Psychology: Reanalyzing Prejudice, Voting, and Intergroup Contact</i>, which offers a new approach for social<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><span>psychological research, was just published by The American Psychological Association Press.</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e991ccb80727017480ce726549a5429"><name>vertebrate-genomes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Project to read genomes of all 70,000 vertebrate species reports first discoveries</title><summary>A bold project to read the complete genetic sequences of every known vertebrate species has reached its first milestone, publishing new methods and the first 25 high-quality genomes.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Beth Shapiro</keywords><start-date>1619679600000</start-date><display-name>Project to read genomes of all 70,000 vertebrate species reports first discoveries</display-name><path>/2021/04/vertebrate-genomes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/vertebrate-genomes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1619716021418</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1619796904809</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</name><title></title><phone/><email>rosenm2@hhmi.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/david-haussler-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/david-haussler-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-350.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>93530</file-size><width>350</width><height>409</height></image><image-alt>David Haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/nature-cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/nature-cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nature-cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nature-cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19364</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Nature cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>David Haussler (photo by C.

<p>And now comes the first major payoff from the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP): near complete, high-quality genomes of 25 species, including the greater horseshoe bat, the Canada lynx, the platypus, and the k&#257;k&#257;p&#333; parrot, one of the first high-quality genomes of an endangered vertebrate species.</p>
<p>The VGP team, including scientists at the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>, published their findings April 28 in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-021-00001-6/index.html">special issue of <em>Nature</em></a>, with companion papers simultaneously published in other scientific journals.</p>
<p>The flagship paper lays out the technical advances that let scientists achieve a new level of accuracy and completeness and paves the way for decoding the genomes of the roughly 70,000 vertebrate species living today, said coauthor David Haussler, director of the Genomics Institute and a professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will get a spectacular picture of how nature actually filled out all the ecosystems with this unbelievably diverse array of animals,&#8221; said Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator.</p>
<p>The new results are beginning to deliver on that promise. The project team has discovered previously unknown chromosomes in the zebra finch genome, for example, and a surprise finding about genetic differences between marmoset and human brains. The new research also offers hope for saving the k&#257;k&#257;p&#333; and the endangered vaquita dolphin from extinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;These 25 genomes represent a key milestone,&#8221; explained coauthor Erich Jarvis, VGP chair and HHMI investigator at Rockefeller University. &#8220;We are learning a lot more than we expected. The work is a proof of principle for what&#8217;s to come.&#8221;</p>
<h4>From 10K to 70K</h4>
<p>The VGP milestone has been years in the making. The project&#8217;s origins date back to the late-2000s, when Haussler, geneticist Stephen O&#8217;Brien, and Oliver Ryder, director of conservation genetics at the San Diego Zoo, figured it was time to think big.</p>
<p>Instead of sequencing just a few species, such as humans and model organisms like fruit flies, why not read the complete genomes of ten thousand animals in a bold &#8220;Genome 10K&#8221; effort? At the time, though, the price tag was hundreds of millions of dollars, and the plan never really got off the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knew it was a great idea, but nobody wanted to pay for it,&#8221; recalled coauthor Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a HHMI investigator.</p>
<p>Plus, scientists&#8217; early efforts at spelling out, or &#8220;sequencing,&#8221; all the DNA letters in an animal&#8217;s genome were riddled with errors. The introduction of new sequencing technologies helped make the idea of reading thousands of genomes possible. These rapidly developing technologies slashed costs, but also reduced quality in genome assembly structure.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, Haussler and colleagues brought in Jarvis, a pioneer in deciphering the intricate neural circuits that let birds trill new tunes after listening to others&#8217; songs. Jarvis had already shown a knack for managing big, complex efforts. In 2014, he and more than a hundred colleagues sequenced the genomes of 48 bird species, which turned up new genes involved in vocal learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;David and others asked me to take on leadership of the Genome 10K project,&#8221; Jarvis recalled. &#8220;They felt I had the personality for it.&#8221; Or, as Shapiro put it: &#8220;Erich is a very pushy leader, in a nice way. What he wants to happen, he will make happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis expanded and rebranded the Genome 10K idea to include all vertebrate genomes. He also helped launch a new sequencing center at Rockefeller that, together with one at the Max Planck Institute in Germany led by former HHMI Janelia Research Campus Group Leader Gene Myers, and another at the Sanger Institute in the UK led by Richard Durbin and Mark Blaxter, is currently producing most of the VGP genome data. He asked Adam Phillippy, a leading genome expert at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to chair the VGP assembly team. Then, he found about 60 top scientists willing to use their own grant money to pay for the sequencing costs at the centers to tackle the genomes they were most interested in. The team also negotiated with the M&#257;ori in New Zealand and officials in Mexico to get k&#257;k&#257;p&#333; and vaquita samples in &#8220;a beautiful example of international collaboration,&#8221; said Sadye Paez, program director of the VGP at Rockefeller.</p>
<h4>Opening doors</h4>
<p>The massive team of researchers pulled off a series of technological advances. The new sequencing machines let them read DNA chunks 10,000 or more letters long, instead of just a few hundred. The researchers also devised clever methods for assembling those segments into individual chromosomes. They have been able to tease out which genes were inherited from the mother and the father. This solves a particularly thorny problem known as &#8220;false duplication,&#8221; where scientists mistakenly label maternal and paternal copies of the same gene as two separate sister genes.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s improved accuracy shows that previous genome sequences are seriously incomplete. In the zebra finch, for example, the team found eight new chromosomes and about 900 genes that had been thought to be missing. Previously unknown chromosomes popped up in the platypus as well, as members of the team reported online in <em>Nature</em> earlier this year. The researchers also plowed through, and correctly assembled, long stretches of repetitive DNA, much of which contain just two of the four genetic letters. Some scientists considered these stretches to be non-functional &#8220;junk&#8221; or &#8220;dark matter,&#8221; but many of the repeats occur in regions of the genome that code for proteins, said Jarvis, suggesting that the DNA plays a surprisingly crucial role in turning genes on or off.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the start of what the <em>Nature</em> paper envisions as &#8220;a new era of discovery across the life sciences.&#8221; With every new genome sequence, researchers uncover new&#8212;and often unexpected&#8212;findings.</p>
<p>The marmoset genome yielded several surprises. While marmoset and human brain genes are largely conserved, the marmoset has several genes for human pathogenic amino acids. That highlights the need to consider genomic context when developing animal models, the team reports in a companion paper in <em>Nature</em>. And in findings published last year in <em>Nature</em>, a group led by Emma Teeling at University College Dublin in Ireland discovered that some bats have lost immunity-related genes, which could help explain their ability to tolerate viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The new information also may boost efforts to save rare species. &#8220;It is a critically important moral duty to help species that are going extinct,&#8221; Jarvis says. That&#8217;s why the team collected samples from a k&#257;k&#257;p&#333; named Jane, part of a captive breeding program that has brought the parrot back from the brink of extinction. In a paper published in the journal <em>Cell Genomics</em>, Nicolas Dussex at the University of Otago and colleagues described their studies of Jane&#8217;s genes along with other individuals. The work revealed that the last surviving k&#257;k&#257;p&#333; population, isolated on an island off New Zealand for the last 10,000 years, has somehow purged deleterious mutations, despite the species&#8217; low genetic diversity. A similar finding was seen for the vaquita, with an estimated 10-20 individuals left on the planet, in a study published in <em>Molecular Ecology Resources</em>, led by Phil Morin at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries in La Jolla, California. &#8220;That means there is hope for conserving the species,&#8221; Jarvis concludes.</p>
<h4>A clear path</h4>
<p>The VGP is now focused on sequencing even more species. The project team&#8217;s next goal is finishing 260 genomes, representing all vertebrate orders, and then snaring enough funding to tackle thousands more, representing all families. That work won&#8217;t be easy, and it will inevitably bring new technical and logistical challenges. Once hundreds or even thousands of animals readily found in zoos or labs have been sequenced, scientists may face ethical hurdles obtaining samples from other species, especially when the animals are rare or endangered.</p>
<p>But with the new paper, the path ahead looks clearer than it has in years. The VGP model is even inspiring other large sequencing efforts, including the Earth Biogenome Project, which aims to decode the genomes of all eukaryotic species within 10 years. Perhaps for the first time, it seems possible to realize the dream that Haussler and many others share of reading every letter of every organism&#8217;s genome.</p>
<p>Darwin saw the enormous diversity of life on Earth as &#8220;endless forms most beautiful,&#8221; Haussler observed. &#8220;Now, we have an incredible opportunity to see how those forms came about,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.hhmi.org/news/project-to-read-genomes-of-all-70000-vertebrate-species-reports-first-discoveries</url><title>Story originally published by HHMI</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1f5e43f380727017480ce7263d620835"><name>planning-for-fall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planning for fall, UC vaccination policy coming, changes to national mask guidance</title><summary>Planning for the fall quarter remains in full swing, as we look to balance the desires of so many to return to campus to both learn and work and the need to keep our campus community healthy amid a continuing pandemic. </summary><start-date>1619679600000</start-date><display-name>Planning for fall, UC vaccination policy coming, changes to national mask guidance</display-name><path>/2021/04/planning-for-fall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/planning-for-fall</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1619728941998</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1619728941998</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz students, faculty and staff know what this university does best. We advance research that benefits both the person and the planet. At our core, we&#8217;re problem solvers who seek to change the world for the better. Well, it feels good when others take notice too! UC Santa Cruz this week was named the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/princeton-review.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF29BdYVpOlxKjUAgqwur1nAqniQw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/princeton-review.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">No. 3 public university in the nation for students focused on making an impact</a> on the world. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of our students and the difference they make! Go Slugs!</p>
<h3>The highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fall class schedule will be available May 10, as preparation continues for expanded in-person instruction.</li>
<li><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-19-policy.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkWQiqdDgrvNddzEh2plya6e_5QA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-19-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proposed policy</a> would make COVID vaccines mandatory for students, staff and faculty at all University of California campuses this fall. Public comment is open now.</li>
<li>The Spring SAB Chancellor&#8217;s Forum is May 6. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4I-sNCGqHsVQO0aphfoUrdsEf_CnQxu115m_xkOWnVHY77Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwoXr0E5kBicaS6Ezrp2L9ZEDslg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4I-sNCGqHsVQO0aphfoUrdsEf_CnQxu115m_xkOWnVHY77Q/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Submitting a question is easy!</a></li>

<h3>New campus resources open</h3>
<p>With each passing week, different campus resources are returning to in-person operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to some athletics and recreation facilities, including the pool and tennis courts, available previously to only current students via reservation or drop-in is now being offered to university employees with active Slug Recreation memberships. For a full list of what is available and when, visit the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recreation.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYR7QCk8PG3-QUP4NHXkZocgYAgg" href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Recreation website</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Academic planning for fall</h3>
<p>Planning for the fall quarter remains in full swing, as we look to balance the desires of so many to return to campus to both learn and work and the need to keep our campus community healthy amid a continuing pandemic. Our plans are unchanged: We&#8217;re looking at predominantly in-person instruction with the caveat that, if COVID conditions suddenly worsen, we will need to pivot. Importantly, there will be pathways to support progress toward degrees for students who need to continue learning remotely.</p>
<p>As I noted previously, the fall class schedule, including the mode of instruction, remains on track to be released by May 10 so students can plan coursework. The housing application processes for both summer and the 2021-22 academic year will also be opened soon. We aim to welcome as many students into university housing as public health circumstances allow. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/2021-22/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEp2ed7HCycbnZmbQMUrOS6QsGOg" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/2021-22/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">More information is available online</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes to national guidance on mask wearing</h3>
<p>Federal health officials announced earlier this week that individuals can now go without masks outdoors when exercising (walking, running, biking or &#8212; here in Santa Cruz &#8212; surfing). This <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWLeQDGaAVEsWWABLInOyVK9jD1A" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new guidance</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is for people two weeks past their final COVID-19 vaccination shot and for those who have yet to be innoculated. Additional guidance was offered for other scenarios. It feels great to be moving in this direction, but note that the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHX9ucpH5jDEcIPZ8RWXBOBdM8cEg" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus protocols</a> have yet to change. We are currently reviewing the CDC guidelines and will soon detail any planned changes.</p>
<h3>UC vaccination policy</h3>
<p>As you saw in a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-19-policy.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkWQiqdDgrvNddzEh2plya6e_5QA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-19-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message</a> from Lori and me last week, the University of California Office of the President is <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-encourages-covid-19-vaccinations-university-communities-while-reviewing-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE__kp6c3nb0Cu5ZdnsaKtSJcbCdw" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-encourages-covid-19-vaccinations-university-communities-while-reviewing-policy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposing a policy</a> that would make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus beginning in fall quarter 2021. The policy is not finalized &#8212; feel free to provide feedback by emailing comments to <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pco@ucsc.edu</a>. UCOP purposefully announced its plan before final review by various constituencies to provide more time for students and employees to obtain the vaccine ahead of the fall term and to allow time for feedback.</p>
<h3>Regular COVID testing</h3>
<p>The growing number of people vaccinated and the changing mask guidance from the CDC means we&#8217;re on the right side of the curve when it comes to COVID. We have changed our asymptomatic testing program to reflect the improving conditions, dropping the testing requirement for students living, working or taking classes on campus from two tests per week to only one, but it is still in place and still mandatory for these students &#8212; even if you have been vaccinated! <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdK0W1hMOMLWvSbf_eHAYKlEneow" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/covid-testing-requirements.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The new protocol is laid out in detail in a message to students</a>. Thank you all for doing your part to keep our community safe.</p>
<h3>Protect your information</h3>
<p>I know that the news of the systemwide Acceleron data breach has left many on our campus concerned and distraught. Our campus Information technology team has posted some <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/news/dark-web.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPeYDNKxaRfsHwbVbSL4nAnoOYHQ" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/news/dark-web.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">helpful information</a> for those in our community who have been notified that their information has been found on the dark web since the breach. The Office of the President has also posted a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/updates-faq/accellion-faq.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRR0kGCjlUFrFgflLfSYOAowLbiQ" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/updates-faq/accellion-faq.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">frequently asked questions and answers page</a> on its website. Please take the steps suggested to protect your data and identity. They are not especially onerous, and can offer some peace of mind.</p>

<h3>Tackling stress</h3>
<p>It would be near impossible to think up a more perfect storm of life stresses, with social and political unrest squarely in the middle of a global pandemic &#8212; unless, of course, you&#8217;re also in college, away from home for the first time, getting ready for your end-of-quarter exams. The good news is that help is available and no one in our campus community needs to face issues alone. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the many wellness and support programs offered through our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/colleges/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-HLBp7JXg6u6oUHqE8hsKrXggig" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/colleges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">colleges</a>, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1cEIYChqYqIyoqHxP9a3c9SNrFg" href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resource centers</a>, and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGy05OXsFkjWycuauctYi0Ab788gw" href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Support program</a>.

<h3>Take a bow</h3>
<p>Special thanks to our University Relations team, who organized last week&#8217;s virtual alumni celebration, and folks throughout our campus community who pitched in to pull off 71 events with 3,500 participants. I&#8217;m exceptionally proud of all the successes we&#8217;ve seen collectively over the past year &#8212; this alumni celebration being just the latest example. As part of Alumni Week, we put together a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dljj-WKMampM&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5yvAaoN7BqcNTdJAYXjISFq0I3Q" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljj-WKMampM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">special edition of our popular UCSC Minute</a>. Take a look, and know that with every positive development in our collective fight against COVID, we are a step closer to a new academic year with more in-person, on-campus engagement.</p>
<h3>No matter where you are &#8230;</h3>
<p>On campus or off, in California or halfway across the globe, you are still Banana Slugs, which means you can still access campus resources, engage with other Slugs, and stay connected to the UCSC community. Here are some ways to connect:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Slugs are invited to participate in the next installment of the Unlonely Slugs project, a collaboration with the Foundation for Art and Healing. The events are a relaxed and engaging hour of creativity and conversation that aim to help participants stay socially connected and healthy through the arts. The next event, on May 14, will include a screening of the films &#8220;I Forgot my Phone&#8221; and &#8220;Drawings for my Grandchildren.&#8221; <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/unlonely-slugs/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH68PQSDQhs6whqZl9F0gS4hf4tVQ" href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/unlonely-slugs/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Log on and meet up with your fellow Slugs</a>.</li>
<li>Campus elections are early next month. Undergraduates and graduate students are asked to cast their ballots for leaders of the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and Student Union Assembly (SUA). An amendment to the SUA Constitution is also on the electronic ballot. The polls are open May 3-10. Make your voice heard! More details can be found on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwVJrMm7kBl7P9H_b09_aljoFnAg" href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dean of Students election website</a>. An SUA candidates debate is set for 6 p.m. April 30. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_RFVoCjPJR7W6zSmOTWHNgQ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619813906937000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFx4faMaAJr3vB3kcASzZ0HnzGRYA" href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_RFVoCjPJR7W6zSmOTWHNgQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Registration</a> is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the summer-like weather or the good news we&#8217;ve seen on the COVID front in the U.S., but this quarter feels supercharged. Spring quarter is somehow already halfway over. My years in higher education remind me that now is the time to support one another as we push through to the finish line! Onward, Slugs!</p>

The PIT University Network Challenge seeks to encourage new ideas, foster collaborations, and incentivize the sharing of resources and informations among network members. For its third year, the program invites projects addressing any of the following priority areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational Offerings</li>
<li>Career Pipeline/Placement</li>
<li>Faculty &amp; Institution Building</li>
<li>Strengthening the PIT University Network</li>
</ul>
<p>The Network Challenge provides grants up to $180,000 for projects focused on developing technology expertise to advance the public interest in a way that generates public benefits and promotes the public good, particularly for those members of our society least well served, historically and today, by existing systems and policies. The RFP is only open to submissions from researchers at member universities. As a member since 2019-20, all UCSC principal investigators are eligible to participate.</p>
<p>A limited campus submission process will select up to three new campus proposals for submission to the network-wide competition. Campus submissions are due by 11:59 pm PDT, June 1, 2021, and requires a shortened version of the final proposal. The limited submission RFP and application portal is available at <a href="https://ucsc.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1841841">ucsc.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1841841</a></p>
<p>Campus applicants chosen in the limited submission review will then further develop their proposals for the national deadline of 11:59 pm PDT, July 15, 2021. Final proposals are limited to 6 pages maximum in total length.</p>

These <a href="https://www.acls.org/Recent-Awardees/Mellon-ACLS-Dissertation-Completion-Fellows">fellowships</a>&#8212;made possible by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&#8212;support promising doctoral students in humanities and social sciences with $43,000 funding awards to complete the final year of their dissertation research and writing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estrella was selected as one of 72 nationwide fellowship winners from a pool of more than 1,000 applicants. He said the award has been &#8220;a huge relief&#8221; because it will allow him to really dedicate himself to writing his dissertation. Estrella studies the ideologies that drive U.S. national security policy, and over the past few years, he&#8217;s poured through thousands of declassified and leaked national security documents dating all the way back to the Cold War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The really interesting thing about these formerly classified documents is that, in them, the government actually tells the truth,&#8221; Estrella said. &#8220;Getting to read these documents shows you what analysts and policy makers were really thinking.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout these documents, Estrella is looking for indicators of how U.S. national security policy has evolved over time. The National Security Act of 1947 created many of the governmental policies and structures we associate with national security today, and originally, one of the primary goals was preventing nuclear attack. But much has changed since then.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many more issues have been incorporated into this national security logic,&#8221; Estrella said. &#8220;Four years ago, during congressional hearings on family separation, a border official was asked if a three-year-old immigrant posed a national security threat for entering the country illegally. He said he didn&#8217;t know. It might have made sense that nuclear war was a threat, but now a three-year-old girl is a potential national security threat? What has changed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estrella sees this question as essential for understanding both foreign and domestic policy in the United States. After all, the U.S. has invaded or intervened in other countries many times over the years in the name of national security, including countries throughout Latin America. Meanwhile, national security is frequently evoked to justify domestic policies like militarization of police and surveillance of residents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What drives all of these policies is an ideology,&#8221; Estrella said. &#8220;If people believe they are under a constant existential threat, then they are going to be more likely to support these types of authoritarian practices. In a way, national security ideology drives nondemocratic practices international and domestically.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his dissertation, Estrella hopes to shed new light on these ideologies and their global impacts in a way that might spark meaningful change. Currently, even the most harmful U.S. national security policies often receive little pushback from elected officials.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There might be strong disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over many issues, but national security policies often garner broad bipartisan support,&#8221; Estrella said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2048712780727017480ce72604670109"><name>support-for-india</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Center for South Asian Studies supporting aid efforts for India</title><summary>The Center for South Asian Studies at UC Santa Cruz is encouraging the campus community to support aid efforts for India, which is grappling with a dramatic increase in COVID-19 infections. </summary><start-date>1619679600000</start-date><display-name>Center for South Asian Studies supporting aid efforts for India</display-name><path>/2021/04/support-for-india</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/04/support-for-india</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1619744289025</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1619814470501</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/04/images/support-for-india.png</path><link>site://news/2021/04/images/support-for-india.png</link><site>news</site><name>support-for-india.png</name><display-name>support-for-india.png</display-name><file-size>15976</file-size><width>338</width><height>78</height></image><image-alt>Center for South Asian Studies</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for South Asian Studies at UC Santa Cruz is encouraging the campus community to support aid efforts for India, which is grappling with a dramatic increase in COVID-19 infections.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The news coming out of India continues to be heartbreaking as we learn more about the scale and scope of the pandemic," the center said in call to action. "Infections continue to rise, oxygen shortages remain a concern, and we are yet to fully know the extent of human loss and deprivation. The Center for South Asian Studies has been tracking these developments with concern and extends our solidarity and support to all students, faculty and community members who have kin in South Asia."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center is asking anyone in a position to donate to consider supporting organizations that are helping provide food rations, personal protective equipment, and much-need infrastructural support to the most disenfranchised communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor Anjali Arondekar, co-director of the center, said she carefully screened organizations. The ones listed are also able to accept donations in U.S. dollars.&#160;</span></p>
