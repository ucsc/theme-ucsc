New research shows that atypical currents, rather than abnormal temperatures, likely bring them up from their home range off Baja California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the discovery, the scientists also created a seawater flow index that could help researchers and managers detect abnormal current years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new study, published July 1 in </span><a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.11870"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limnology and Oceanography</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, began after lead author Megan Cimino biked past a pelagic red crab stranding on her way to her office in Monterey in 2018. Cimino, a biological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and UC Santa Cruz through the Institute of Marine Sciences Fisheries Collaborative Program, had witnessed a different stranding near where she grew up in Southern California a few years prior.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At that time, I had no clue what a red crab was, what was going on, why they would be there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it was very clear something different was going on in the ocean&#8212;something unusual.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She brought the question to her colleagues, and the lab decided to dive into the mechanism behind the seemingly random appearances.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group spent months compiling data about the crabs and their recorded range. They scoured oceanographic research surveys, video data from remotely operated vehicles, citizen science programs, and even online media, such as Twitter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating the different data types proved challenging, but eventually the team had a clear idea of the species&#8217; range and strandings from 1950 to 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing these data with ocean conditions like temperature and current movements, the scientists found that the appearance of red crabs outside of their normal range correlated with the amount of seawater flowing from Baja California to central California. The finding supports strong currents as the key indicator for the presence of the crabs over the other major hypothesis&#8212;that warm water brought by marine heatwaves and El Ni&#241;o events causes the appearances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To study the currents, the researchers used a regional ocean model of the California Current System, developed by researchers in the </span><a href="https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz ocean modeling group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What you're doing is putting a tracer&#8212;you could think of it like a dye&#8212;into a particular part of the ocean and then running the model backwards in time to see where that came from,&#8221; said Michael Jacox, a physical oceanographer with dual affiliation with NOAA and UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on those tracer experiments, the team created the &#8220;southern source water index&#8221; (SSWI), which shows how much water off the central California coast comes from south of the U.S.-Mexico border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s that pathway of water that brings up some of these unusual species,&#8221; said Ryan Rykaczewski, a fisheries oceanographer at NOAA and the University of Hawai&#8216;i at M&#257;noa. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just the pelagic red crabs, even though those might be the most conspicuous species that we see on the coast.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red crabs draw the public&#8217;s interest and serve as an important food source for lots of other species. These factors made them a good study subject, but they&#8217;re not the only thing brought up by currents. They represent a larger phenomenon that researchers can use the SSWI to better understand.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The index could be used as a kind of early warning system about what the ocean state is that year and whether we're going to expect southern species in northern regions,&#8221; said Cimino. &#8220;That can help us plan and manage and give expectations for bycatch or different fisheries.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As climate change increases variability in ocean conditions, the locations of species will begin to shift. Knowing where to look for particular organisms helps researchers make more accurate observations and population estimates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can go back and look at that source water index and use that perhaps as a predictive tool of how the composition of coastal species is going to change,&#8221; said Rykaczewski. &#8220;And that might help us with ecosystem management.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way currents shift is an often-overlooked piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding climate change. Scientists are now in the process of testing whether the southern source water index is sensitive to it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We think a lot about the changes in things like temperature and oxygen, but changes in the contribution of waters from different locations in the broader North Pacific is also really important for understanding climate change,&#8221; said Rykaczewski.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement of pelagic red crabs provides just one example of the practical applications of such studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it's really, really important that when we think about climate change, we don't just think about &#8216;warm temperature equals some response&#8217;, and we really try to dig into the mechanisms,&#8221; said Jacox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the case study of red crabs and the creation of the southern source water index, researchers now have another tool for doing just that.</span></p>

Zhu applied for the award last year as a pre-tenure faculty member. The funding will support research to model global interconnections between climate change and plant phenology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As climate change raises global average temperatures, phenology&#8212;the study of seasonal life processes&#8212;shows that many plants are responding by shifting the timing of temperature-dependent life events, like flowering and the growth of new leaves. But these changes in phenology can, in turn, affect the rate of climate change by altering the role plants play in important climate system processes, like carbon uptake. The new research will aim to quantify global changes in plant phenology in ways that predict and incorporate the complexity of climate feedback loops.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The basic idea of the project is to view climate change and phenology as an integrated system, with influences from both directions,&#8221; Zhu said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish this, Zhu and his research team will need to combine traditional ecology methods with data science tools. They&#8217;ll incorporate everything from individual observations of plants and flowers to findings from formalized regional experiments and satellite remote-sensing data in order to form a clearer picture of the interconnections between climate change and phenology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we are doing is scaling up ecology research on this topic to show how what you&#8217;re finding in one place may also apply to other places or may affect what happens in other places,&#8221; Zhu explained. &#8220;And we&#8217;re injecting modern, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to help address these complex ecological questions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings from this research could have several important applications. A better understanding of climate change impacts on plant phenology can inform agricultural management to maximize crop yields. And more accurate forecasting of regional pollen counts could help allergy sufferers navigate longer pollen seasons and increasing pollen loads. Phenological changes also offer a unique opportunity for climate change education, which is another goal of the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we talk to the public about climate change, the changes in temperature that we&#8217;re seeing are hardly detectable by normal people, but what we can easily see is that a lot of things are happening in biological systems as a result,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;Flowering is getting earlier, growing seasons are getting longer; we can use people&#8217;s own observations of phenology to raise awareness that this is attributed to climate change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With support from the&#160;</span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/building-belonging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Belonging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program&#8212;offered through the&#160;<a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Social Transformation</a>&#160;in the Division of Social Sciences&#8212;Zhu has already been working with environmental studies graduate student Yiluan Song and undergraduates Caitlin Schilt, Jade Guzman, and Luke Hamilton to study how people use social media to observe phenology. Now, the new NSF funding will allow the team to build a series of websites and apps that will integrate citizen science and social media to provide hands-on climate education related to plant phenology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see phenology observations as a new opportunity to make people more aware of climate change, and we can allow people to generate phenological knowledge instead of just receiving it,&#8221; said Yiluan Song. &#8220;We also want to make daily delivery of pollen forecasting information to people who are potentially suffering from pollen allergies, and this can help people understand the link from public health to phenology and then to climate change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NSF grant will also support the development of graduate-level data science classes in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at UC Santa Cruz. And a partnership with local high schools will offer students guided &#8220;phenology walks&#8221; through the UCSC Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden to learn more about climate change by collecting citizen science data. Zhu said he has been particularly excited that his NSF CAREER Award will allow him to combine these elements with the opportunity to generate new research findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not only pure scientific research, in the traditional sense, but also outreach and education to university students, other students, and the public,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="694123fb8072704647a15c51d44a474e"><name>low-pollution-fish-feed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New research on aquaculture feed will test alternative ingredients to help minimize water pollution</title><summary>A new grant will support UC Santa Cruz’s ecological aquaculture lab in their efforts to increase the variety and quality of low-polluting aquaculture feed options available to fish farmers.  </summary><start-date>1625209200000</start-date><path>/2021/07/low-pollution-fish-feed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/low-pollution-fish-feed</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1625263514593</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1625779317230</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/07/images/trout_450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/07/images/trout_450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>trout_450.jpg</name><display-name>trout_450.jpg</display-name><file-size>64177</file-size><width>450</width><height>285</height></image><image-alt>Rainbow trout swim inside an aquaculture tank at UC Santa Cruz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/07/images/trout_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/07/images/trout_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>trout_80.jpg</name><display-name>trout_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24482</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rainbow trout swim inside an aquaculture tank at UC Santa Cruz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s ecological aquaculture lab, researchers are working with rainbow trout to test new sustainable fish feed formulas developed using alternative ingredients.

This funding will support collaborative research to develop, test, and evaluate new low-polluting fish feed formulas for farm-raised rainbow trout.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Research Professor of Environmental Studies Pallab Sarker will lead this work alongside Environmental Studies Professor Anne Kapuscinski and Luke Gardner, a California Sea Grant extension specialist affiliated with UC San Diego. The team will use a marine microalga as an ingredient in their fish feed, and the resulting experimental formulas will be field-tested at working trout farms in California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. aquaculture has some of the most stringent environmental standards in the world, and U.S. trout farms have led the way in adopting low-polluting feeds to meet these high standards. The UC Santa Cruz team hopes their work will create an environmentally sustainable and economically viable new feed option to help increase the variety and quality of low-polluting feeds available to fish farmers around the world.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-polluting fish feed varieties contain as little nitrogen and phosphorus as possible and provide these nutrients in a form that is easily digested and absorbed by fish, to minimize the amount that fish will subsequently excrete in their waste.&#160;This is important because high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus could otherwise have the potential to fuel algal blooms in waterways, if wastewater from large-scale fish production weren't handled properly. Low-polluting fish feeds are specially formulated to prevent this, which makes them</span>&#160;a great example of how scientific innovation and industry partnerships have advanced the sustainability of aquaculture.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Redesigning the composition of aquaculture feed has been a key leverage point for addressing nutrient pollution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Sarker explained.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Low-pollution aquaculture feeds help to conserve natural ecosystems and provide clean water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker and Kapuscinski have been working for years to develop new sustainable fish feed formulas by recycling leftover biomass from the commercial production of marine microalgal species, which are used to make omega-3 dietary supplements for humans. Most of the team&#8217;s </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/usda-grant-aquaculture.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been geared toward combining different marine microalgae to replace traditional fish meal and fish oil feed ingredients sourced from wild-caught fish. But the team also wants their feed formulas to be low-polluting. So the new grant will test this aspect.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, researchers will experiment with different methods for processing microalgal ingredients to make them as digestible as possible for rainbow trout. Next, they&#8217;ll determine the ideal amount of microalgae that can be substituted for fish-based ingredients. Then, they&#8217;ll develop low-polluting diets and determine both their effects on trout growth and their potential for minimizing water pollution from resulting trout waste.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These initial steps will take place in the aquaculture research lab at the UCSC Farm, but thanks to the partnership with California Sea Grant, the team will also have a chance to evaluate the feed&#8217;s performance in the real world through trials on fish farms. Anne Kapuscinski and Luke Gardner will co-lead this collaboration with a small group of trout farms in California. They&#8217;ll also recruit other leaders from across the aquaculture industry to learn more about low-polluting diets and build additional commercial interest.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled that this grant allows us to test our new diets on commercial trout farms,&#8221; Kapuscinski said. &#8220;The proof is in the pudding&#8212;or in this case, on the fish farm&#8212;so I think this will go a long way toward convincing more farmers and aquafeed manufacturers around the world to adopt low-polluting diets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research collaborators on the project will also model the economic feasibility of the new feed at scale. And a life cycle assessment will compare the overall environmental impact of the new formula with conventional feed&#8212;from the initial production of feed ingredients all the way through to the final fish fillet&#8212;across a wide range of impact categories including greenhouse gas and eutrophication emissions, water consumption, and biotic resource use.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker and Kapuscinski have been experimenting with recycled marine microalgal biomass as an alternative feed ingredient in part because they believe it has the potential to be more sustainable than conventional feed ingredients, like fish meal and fish oil or terrestrial crops, like corn, wheat, or soy. The life cycle assessment of their feed will provide valuable new insight into that question.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, as aquaculture grows to meet global protein needs, the team hopes continued research will ensure that the industry&#8217;s sustainability keeps growing alongside it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aquaculture has gotten a bad reputation with American consumers, and this slows down the progress of aquaculture,&#8221; Sarker said. &#8220;But impacts will likely continue to be reduced through research and innovations that find better ways to feed fish and help to encourage the best, most responsible practices in aquaculture.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6976b69b8072704647a15c512789cb13"><name>traffic-delays</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Traffic delays along McLaughlin Drive</title><summary>Construction crews will begin road maintenance work Monday, July 5, on McLaughlin Drive between the McLaughlin Drive / Heller Drive intersection to the bridge east of Science Hill, with an expected completion date of Friday, August 6.</summary><start-date>1625209200000</start-date><display-name>Traffic delays</display-name><path>/2021/07/traffic-delays</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/traffic-delays</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1625267025545</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1625267112516</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#160;</p>
<p>Construction crews will begin road maintenance work Monday, July 5, on McLaughlin Drive between the McLaughlin Drive / Heller Drive intersection to the bridge east of Science Hill, with an expected completion date of Friday, August 6. Work will include: removing two inches of the existing roadway and replacing with two inches of new asphalt, some areas receiving additional repairs via six-inch or twenty-four-inch dig-outs, installation of concrete pavement at the two bus pullouts near the Engineering Auditorium and Physical Sciences Building, and road restriping. Project information and access restrictions to be imposed by this project during the hours of 7 am to 5 pm are highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access through the work area for emergency services (police, fire, medical) will be maintained at all times.</li>
<li>Temporary traffic control signs will be in place along the project corridor.</li>
<li>Two-way traffic control will be in place throughout the duration of the project; however, drivers, cyclists and transit riders should expect up to five-minute delays in both directions while construction is underway.</li>
<li>Cyclists are strongly encouraged to use alternate routes during construction as the road surface will be less than optimal for bike traffic.</li>
<li>The two bus stops on McLaughlin Drive near the Engineering auditorium and Physical Sciences Building will be out of operation for the duration of the project; bus stops at Kresge College (on Heller Drive) and the Student Health Center (on McLaughlin Drive) will remain open and operational.</li>
<li>Parking Lot 138 (adjacent to the southwest corner of the Jack Baskin Engineering Building) will be used for construction staging and will not be available for the duration of the project.</li>
<li>Access to Parking Lot 139A (north of Engineering 2) will not be impacted and can be accessed via Heller Drive to Engineering Loop to Lot 139A. Additionally, some of the ParkMobile spots currently in Lot 138 will be relocated to Lot 139A.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, full road closures of this section of McLaughlin Drive will occur on Tuesday, July 6th, and Thursday, July 8th, to accommodate milling operations (July 6th) as well as dig-out and fill activities (July 8th). Further access restrictions in place during these full road closures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both lanes of traffic will be blocked. Vehicles and cyclists should avoid this section of McLaughlin Drive to the extent possible.</li>
<li>Access through the work area for emergency (police, fire, medical) will be possible during these closures.</li>
<li>Use the West Entrance to access west campus and use the Main Entrance to access east campus.</li>
<li>METRO service will be limited to selected stops on the east campus only.</li>
<li>Campus transit will service both west and east campus on shortened routes.</li>
<li>Loading dock access for critical deliveries for BioMed, ISB and E&amp;MS via Red Hill Road will be accommodated. The contractor will have traffic control personnel on-site to direct deliveries with possible minor delays. Contact the UCSC Project Manager (Marc Douvia) directly if there are issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, one final road closure is planned near the end of the project to facilitate repaving activities (Monday &amp; Tuesday, 7/26/21 and 7/27/21). However, repaving dates may change and are not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Finally, pedestrian access and crossings will be open during construction. As always, drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians are urged to use caution when traveling through the project corridor, especially when construction vehicles and/or workers are present.</p>
<p>We thank everyone in advance for their cooperation and patience as we make much-needed repairs to this section of McLaughlin Drive.</p>

<p><span>With the retirement of longtime RHP director Irene Reti, the Library has now re-envisioned the project to broaden its scope and will soon be launching a national search for a newly created position of Community Archivist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The new Community Archivist will continue to promote oral history as a means to capture the rich diversity of stories of the campus and region, with a particular focus on reaching out to traditionally under-represented communities. They will partner with the campus and community to develop and facilitate oral history projects, serving as a resource to those interested in using the methodology in their own research or in documenting the history of their own communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The Community Archivist will also seek out partnerships with community organizations and leaders to support the preservation of community history through other means, such as the establishment of formal archival collections and public history projects.</span></p>
<p><span>"I am so pleased to bring this position into the Library which will lead to the increased diversity of our collections and deepen our engagement with the campus and Santa Cruz County by offering tools and methodologies to collect stories and histories from all community members,&#8221; said University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell.</span></p>
<p><span>UCSC head of Special Collections &amp; Archives Teresa Mora noted that she was excited to continue the Library's commitment to oral history in a way that will foster partnerships with the broader community and engage with students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I see this as an opportunity to build upon the excellent work of the Regional History Project which has provided so many&#160;opportunities for student engagement over the years, seen most recently in the student-led oral history project,&#160;<a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/news/regional-history-project-releases-a-new-book-the-empty-year-an-oral-history-of-the-pandemics-of"><strong><em>The Empty Year</em></strong></a>, said Mora. &#8220;I look forward to lending our support to such important community-led collaborations as <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/manong-generation-oral-history.html"><em><strong>Watsonville is in the H</strong><strong>eart</strong></em></a> and to further identify opportunities to support our faculty and students in similar research.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Mora added that community archiving is a relatively recent trend within the archival profession that focuses on collaboration with community partners in an effort to allow community groups&#8212;often those who are traditionally underrepresented within formal archives&#8212;the agency to tell their own stories. Oral history is a powerful tool in many of these projects as tangible artifacts may no longer exist.</span></p>
<p><span>"The community archivist reflects the university's real commitment to elevating and amplifying local voices,&#8221; said UCSC associate professor of sociology Steven McKay, a lead researcher on the Watsonville project. &#8220;Our community partners are excited to share their perspectives and experiences that have generally been neglected or overlooked in local and Asian American history.&#160;We are equally excited to preserve and promote these important narratives and connect our partners with a professional archivist dedicated to the histories of the too-often unheard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>UCSC dean of humanities Jasmine Alinder added: &#8220;As a public historian myself, I am particularly excited to work with a new Community Archivist. This position and the Community Archives program will broaden our potential for impact, emphasizing community-engaged scholarship and the co-creation of knowledge."</span></p>
<p><span>Founded in 1963, the Regional History Project has been instrumental in documenting the history of both the campus and the community and has served as a training ground for students and faculty in the field of oral history. Projects have included student-led oral histories documenting the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake and the impact of Covid-19 on the UCSC Community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The program has actively engaged with the local community since its inception, publishing oral histories on topics such as the history of agriculture on the Central Coast and working closely with other local history groups to provide guidance in developing their own oral history projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Under the direction of Reti, the RHP produced more than 60 oral histories, documenting the history of both the campus and Santa Cruz County. Reti conducted oral histories with such notable local and campus figures as Sam Farr, Donna Haraway and George Blumenthal. She also edited the compendium oral history volumes, <i>Cultivating A Movement: An Oral History of Organic Farming and Sustainable Agriculture on California&#8217;s Central Coast</i> and <i>Out in the Redwoods: Documenting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender History at the University of California, Santa Cruz 1965-2003</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2020, Reti, with co-authors Sarah Rabkin and Cameron Vanderscoff, published S<i>eeds of Something Different: An Oral History of the University of California, Santa </i>Cruz, the first comprehensive history of UCSC.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81845df88072704647a15c512c194947"><name>exoplanet-hazes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Haziness of exoplanet atmospheres depends on properties of aerosol particles</title><summary>A laboratory study of haze particles produced under different conditions helps explain why some exoplanets may be obscured by hazy atmospheres.</summary><keywords>Xi Zhang, Xinting Yu</keywords><start-date>1626102000000</start-date><display-name>Haziness of exoplanet atmospheres depends on properties of aerosol particles</display-name><path>/2021/07/exoplanet-hazes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/exoplanet-hazes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1625670573540</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1626102379128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/07/images/xinting-yu-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/07/images/xinting-yu-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>xinting-yu-400.jpg</name><display-name>xinting-yu-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>78227</file-size><width>400</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Xinting Yu</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/07/images/xinting-yu-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/07/images/xinting-yu-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>xinting-yu-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>xinting-yu-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16779</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Xinting Yu</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Xinting Yu, a 51 Pegasi b Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSC, measured the properties of haze particles produced in the laboratory under conditions representative of exoplanet atmospheres.

A new study shows that haze particles produced under different conditions have a wide range of properties that can determine how clear or hazy a planet&#8217;s atmosphere is likely to be.</p>
<p>Photochemical reactions in the atmospheres of temperate exoplanets lead to the formation of small organic haze particles. Large amounts of these photochemical hazes form in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere every day, yet our planet has relatively clear skies. The reason has to do with how easily haze particles are removed from the atmosphere by deposition processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just haze production but also haze removal that determines how clear the atmosphere is,&#8221; said Xinting Yu, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01375-3">published July 12 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>
<p>Yu and her colleagues measured the properties of haze particles produced in the laboratory under conditions representative of exoplanet atmospheres, including a range of gas compositions, temperatures, and energy sources. Coauthor Xi Zhang, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said laboratory experiments like this are essential for understanding haze formation and its impact on observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t bring haze samples back from exoplanets, so we have to try to mimic the atmospheric conditions in the laboratory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Yu, haze removal depends on a critical material property of the particles called surface energy. &#8220;Surface energy describes how cohesive or &#8216;sticky&#8217; the material is,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Sticky haze particles readily bond with each other when they collide, growing into larger particles that fall out of the atmosphere onto the surface of the planet (a process called dry deposition). They also make good condensation nuclei for cloud droplets and are easily removed by wet deposition. Hazes produced on Earth typically have high surface energy and are therefore &#8216;sticky&#8217; and efficiently removed from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yu&#8217;s laboratory experiments show that the hazes produced in exoplanet atmospheres are highly diverse, with properties that depend on the conditions in which they are produced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them are similar to the Earth haze, have high surface energy, and are easy to remove, leading to clear skies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But some of them have very low surface energy, like a non-stick pan; they do not bond with other particles very well and remain as small particles hanging in the atmosphere for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study found that a critical factor is the temperature at which the haze particles are created. Hazes produced at around 400 Kelvin (260&#176;F) tended to have the lowest surface energies, leading to less efficient removal and hazier atmospheres. This finding actually corresponds with observed trends, Yu said, noting that exoplanets at temperatures of 400 to 500 K tend to be the haziest.</p>
<p>Cooler planets located in the habitable zones of their host stars are more likely to have clear atmospheres, she said. &#8220;We may not have to worry about habitable exoplanets being too hazy for future observations, as hazes tend to have higher surface energies at lower temperatures,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;So it is easy to remove these hazes, leaving relatively clear atmospheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>Astronomers are looking forward to having a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When an exoplanet transits across the face of its star, its atmosphere filters the light from the star, giving astronomers with a sensitive enough telescope (like JWST) an opportunity to identify the chemical components of the atmosphere using transmission spectroscopy.</p>
<p>A hazy atmosphere would interfere with transmission spectroscopy, but the hazes themselves may still yield valuable information, according to Zhang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hazes are not featureless,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With better telescopes, we may be able to characterize the composition of exoplanet hazes and understand their chemistry. But the observations will be very hard to explain without data from laboratory experiments. This study has revealed the huge diversity of haze particles, and understanding their optical properties will be a high priority for future studies.&#8221;</p>

The shifting ground stretches the river channels until the water breaks its courses and flows onto new paths.</p>
<p>In a study <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6551/204">published July 8 in <em>Science</em></a>, researchers at UC Santa Cruz created a model that helps predict this process. It provides broad context to how rivers and faults interact to shape the nearby topography.</p>
<p>The group originally planned to use the San Andreas fault in the Carrizo Plain of California to study how fault movement shapes the landscapes near rivers. But after spending hours poring over aerial imagery and remote topographic data, their understanding of how the terrain evolves began to change. They realized that rivers play a more active role in shaping the area than once thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rivers are their own little beasts, and they interact in really interesting ways with the kinematics and the motion along these faults,&#8221; said Kelian Dascher-Cousineau, seismology Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz and lead author on the study.</p>
<p>As the offset of a fault grows, it elongates river channels and slows the flow of water. With lower speeds, the river carries less sediment. The material builds up and eventually chokes the path, forcing the water to change course in a process known as avulsion.</p>
<p>This diversion happens rapidly, and the unexpected flooding can easily become destructive for nearby communities.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, geomorphologists have gained a clearer idea of how these avulsions happen in different types of rivers. But identifying long-term patterns in the way that rivers respond to fault movement still proves challenging.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really observe channels for thousands of years at a time,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau. To make up for that inability, the researchers used the well-studied past of the San Andreas Fault at the Carrizo Plain to test their model.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a history that we actually know really well from the earthquakes, and we can use that as a natural experiment to see what the channels are doing over these geomorphologically relevant timescales,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau.</p>
<p>The group closely examined images and maps of the Carrizo Plain and began testing complex models of river flow and sediment transport. They slowly removed variables, eventually identifying the most important elements in the system. The resulting model introduces a new framework for thinking about how rivers and active fault-lines interact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most seismologists typically have a view that the surface of the Earth is a passive thing that just responds to the faulting,&#8221; said Noah Finnegan, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and co-author on the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This paper embraced the fact that rivers are constantly changing and was able to show that the coevolution of the fault-offset and the river provides us with information that we weren't able to get previously,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You get a richer understanding of how the system works by recognizing that there&#8217;s an interesting coupling going on there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to predicting when fault-crossing rivers will abandon their original channels, the model can also help scientists estimate how quickly the sides of a fault are moving past one another&#8212;an important question to many seismologists that can be difficult to measure accurately.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know something about how the river works, you can get quantitative constraints on the rate of slip on the fault, which is something that is a common goal of studies of faults,&#8221; said Finnegan. &#8220;Alternatively, if you know something about the rate at which the fault is slipping, you can learn something about how efficient the river is at moving sediment, which is a basic question in almost every study of rivers and is almost impossible to know in a really accurate way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although it addresses complex questions, the model itself is surprisingly straightforward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like with a lot of discoveries, once you see it in the right way, there's incredible simplicity,&#8221; said Finnegan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never look at these landscapes in the same way again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group created the model while working entirely virtually&#8212;a challenge that Finnegan said inspired creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were forced to look at remote topographic data and aerial imagery that made us think in a more synoptic way about this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>How the model will fit different regions and the fault at a larger scale remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve outlined the set of physics that should operate in one range of conditions,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau. Next, they will turn their focus to new types of topography.</p>
<p>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, is also a coauthor of the paper, in addition to Dascher-Cousineau and Finnegan.

Hicken will be stepping into a role vacated by founding executive director Julie Barrett Heffington, who retired last year after 21 years of service.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The campus conducted a national search with the help of an external search firm, but found the new director in its own backyard. Hicken has lived in Santa Cruz with his family for over a decade, and his enthusiasm for the local community and his new role directing one of its most unique spaces is palpable. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;What excites me about the Seymour Center is that it is an institution that is already beloved and has enormous support in the the community, but that also has massive potential to grow in exciting ways and with new vibrancy,&#8221; Hicken says. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better situation to be walking into.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Hicken began his career as an academic researcher studying undocumented migration from Mexico to the United States. His work led to four published papers and a presentation before a congressional committee in Washington, D.C. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2011, Hicken pivoted to working for a tech startup, where he helped build and lead two teams of close to 50 people and was responsible for $20 million in sales. His experience growing teams, building sound business models, and understanding customer needs to provide better service led him to his next role as the director of development and partnerships for the Santa Cruz Museum of Art History (MAH). </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>From 2016 to 2019, Hicken led the MAH&#8217;s fundraising, marketing, and guest services departments through a period of explosive growth by increasing membership and donations and helping to create a popular new outdoor space for visitors to draw them to the museum. He is enthusiastic about bringing a similarly positive, community-driven experience to the Seymour Center to help fulfill its mission of getting community members of all ages excited about marine science and ocean conservation. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Our mission at the Seymour Center is to quench the public&#8217;s thirst for knowledge about the ocean and to grow a community that is passionately committed to ocean conservation,&#8221; said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, who oversees the Seymour Center. &#8220;In Jonathan, we found a director who can build on our strengths, but also lead us in exciting new directions with an even greater community focus.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>One of the Seymour Center&#8217;s goals is to expand its offerings to reach new audiences, while continuing to build on its strengths in K-8 education. Hicken was chosen for this role in part because of his years of experience growing groups and institutions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Hicken is also an accomplished fundraiser and since 2019 has worked to raise millions for the environment, outdoor recreation, and homelessness in the Santa Cruz community through Housing Matters and his own company, Giving Studio. He credits his success to his ability to create strong community partnerships.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, attended Hicken&#8217;s job talk and believes he has many unique assets that will benefit the Seymour Center and the UC Santa Cruz campus. &#8220;I believe Jonathan Hicken&#8217;s imagination, enthusiasm, communication skills, and fundraising and business experience make him a great choice to lead the Seymour Center into the future,&#8221; says Griggs. &#8220;He will bring new energy, creativity, and leadership to this much loved center.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Seymour Center is currently engaged in <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/seymour-center-visitor-experience.html">refreshing its exhibits and visitor experience</a>. Hicken will be responsible for guiding the Seymour Center into the next stage of its development and strategic planning as it prepares to reopen in late summer, and he is looking forward to getting started.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;What I most want people to know about me is that if they have any curiosity in or passion for the Seymour Center, I want to talk to them,&#8221; Hicken says. &#8220;I am taking a very deliberate approach to come in and listen. My main message to everyone is that I want you to be a part of this.

Though hundreds of teams from around the world applied to participate, Athena was one of only nine selected to compete in this year&#8217;s challenge and is one of five to advance to the finals.</p>
<p>Mentored by faculty advisor Marilyn Walker&#8212;a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and director of the department&#8217;s new Natural Language Processing (NLP) master&#8217;s program&#8212;the 11-member team includes a mix of undergraduate and graduate students from CSE, including five members of the inaugural NLP class. For those five, serving on Team Athena allows them to compete in the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge while also fulfilling the NLP program&#8217;s capstone project requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The capstone project is an opportunity to do a substantial team research project over three quarters to develop practical skills in the field of natural language processing,&#8221; said Walker, who has mentored the team all four years in which it competed, including when the team was known as SlugBot in 2017 and 2018. &#8220;The Alexa Socialbot Grand Challenge gives the NLP students an opportunity to try out their research ideas in a real time system that interacts in conversation with thousands of human users.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the other six members of Team Athena&#8212;a mix of undergraduate and graduate students in other CSE degree programs who work in Walker&#8217;s Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab&#8212;competing in the Socialbot Grand Challenge provides an opportunity to gain valuable experience solving real-world problems in the fields of natural language processing and conversational AI.</p>
<p>The Socialbot Grand Challenge tasks teams to build a socialbot capable of carrying out 20-minute coherent and engaging conversations on various current events and popular topics with users of Alexa-enabled devices. Amazon provides each team a $250,000 research grant, Alexa-enabled devices, and free Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing services to support their research and development efforts.</p>
<p>The competition began November 9, 2020, when the socialbots were released into the Alexa ecosystem. One socialbot is chosen at random for testing when a user of an Alexa-enabled device says, &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s chat.&#8221; Once the conversation concludes, the user gets the chance to give a verbal rating of the socialbot&#8217;s performance and provide feedback, which is sent anonymously to the socialbot&#8217;s team. The team also receives a transcript of the conversation.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell a lot from the conversations with users, especially things that aren&#8217;t working,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>The capstone project for the five NLP students on Team Athena aims to improve conversational AI by making it better at understanding a key facet of human language that the technology has historically had trouble with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally the socialbot did not have the capabilities of understanding different pronouns, so the NLP capstone team has been working on their own encapsulated project to develop new approaches to address this issue," said Walker.</p>
<p>Through the use of coreference resolution algorithms&#8212;the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text&#8212;the NLP capstone team is developing a conversational model capable of capturing pronoun context. This approach aims to solve a language comprehension problem with socialbots, which may seem trivial to humans, but has been proven to be a major stumbling block for conversational AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;We noticed if we don&#8217;t provide context to different pronouns, our system won&#8217;t necessarily know how to continue the conversation, so we might lose out on a potential positive interaction by responding with information unrelated to what the user is talking about,&#8221; said NLP student Angela Ramirez. &#8220;This led us to focus on using coreference resolution to resolve ambiguous pronouns that exist in the user&#8217;s utterances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez and NLP team member Cecilia Li have both been working on the capstone project and Athena system. They often work closely together in reviewing edge cases&#8212;major issues that arise within the system that impact user experience&#8212;and annotating data, when needed, to improve the socialbot&#8217;s ability to understand pronoun context in edge cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned that interacting with users in a live system is usually far less predictable than textbook exercises,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;With Alexa Prize being an open-ended project, not only do we need to establish the problem on the fly and choose the correct tools to solve them, we also need to design the process every step of the way as we proceed. Understanding and learning NLP in this unique environment is truly an experience that will benefit us in our future careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>All five NLP students have been consistently working in tandem with the other six members of Team Athena, splitting up tasks, completing weekly goals, and finding innovative ways to improve the socialbot so they have a strong chance of placing in the top three of this year&#8217;s challenge.</p>
<p>Amazon Alexa Socialbot Grand Challenge winners will be announced in August 2021. Monetary prizes will be awarded to the top three teams.

<p>The high-throughput screening facility helps scientists make discoveries about novel compounds. The center opened in 2007 and still has most of its original equipment. The new grant will pay for state-of-the-art instrumentation and automate more of the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of exciting results,&#8221; said Scott Lokey, the Chemical Screening Center&#8217;s director and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;But then the instrumentation ran its course and aged beyond its useful lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the center, researchers isolate targets&#8212;such as a type of cancer cell or bacterium&#8212;into tiny individual containers and treat each one with a different compound. They do this with thousands to hundreds-of-thousands of compounds, looking for interesting interactions.</p>
<p>Scientists make note of the compounds that react with the target in a significant way and study them further. Eventually, promising compounds might become new treatments for diseases.</p>
<h4>Frozen libraries</h4>
<p>UC Santa Cruz houses enormous frozen libraries of compounds. These include a 100,000-member small molecule library provided as part of UCSC&#8217;s institutional commitment, a 376,000-member library from the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Program for Natural Product Discovery, an in-house collection of 15,000 natural product extracts, and a library of 2,500 &#8220;known bioactives&#8221; and FDA-approved drugs.</p>
<p>The two main goals for the new NIH grant are improving instrument reliability and increasing user access and collaborations at the facility.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers work with 384 samples at a time. But they need to screen thousands or more to maximize their chances of finding something useful. With the new liquid handling instrumentation, scientists will be able to screen 1,536 samples at a time, all in a plate around the size of a cell phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can now screen 100,000 compounds in a day,&#8221; said Lokey. &#8220;Whereas, it would have taken several weeks to do that with our old instrumentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new system will also save resources. Previously, scientists had to have more target material than what was technically necessary due to how the liquid handling system collected droplets. A new echo acoustic dispenser will use sound waves to dispense a tiny amount of material&#8212;just a few nanoliters, invisible to the naked eye&#8212; and only the exact volume needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It's going to allow our natural products resource to last probably 10 years longer than it would have if we had kept doing it the traditional way,&#8221; said John MacMillan, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and associate vice chancellor for research at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;To replenish that as a resource is not only very costly, but it's also very time-intensive,&#8221; said MacMillan, who frequently works with bacteria from the ocean.</p>
<p>Several of the researchers who use the facilities face similar challenges. For example, Melissa Jurica, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, studies RNA splicing and screens compounds in nuclear cell extracts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It's really hard to make even a milliliter of nuclear extract,&#8221; said Lokey. &#8220;Before, it would take her lab many, many weeks to get enough material just to screen a few thousand compounds. But now, in that same period of time, she can screen tens of thousands because of the decreased volume.&#8221;</p>
<p>More of the sampling and screening will be robotic, so researchers can program and calibrate the instruments then step back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You let it run overnight, and you&#8217;ve done 100,000 compounds,&#8221; said Lokey.</p>
<h4>Screening microscope</h4>
<p>The center will also gain a high-content screening microscope. The powerful tool can image live cells in organoids&#8212;3-dimensional clusters of cells that function like miniature organs.</p>
<p>This ability will open the door for additional types of research projects, such as efforts led by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UCSC Genomics Institute, to understand the human brain using organoids.</p>
<p>The chemical screening center&#8217;s new capabilities will likely also increase collaborations across campus and beyond. With less time and material required to screen compounds, more researchers can access the center.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of faculty members who are pushing the limits on understanding biological systems in a way that might lead to novel therapeutic targets,&#8221; said MacMillan. &#8220;But up until this point in time, very few people on our campus have been able to then take that and make a leap from that basic biological discovery to some sort of a translational benefit. I think the new instrumentation and upgrades to this facility are going to open up a whole new arena for those faculty members.&#8221;</p>
<p>The high-throughput screening center could play a particularly important role in finding treatments for tropical and neglected diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big drug companies aren't highly motivated to go after these diseases, because there's just not a market,&#8221; said Lokey. &#8220;That's where academic screening centers can step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>That mission fits well with the university&#8217;s <span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/sparke-health.html">new global and community health program</a></span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chemical Screening Center is going to be that very critical bridge between understanding the infectious disease and being able to come up with therapies,&#8221; said MacMillan. &#8220;I think it will be transformational for the campus.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a24be146807270466cc00b005c70c5f4"><name>precarity-and-belonging</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>‘Precarity &amp;

Belonging</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that culminates more than five years of collaborative research and discussion around themes of global migration, citizenship, and marginalization.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project started in the spring of 2016, when Latin American and Latino Studies Professor Catherine Ram&#237;rez organized a series of events called &#8220;Borders and Belonging&#8221; to convene experts on migration from across campus and around the world. From there, the conversation continued into the fall of 2016 and through the spring of 2017, thanks to a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that allowed UC Santa Cruz to host a Sawyer Seminar series of events on forced migration, labor, and citizenship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Precarity and Belonging </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">captures insights that emerged from those gatherings. Ram&#237;rez collaborated with Associate Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, Professor of Literature Juan Poblete, Associate Professor of Sociology Steve McKay, and Professor of Feminist Studies Felicity Amaya Schaeffer to co-edit a volume featuring 23 contributors from around the world. Ram&#237;rez, Poblete, and Schaeffer also contributed chapters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ultimately, our book is about mobility and immobility, and by mobility, we refer to both physical movement and movement along socioeconomic lines,&#8221; Ram&#237;rez said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precarity and Belonging</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores these themes in connection to three interrelated concepts: migration, the legal and social elements of belonging, and precarity, which is a measure of socioeconomic vulnerability and risk. Associate Professor of Sociology Steve McKay says the term precarity originated in Europe to describe rising unemployment and inadequate, shrinking social safety nets.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In some ways, Europe was just catching up to the rest of the world, where that has been the state of things for a very long time,&#8221; McKay said. &#8220;Unfortunately, precarity has become more and more common, both as a theoretical framework and as a lived experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precarity and Belonging</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a global look at this concept, including a focus on the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we talk about the American Dream, it&#8217;s often celebrated as upward mobility: the &#8216;rags to riches&#8217; story,&#8221; Ram&#237;rez said. &#8220;But what we&#8217;re actually seeing in this country, and what we&#8217;ve been seeing for decades, is decreasing wealth among the majority and downward mobility along many different indices of well-being, health, and wealth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book&#8217;s authors particularly wanted to illustrate how precarity affects people across citizenship statuses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a spectrum of precarity and belonging that connects people who have very little formal claim on the status of citizenship with people whose full claims to the status have been devalued by changing economic conditions, globalization, politics, and racism,&#8221; said Literature Professor Juan Poblete. &#8220;That includes undocumented workers as well as a blue-collar white citizen who has been laid off by a big plant that disappears in the Midwest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram&#237;rez explained that traditional notions of citizenship and belonging focus on &#8220;the people who are fully participating in society and its institutions: those who serve on juries and vote and own their homes.&#8221; But for many U.S. citizens, economic participation in institutions like homeownership is increasingly unattainable. Meanwhile, legal rights&#8212;like the right to vote&#8212;can be denied to citizens who have been incarcerated, or who simply live in states that have made it more difficult to vote, for example. And institutionalized prejudice has long eroded the legal, social, and economic rights of Americans on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and many other factors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We end up with this gradation of citizenship and belonging, where you have some people who experience full citizenship, while others are treated as denizens who live in a place but are basically second-class citizens or extremely well-integrated non-citizens,&#8221; Ram&#237;rez said. &#8220;And then you have the &#8216;alien&#8217; or outsider who is seen as an interloper.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precarity and Belonging </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sheds new light on the degradation of citizenship while emphasizing shared precarity in order to drive toward a new &#8220;politics of commonality.&#8221; The book envisions a future in which people work together to dismantle barriers across the spectrum of belonging while improving quality of life for all.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can seem almost paradoxical to try to bring some of these groups together, because it has been so extraordinarily effective for politicians to pit them against each other,&#8221; said Poblete. &#8220;But the basis of the politics of commonality is the fact that your destiny is tied to solving all the problems that also affect these other people. Because without that, there will be no social peace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precarity and Belonging</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can&#8217;t offer all the answers on what it would take to achieve a politics of commonality, but the book&#8217;s coeditors believe that inviting global discussion on that topic is an essential step forward. And they&#8217;re proud to have positioned the university as a convener in those efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting because I think UC Santa Cruz does something unusual in that we often have multidisciplinary approaches to large systemic problems,&#8221; McKay said. &#8220;It&#8217;s that kind of broad thinking and bringing together of people&#8212;not just from different disciplines, but also from all over the world&#8212;that makes this book a uniquely UC Santa Cruz project.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>The award supports Zhao&#8217;s research with physics professor Bruce Schumm at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). Zhao is working on the development of low-gain avalanche diode silicon detectors, which feature excellent timing resolution for measuring particle interactions. Specifically, the award is for the further development of the "deep junction" low-gain avalanche detector, for which Zhao holds intellectual property rights, along with Schumm, postdoctoral fellow Simone Mazza, and fellow graduate student Carolyn Gee.</p>
<p>These detectors have applications in particle physics experiments and accelerator beam monitoring. SCIPP is an international leader in the development of silicon detectors for high-energy physics experiments and other applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;This award is a wonderful acknowledgement of Yuzhan&#8217;s accomplishments in instrumentation,&#8221; Schumm said.</p>
<p>The GIRA program aims to encourage and facilitate greater involvement of physics graduate students in significant instrumentation development, to boost recognition of instrumentation work as a vital part of PhD training, to foster the growth of future high-energy physics instrumentation experts in the United States, and to strengthen university-lab ties on instrumentation development. GIRA was established by the Coordination Panel for Advanced Detectors, a standing committee of the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aacc8d13807270466cc00b00a37d4fc2"><name>interim-diversity-officer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Judith Estrada named interim Chief Diversity Officer</title><summary>We are pleased to announce that Dr. Judith Estrada has agreed to serve as our interim Chief Diversity Officer while also taking on a new role as Executive Director of our Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</summary><start-date>1626246000000</start-date><display-name>Judith Estrada named interim Chief Diversity Officer</display-name><path>/2021/07/interim-diversity-officer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/interim-diversity-officer</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1626363170046</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1626363170046</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce that Dr. Judith Estrada has agreed to serve as our interim Chief Diversity Officer while also taking on a new role as Executive Director of our Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>
<p>Judith has been a vocal advocate for creating a more welcoming, just, and inclusive campus since her arrival at UC Santa Cruz eight years ago. She served seven years as director of El Centro, our Chicanx Latinx Resource Center, before accepting the role of Complaint Resolution Officer for Title IX in the Equity &amp; Equal Protection Office last summer. She also has served as interim director of our Women&#8217;s Center.</p>
<p>Executive Director of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a new position for our campus, and I am delighted to have Judith in this role, as well as serving as our interim Chief Diversity Officer. She is a collaborative leader who, among other things, was instrumental in establishing the regional family conferences that are a valuable part of our HSI initiatives. Joining Judith to support this work will be Asia Valdivia in the role of Special Assistant for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Project Manager. Asia has been with UC Santa Cruz since 2016, working most recently as interim Assistant Dean of Students, Strategic Initiatives and Policy Analysis. Before that, she served as project manager in Student Achievement and Equity Innovation in the Division of Student Affairs and Success, where she built key relationships and worked across campus in support of many initiatives, including HSI.</p>
<p>Strengthening and broadening our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are critical for the success of our campus. The benefits are many, including a positive campus climate, improved racial and cultural awareness, enhanced critical thinking, and of course equitable access to higher education. I am excited to share that we will soon begin a nationwide recruitment for our first Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, a role that encompasses serving as our Chief Diversity Officer. This new leader will work collaboratively with leadership campuswide to guide our efforts to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, and proactively build a more inclusive climate. The position will report directly to the chancellor and oversee our Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI).</p>
<p>The ODEI is charged with advancing diversity, equity and inclusion campuswide, and is complementary to our Equity and Equal Protection Office (EEP), which is responsible for compliance work and the administration of campus policies and procedures regarding discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>Over the coming academic year, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion aims to make progress on a number of fronts. Among them is being more proactive on campus-climate issues, focusing less on conflict resolution and &#8220;after-the-fact&#8221; training. The office will also strengthen its network of campus partners, operating under the philosophy that real change requires campuswide collaboration. Developing foundational materials to support strategic efforts and communicating more about DEI initiatives with our community are also critical goals for the year ahead.</p>
<p>I would like to thank our prior chief diversity officer, Dr. Teresa Maria Linda Scholz, for her work to foster a healthy campus climate where all students, staff, and faculty are seen, valued, and respected. Linda was named New Mexico State University&#8217;s first-ever vice president for equity, inclusion and diversity this spring. Her last day with UCSC was July 6.</p>

TAs also play an important role in classroom success for undergraduate students, as a new statistical analysis shows.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity among graduate student teaching assistants (TAs) may be among the most essential factors in retaining underrepresented minority undergraduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, according to statistical evidence from a new study set to publish in the August issue of the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775721000443"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics of Education Review</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team of economists and chemists at UC Santa Cruz gathered and analyzed data from more than 4,000 students in general chemistry labs at the university over a five-year period to show that&#8212;among undergraduate students who were Latinx, Black, Native American, Native Alaskan or Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander&#8212;course drop rates decreased from 6 percent to 0.5 percent, and pass rates increased from 93.6 percent to 98.4 percent when these students were assigned a TA who was also a member of a racial or ethnic minority group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are just not that many interventions that make that much of a difference in education,&#8221; said Economics Professor Rob Fairlie, the senior author on the paper. &#8220;I thought we would find something, but I was surprised that the effect was so big.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study controlled for variability in individual teaching and learning abilities and also found no effect of TA-student pairings on course grades. This led the paper&#8217;s authors to conclude that the large demonstrated changes in drop and pass rates likely result from how TA-student interactions influence a student&#8217;s decision of whether or not to stick with a course.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One huge implication of this study is that sometimes people question whether the instructor or TA can alter student decisions, and I think we clearly document that,&#8221; said Daniel Oliver, lead author of the paper who is now a senior research fellow at Tulane University. Oliver worked on the study while completing his Ph.D. in economics at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Statistics aligned with lived experience</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant trend driving the paper&#8217;s results was specifically how Latinx students benefited from having a TA of the same ethnic background. David Delgadillo, a graduate student and former TA in the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at UCSC, said he has felt a sense of validation from the study&#8217;s findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, being Latino in STEM and having gone through the process as a student myself and then transitioning into that teaching role, I can say that I think it's easy to be intimidated in these courses, especially if you don't have family members or friends that have gone through the process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But with TAs, that first initial interaction with somebody that you feel represents you or represents a struggle that you've gone through really lowers the entry barrier into being a successful student in these classes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a TA, Delgadillo said that he always worked hard to create a welcoming environment in the classroom and to boost student confidence because he understood how much pressure students might be under, particularly if they came from marginalized communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's this extra level of stress and this thought process of &#8216;I need to perform well and do everything perfectly, or my one opportunity to move up the social ladder is done,&#8217; and that&#8217;s the complex that you can sometimes go into it with as a student,&#8221; Delgadillo said. &#8220;I think what really helps is being welcomed into that course by somebody who can understand that sense of pressure. Someone who lets you know that it's okay and that you&#8217;re going to make mistakes and struggle a little bit, but if you keep going and keep pushing, you'll eventually persevere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new paper demonstrates how economists can contribute to conversations around these issues by helping to quantify the impacts of what students and TAs are experiencing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As economists, our training is to do statistical work with these big data sets and carefully set up analyses that can affirm many personal stories in chemistry and the sciences,&#8221; said Rob Fairlie. &#8220;And our interest is in trying to create equity.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Insights for breaking down barriers&#160;</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics from the National Science Foundation in 2015 showed that, while Latinx, Black, Native American, Native Alaskan or Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people represented 26 percent of the U.S. adult population, people from these groups collectively accounted for about 13 percent of the nation&#8217;s highest degree holders in science and engineering and made up 10 percent of the workforce in related fields. These disparities in representation can have profound economic impacts, since careers in science and engineering tend to be higher-paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Millhauser, a distinguished professor and chair of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at UCSC, said he hopes the new study&#8217;s results will help higher education institutions provide better support for students from minority communities who are entering science-based fields. Millhauser was a coauthor on the paper, along with chemistry lecturer Randa Roland, and both helped to design the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to provide a meaningful sense of inclusion, along with instruction that leads to real success, so that students feel part of the STEM community and are provided with the tools for more advanced studies and degrees,&#8221; Millhauser said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new paper indicates that one way universities can help to break down barriers to entry in STEM fields is through continued improvements in recruiting and support for graduate student instructors and faculty from diverse backgrounds. And, ultimately, all instructors, regardless of their ethnic or racial backgrounds, must be accountable for understanding and adapting to the needs of their students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&#8217;Lester Allen, a doctoral candidate in physical chemistry who has been a TA for general chemistry and other courses, said he would love to see increased representation among professors, graduate students, and staff. However, he says it&#8217;s also important to ensure that the responsibility for student success is not placed disproportionately upon instructors from minority communities.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think what needs to happen is a little soul-searching by everyone to build an understanding of what it's like from the perspective of historically disadvantaged students coming into these classes, so that the instructors can see all of the barriers in the way that students see them,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;Maybe then those barriers can be removed.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>This new policy is intended to support the health and well-being of our university community including students, trainees, faculty, staff and all others who work, live or learn in any of our locations or participate in person in our programs. If you have yet to receive your vaccine, we encourage you to do so promptly &#8212; several <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626541139866000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTyFk59cva1PVOBhK0dneLjnVlSQ" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convenient options</a> are available for you. Vaccine information is also available on our Student Health Center <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html%23schedule&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626541139866000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXxqIFLz3M3h3YZaCWhhf4HpQJeQ" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#schedule" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>The systemwide policy requires employees and students to provide proof of vaccination or to request an exception or deferral based on a medical condition, religious belief, disability or pregnancy prior to the start of fall instruction. Beginning today, UC Santa Cruz students and employees can provide proof of vaccination online via the campus health <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626541139866000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH28ZNoUCn99NOu1WYtA0Avcl8rWw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">portal</a>. Instructions on the process are below. If you received your vaccine through the Student Health Center, we already have that record, and you do not need to provide proof.</p>
<p>Employees and students will need to upload proof of vaccination by Sept. 9. We will be sending out instructions next week on the process that will be used for requesting an exemption.</p>
<h3>Steps to take if you have been vaccinated</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you have already been vaccinated at UC Santa Cruz, we have a record of that vaccination and no further proof is required of you. If you would like to review your vaccination records, log into the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626541139866000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH28ZNoUCn99NOu1WYtA0Avcl8rWw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health e-Messenger</a> system and select the Immunization History link on the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you received a COVID-19 vaccination elsewhere, you must submit proof of vaccination by using our campus Health e-Messenger system, which is managed by Student Health Services. The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626541139866000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH28ZNoUCn99NOu1WYtA0Avcl8rWw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health e-Messenger system</a>, which meets the stringent requirements for maintaining the security of medical records, has been serving our student population for many years, and has now been expanded to take in and maintain employee proof of vaccination.</p>

<p><span>Her article, &#8220;The Trials of Mary Booth and the Post-Civil War Incarceration of African American Children,&#8221; appeared in the September 2020 issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Drawn from a limited archival record, Jones&#8217;s essay examines the wrongful 1882 murder conviction of Mary Booth, a 14-year-old African American girl in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span>It shows how African American children were transformed into carceral subjects following emancipation and how, in response, Black Virginians fought for greater access to the justice system and for juvenile justice reform.</span></p>
<p><span>The prize committee noted that &#8220;Jones overcame the fragmentary documentary record to write a compelling narrative about a black girl caught in an unpredictable, often brutal, legal system. The author handled the complex legal maneuvers with skill, without ever losing sight of the human dimension of the story. The essay gives us new ways to think about freedom and unfreedom in the postwar South, and it illuminates new aspects of the history of childhood, African Americans, and women.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Jones previously won the Grace Abbot Prize for best book on the history of children published in 2015 from the Society for the History of Children and Youth. She earned the award for her book, <i>Intimate Reconstructions: Children in Postemancipation Virginia</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>Jones joined the humanities faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2007 and received UCSC&#8217;s John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities in 2015. She is currently working on a book about the history of child incarceration in the post&#8211;Civil War era.</span></p>
<p><span>Published by UNC Press, <i>The Journal of the Civil War Era </i>explores how knowledge of the Civil War era informs our understanding of 21st-century politics and society.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>It's mission is to publish "the most creative new work on the many issues raised by slavery, the sectional crisis, war, emancipation, Reconstruction, and memory of the country&#8217;s signal conflict, while bringing fresh understanding to the struggles that defined the period, and by extension, the course of American history in the 19th century.&#8221;</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf7eb2ff807270466cc00b00e63bf6db"><name>fall-admissions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz admits fall class that reflects excellence, diversity </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz anticipates welcoming about 6,100 new Banana Slugs this fall, concluding an admissions cycle that began with record applications and has yielded a new cohort that reflects the campus commitment to excellence, equity, and opportunity.&#13;

<p>After receiving more than 74,000 undergraduate applications for fall 2021, staff and faculty leaders worked closely to determine who would be offered admission for the upcoming academic year. The incoming class is both academically distinguished and diverse. The cohort has a mean weighted high school GPA of 3.99 and includes many students who are from low-income families and will be the first in their families to earn a four-year degree.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The transfer students in the Class of 2023 and first-year students in the Class of 2025 have shown themselves to be well-prepared, determined and resilient scholars,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;We are so excited to welcome them to our campus community to continue their academic journey.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s newest cohort joins a university already on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty pursuing research that is having a transformative impact on society. Reflecting the quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching, UCSC recently joined the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz shares the distinction of being the youngest member of the esteemed 66-member AAU, and is one of only four members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution. The campus also is an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. For the second year in a row, UC Santa Cruz was ranked among the top-five universities nationally for student social mobility.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz experience a small liberal arts college environment with the depth and rigor of a major research university through the pairing of high-impact research with 10 tight-knit residential colleges&#8212;a rare combination among U.S. public universities.&#160;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, UC Santa Cruz was <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/princeton-review.html">named the No. 3 public university in the nation for students focused on making an impact on the world</a>, according to Princeton Review. This ranking reinforces what students and alumni know: that UC Santa Cruz is the ideal place for individuals seeking to have an impact on society and to effect real change.</p>
<h2>Advancing opportunity, access</h2>
<p>In the midst of the worldwide pandemic, the campus admissions team expanded its virtual outreach efforts in high schools&#160; and community colleges to ensure students knew about the transformational opportunities available at UC Santa Cruz. With a record number of applications, the faculty committee carefully assessed how to provide access to a high-quality and affordable UC education to a diverse cohort of highly qualified students.&#160;</p>
<p>For fall 2021, UC Santa Cruz extended an <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/ug-data.html">offer of admissions</a> to 36,375 high school seniors and 7,707 transfer students. More than 26,000 of those seniors were from California and more than 6,900 transfer students were from California community colleges.</p>
<p>The racial and ethnic diversity of admitted students increased this year. UC Santa Cruz extended admissions offers to 1,186 African American high school seniors from California, an 8 percent increase over the previous year. Offers to Chicanx/Latinx first-year students increased by 10 percent.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz continued its regional and statewide outreach efforts virtually to increase interest and applications from transfer students who are seeking a four-year degree. Having already completed substantial coursework, transfer students have demonstrated their ability to succeed academically, enter UCSC poised for timely graduation, and add valuable perspectives to its community of scholars. Providing access for California community college students further diversifies the campus community.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz takes pride in creating a learning environment that supports cultural and geographic diversity. In support of that, the campus admitted 4,380 international first-year students and 5,167 first-year students from other states.</p>
<p>The broad diversity California, international, and out-of-state first-year and transfer students bring to campus enhances the community through their varied experiences and perspectives and helps prepare students for successful careers in a global environment.</p>
<h2>Preparing for fall quarter</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is planning to return to predominantly in-person learning this fall, though students who need to stay remote will be able to continue working toward their degree. Planning is underway for winter quarter, which will provide even more in-person experiences, as long as the vaccines continue to be effective against COVID-19 variants. Plans are subject to change pursuant to guidance and directives from federal, state and local health officials.</p>
<p>Fall instruction begins Sept. 23 with move-in starting Sept. 16. The campus will provide housing for about 9,300 students, more than half of the undergraduate class.</p>
<p>Incoming frosh and sophomore students will participate in a robust Welcome Week intended to connect and engage students with each other and the campus. Required Welcome Week sessions will be offered virtually, and optional sessions will be offered both virtually and in-person. Welcome Week is a continuation of the Slug Orientation online courses, and is designed to further introduce new students to vital resources that will support them in their academic and social transition to the university.&#160;</p>
<p>Through the required college and major advising presentations, new students will meet staff and faculty from their affiliated college and major. During this week students will have many opportunities to meet other students, learn about student clubs and organizations, and attend workshops that will connect them to work and internship opportunities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4a3b164807270466cc00b0066747a2f"><name>blue-cross-contract-termination</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC PPO plans impacted by Anthem Blue Cross-Dignity Health contract termination Inbox</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz learned on Friday that the contract between Anthem Blue Cross, the insurance carrier of UC's commercial PPO plans (non-Medicare plans), and Dignity Health, a health care provider which includes Dominican Hospital-Santa Cruz, ended, effective July 15.</summary><start-date>1626764400000</start-date><display-name>UC PPO plans impacted by Anthem Blue Cross-Dignity Health contract termination Inbox</display-name><path>/2021/07/blue-cross-contract-termination</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/blue-cross-contract-termination</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1626796699981</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1626796699981</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz learned on Friday that the contract between Anthem Blue Cross, the insurance carrier of UC's commercial PPO plans (non-Medicare plans), and Dignity Health, a health care provider which includes Dominican Hospital-Santa Cruz, ended, effective July 15.</p>
<p>This contract termination affects members of the following UC PPO plans: UC Care, Health Savings Plan, and CORE. This contract termination is deeply disappointing news, especially in the midst of a continuing pandemic.</p>
<p>We recognize that this contract termination and the resulting uncertainty of when a resolution might be reached has significant impacts on many members of our campus community and their families. We remain hopeful that Anthem and Dignity will come to agreement on mutually beneficial terms. UCSC leadership is working closely with the UC Office of the President, which manages the systemwide benefits program, to develop guidance for affected UC PPO members.</p>
<p>We will provide ongoing communications on this evolving situation as new information becomes available. Please contact the UCSC Benefits Office at <a href="mailto:benefits@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">benefits@ucsc.edu</a> to opt-in to communications and to ask additional questions. Staff Human Resources is developing a page with answers to frequently asked questions that will be published at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://shr.ucsc.edu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626881725922000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH30Wsno5NIuECGPHASv9Fa8SUl4g" href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shr.ucsc.edu</a> later this week.</p>
<h2>If you are a member of an Anthem PPO plan and receive care from Dignity Health Providers after July 15, 2021</h2>
<p>Members of UC PPO plans who receive care from Dignity Health and Dominican Hospital after 5 p.m. July 15, 2021 should note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims for services received will be processed at the out-of-network coverage tier.</li>
<li>Annual deductible amounts are higher for out-of-network care.</li>
<li>Higher out-of-network co-insurance rates, except for services pre-approved under the continuity of care rules described below, will be the patient's responsibility.</li>
<li>The patient may be responsible for the balance of costs above the allowed amount for care received from non-network providers.</li>
<li>Emergency medical services do not require pre-authorization regardless of where services are delivered. Members may go to any hospital for emergency services, including Dignity Health.</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you are currently receiving care</h2>
<p>Under California's continuity of care rules, some Dignity/Dominican-Santa Cruz patients may continue to receive limited care from Dignity Health providers. Continuity of care must be requested by the member and is subject to approval by the medical plan. Anthem Blue Cross, at the enrollee's request, must provide for the completion of covered services as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an acute condition</li>
<li>For a serious chronic condition</li>
<li>For the duration of a pregnancy</li>
<li>For the duration of a terminal illness</li>
<li>For the care of children between birth and 36 months</li>
<li>For surgery (or other procedures) that have been authorized by the plan or its delegated provider and is scheduled to occur within 180 days of the contract's termination date</li>
</ul>
<p>To request continuity of care, patients should call the health plan number on the back of their UC PPO plan member ID cards.</p>
<p>You can find summaries of in-network and out-of-network summary charts linked below.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor, who turns 21 on July 22, is a member of Team USA&#8217;s rhythmic gymnastics group, a five-member squad whose sport combines elements of dance and gymnastics with equipment like hoops, balls, ribbons, and clubs in heart-stopping routines. Hoops fly through the air to land on outstretched legs. Balls spin from teammate to teammate as the group moves in a perfectly choreographed routine. It&#8217;s a sport that requires hand-eye coordination, agility, stamina, and focus. Until now, U.S. athletes have never qualified for all three Olympic rhythmic gymnastics berths: two individual and one group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is definitely an historic year for us,&#8221; Connor said by phone from the Lake Placid Olympic Center where she and her teammates were practicing before heading off to Israel for the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix competition and then on to the Olympics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her achievement, however, did not come easily. Not only did Connor spend years training&#8212;even leaving her Manhattan Beach, Calif., home her senior year of high school in order to practice at the North Shore Rhythmic Gymnastics Center in Deerfield, Ill.&#8212;she also had to refocus her goals after the 2020 Olympics were postponed because of the pandemic. In addition, in 2018, she faced a bout of severe anxiety and subsequent depression that forced her to rediscover her love for her career.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I strongly believe you don&#8217;t fully start to know yourself or grow as a person until you&#8217;ve gone through something that breaks you,&#8221; Connor said of that time. &#8220;That&#8217;s when you start to grow and progress as a person.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned her pain into power, she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Connor, she got a relatively late start in her sport. She dabbled in rhythmic gymnastics when she was 8 and then, drawn by its focus on artistry and dance, returned to the sport at age 10. It soon became her passion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She never considered going to the Olympics, however.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought it was too much pressure. I was very insecure and anxious as a kid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I never allowed myself to dream big.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, she set small goals. The small goals, however, turned into big achievements and, at 17, she was asked to join the USA&#8217;s group national team and moved to Illinois to train. In 2018, however, she was hit suddenly with intense anxiety and panic attacks.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor struggled silently for a while and then, taking inspiration from decorated swimmer Michael Phelps, who has spoken openly about his depression, and also from four-time Olympic gold-medalist, gymnast Simone Biles, who has said regular visits to a psychiatrist and self-care helped ease her own anxiety, Connor decided to step out into the open and treat her anxiety like an injury that needed work to heal. She told her coach and her teammates of her struggles&#8212;they were very supportive, she said&#8212;and was able to find techniques that worked for her. Today, she considers herself healed and stronger than before.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, against the odds, the U.S. rhythmic gymnastics group secured a spot in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, only to face disappointment when the games were postponed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, however, Connor is heading toward Tokyo with the aim of helping the U.S. team succeed and is feeling good. When the games are over, she said, she plans to retire from her sport and take her spot at UC Santa Cruz, where she will study astrophysics at a campus she described as beautiful and peaceful. There, she said, she will also follow her second passion, which is writing. She hopes to pen articles about her experiences throughout her career as well as mental health advocacy as a way to help others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though we sometimes seem superhuman, we athletes are human and experience the same emotions and struggles that everyone else does,&#8221; Connor said. &#8220;The important thing is that things such as anxiety and depression don&#8217;t need to stop you from doing what you dream about or define you. They should be normalized and addressed accordingly.&#8221;</span></p>

assistant film and digital media professor Susana Ruiz has received a 2021 Digital Extension Grant of $150,000 from The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) for her project, <i>Arab Data Bodies: Social Media in Mixed Reality</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The Digital Extension Grant program supports collaborative, team-based research projects that advance inclusive scholarly practices and promote greater understanding of diversity through digital research.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The grants of up to $150,000 are also designed to extend the reach of established digital initiatives to new communities of users. The program is made possible through the support of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span>Ruiz shares the grant with her co-principal investigator, assistant film &amp; media studies professor Laila Shereen Sakr at UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I am so excited about this work and this collaboration,&#8221; said Ruiz. &#8220;It is an extension and re-imagining of a long-standing project by Professor Sakr called <i>R-Shief&#8212;</i>an incredible archive that has been collecting millions of social media posts in 30 languages since 2008 related to social movements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Specifically, we are focusing on the now 11-year-old social media archive collected during the 2011 Arab uprisings. Using this database as primary source content, we&#8217;ll be developing a virtual reality (VR) immersive documentary that re-enacts Tahrir Square in 2011&#8212;downtown Cairo&#8217;s main public circle that became a focal point during the uprisings.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;<i>Arab Data Bodies</i> is a mixed reality cinematic world of historical data and public spaces,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It is a VR documentary of the Egyptian Uprising of 2011 that enables participants to experience the historical moment virtually on the ground.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Ruiz&#8217;s scholarly and creative work is concerned with how the intersection of art practice, game/playful design, and digital storytelling can enable new approaches to social activism, aesthetics, and public education. Her work is collaborative, interdisciplinary, and blends theory and practice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We see the next five years as being crucial in the development of mixed realities media and scholarship,&#8221; said Ruiz. &#8220;Professor Sakr and I share a deep interest in exploring collaborative methodological approaches based on the idea and application of &#8216;practice&#8217;&#8212;media, activist, and expressive practices&#8212;that render an informed and careful understanding of mediated shared experience.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

I have noticed in-person activity slowly ratcheting up at UC Santa Cruz, with some staff and faculty beginning to make their way back to our incredible campus. All eyes are on September 18, when fall quarter officially begins. While I am enjoying the quiet that summer brings, I must admit that I am eager to turn the calendar pages and welcome our community back to campus!</p>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fall instruction plans taking shape.</li>
<li>Rising sophomores also prioritized for on-campus housing.</li>
<li>Standing with DACA and UnDACAmented students and families.</li>
<li>Office of the President, UC students group together launch Double the Pell effort.</li>
<li>Mandatory vaccination policy finalized, mask guidance adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fall instruction plans</h2>
<p>This fall, we will have a mix of in-person and remote students, so programs needed to make difficult choices about how best to offer their courses to ensure access in different modes. While more than two-thirds of our classes will be in person, individual students will see variations depending on their major and the courses they are planning to take. We expect to have even more in-person courses in winter and spring as we return to more regular operations, as long as the vaccines continue to be effective against COVID-19 variants. Over the course of the past six quarters, including two Summer Sessions, we have learned many lessons in instruction, innovation and access, and we aim to keep what we&#8217;ve learned front of mind as we move forward.</p>
<h2>On-campus housing for rising sophomores</h2>
<p>There is positive news on the housing front to pair with our plan to return to primarily in-person instruction this fall. After our housing team finalized on-campus housing assignments for all first-year and transfer students, team members were able to accommodate a year of on-campus housing for all rising sophomores who requested housing during the priority period. I am so happy that our sophomore Slugs will get an on-campus housing experience, since most of them spent their first year of college in their hometowns. Living and learning together on our campus will no doubt strengthen the bond of this amazingly resilient cohort.</p>
<p>Move-in is Thursday to Sunday, Sept. 16-19. More details will be provided soon on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEY3zeWhXr7ETdhsM6j_sLXLTjK1Q" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus move-in page</a>. Students assigned to housing will receive specific move-in details at their UCSC email addresses. As usual, volunteers will be needed to help new Slugs and their families find their footing on Day 1. Move-in is always a happy time, and I expect this year will be especially so. Consider joining me as a volunteer and lending these new Slugs a hand! Simply add your name to our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdur2MKlWab9M1mGUMSirWWLLXQmQR1QpV4iFyq3ZQURjoXWw/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWxBWR4a54r3QTISbpLzAnaBZR3Q" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdur2MKlWab9M1mGUMSirWWLLXQmQR1QpV4iFyq3ZQURjoXWw/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">volunteer sign-up form</a>, and you&#8217;ll be notified when it&#8217;s time to select a move-in shift.</p>
<h2>Standing with DACA and UnDACAmented students and families</h2>
<p>In the wake of the court ruling regarding DACA, UCSC reaffirms its commitment to support the well-being of our undocumented students and staff. We will aid students, regardless of any fluctuations in immigration status. We continue to support DACAmented and UnDACAmented members of our community during these uncertain moments, and we will work with you to navigate these changing policies.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor how this recent decision may impact the inclusion of students on campus. We are committed to ensuring that undocumented students are welcome and protected at UCSC. The recently formed UCSC <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/student-spotlight/undocumented-student-initiatives/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQ8VTlqfnZKvuVzlDUf8BLVTQI4w" href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/student-spotlight/undocumented-student-initiatives/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Undocumented Student Initiative</a> brings together students, faculty, staff, alumni and others to, among other things, provide consultative support to UCSC community members working to develop programs and policies, and implement strategies aimed at strengthening the structures that support undocumented students in their academic and personal pursuits. Initiative members will continue to engage around how this decision may impact the experiences of students on campus as we work with colleagues across the University of California system.</p>
<p>The UC Immigrant Legal Services Center, which serves the immigration-related legal needs of undocumented and immigrant students systemwide, issued a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.ucdavis.edu/ucimm/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqta_PBMS5FR_sofLia7tsmHnX6Q" href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/ucimm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement on the DACA court ruling and a frequently-asked-questions document</a> that includes a link to resources. Additional resources are available on our campus through <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCLPc6H6k7GQGMioaOw83a8LY0zw" href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Undocumented Student Services</a>. The university also provides support services for undocumented employees through the Educational Opportunity Program office <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/immigration-legal-services/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5RAVg8QNI5jsr9hL8DgSqNap3yg" href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/immigration-legal-services/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Immigration Legal Services Resources</a>.</p>
<h2>Double the Pell</h2>
<p>Cost should never stop anyone from going to college. Unfortunately, it does. That sad reality is behind an effort launched by the UC Office of the President, the UC Student Association and others calling on Congress to restore the purchasing power of the federal Pell Grant by doubling the maximum award. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWzCaQxoIwg03VpqUnLi6hjt1aCA" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Double the Pell</a> would help our students immensely.</p>
<p>Pell Grants have helped low-income students pay for higher education for more than 55 years, but today they cover only a fraction of the cost of college &#8212; far short of what students need to succeed. Doubling the maximum award would ease the loan burden on the 7 million students who receive Pell Grants annually, and help students meet their basic needs such as food, housing and health care. Expanded federal financial aid would also enable colleges and universities like ours to stretch their own aid funding to assist more families. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWzCaQxoIwg03VpqUnLi6hjt1aCA" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Join us in calling on Congress</a> to Double the Pell so more students can pay for higher education!</p>
<h2>Vaccination policy finalized, mask guidance adjusted</h2>
<p>The UC Office of the President last week released the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/07/ucs-covid-19-vaccine-policy.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgTDfs-_zksTdHaie059wxQMB9kg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/07/ucs-covid-19-vaccine-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">final systemwide policy requiring COVID-19 vaccines</a> of all UC employees and students. Limited exceptions and deferrals are detailed in the policy itself. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjgsg43Yk9tKc7acoB2YvboE5jcw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Answers to frequently asked questions</a> have also been posted online.</p>
<p>If you have yet to receive your vaccine, we encourage you to do so promptly. Many <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHH7a8UyBdNP97i7eBgIjmaNBqqw" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">options are available</a>. The systemwide policy requires employees and students to provide proof of vaccination prior to the start of fall instruction. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxDKt0NbS2MfLGhs9Er2eIo19w7WmgOk/view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtzTMnmaQ6WkdFlp4QyV9okV1MRA" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxDKt0NbS2MfLGhs9Er2eIo19w7WmgOk/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instructions for employees </a>to submit proof of vaccination can be found online.

If you received your vaccine at the Hay Barn through our Student Health Center, we already have that record, and you do not need to provide proof.</p>
<p>On a related note, Santa Cruz County this week joined other Bay Area counties in <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/pdfs/Coronavirus/Joint%2520Statement%2520regarding%2520masking%252019%2520Jul%252021.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuT1QAQ3WR48xhcq8Q3blPDfLEGQ" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/pdfs/Coronavirus/Joint%20Statement%20regarding%20masking%2019%20Jul%2021.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adjusting the guidance for wearing face coverings indoors</a>, regardless of vaccination status. This comes as we face an increasing number of COVID-19 cases in our county and the spread of the very infectious Delta variant. In light of this guidance, we recommend that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those open to the general public. This also applies to our Silicon Valley Campus, as <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.sccgov.org/news-releases/pr-07-16-2021-bay-area-counties-recommend-masking-indoors-for-everyone&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFivcWuqJ6j2O8E2zHfDa54HjpNiw" href="https://covid19.sccgov.org/news-releases/pr-07-16-2021-bay-area-counties-recommend-masking-indoors-for-everyone" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Clara County provided similar guidance</a> last week.</p>
<p>Thank you all for doing your part to support the health and well-being of our university community.</p>
<h2>Fall cohort reflects excellence, diversity</h2>
<p>We <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/fall-admissions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGorf6q4yfIlBSQK6ske4tLtJllsA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/fall-admissions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released our fall admissions numbers</a> this week, and I was thrilled to see the details on our new cohort. We received more than 74,000 undergraduate applications for fall 2021 &#8212; a record &#8212; and we&#8217;re expecting a class of about 6,100 new Banana Slugs. The incoming cohort is both academically distinguished and diverse, reflecting our campus commitment to excellence, equity, and opportunity. Please <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/fall-admissions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGorf6q4yfIlBSQK6ske4tLtJllsA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/fall-admissions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the story on our newscenter</a> for details about our admission numbers. Our campus takes great pride in creating a learning environment that supports diversity of all kinds. Different life experiences invariably lead to unique perspectives, which inform our teaching and research, improve problem-solving, and build bridges, ultimately enriching our campus community. Welcome, new Slugs! We&#8217;re happy to have you!</p>
<h2>Presenting our Long Range Development Plan to Regents</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to present our proposed <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/long-range-development-plan.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXqfs6GTx9tKrwVFN4qdXLysCOkQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/long-range-development-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 Long Range Development Plan</a> to the UC Board of Regents. The LRDP is a blueprint for future physical development on our campus, painting in broad strokes how our main campus and Westside Research Park might develop over the next two decades. The plan identifies where students, staff and faculty could be housed and where spaces for learning and research could be created, while also imagining the infrastructure needed to connect it all. We completed the draft this past winter, capping four years of work by campus leaders and planners plus extensive collaboration with campus and community members. Regents had questions on housing, accessibility and alternative transportation, and liked that the plan includes additional employee housing as well as housing for 100 percent of new students beyond our current planning horizon of 19,500. We aim to return for plan approval later this year. UC Santa Cruz is on an extraordinary trajectory of achievement, and this plan lays out an even brighter future, protecting what is special about our campus while allowing us to continue what we excel at &#8212; providing opportunity, social mobility, and access to a high-quality education to California&#8217;s next generation of leaders.</p>
<h2>Slug Crossing by the numbers</h2>
<p>Our commencement was six weeks ago, but I&#8217;m still hearing great feedback on our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/schedule/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIwub6TEkCV630S57GMZG4FJ6Xcg" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/schedule/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first-ever Slug Crossing</a>. I am so happy we were able to end the academic year on such a high note. Our commencement team did a remarkable job, enabling graduating students to come to campus and physically cross a commencement stage. I have some fun figures from the event I thought I would share:</p>
<ul>
<li>3,124 students participated.</li>
<li>105 current and former faculty and staff volunteered, contributing 531 hours.</li>
<li>More than 41,000 people tuned into <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/schedule/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIwub6TEkCV630S57GMZG4FJ6Xcg" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/schedule/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our livestream</a>, watching for 12,252 hours! (Our most watched countries behind the United States were Mexico, India, Canada, Guatemala, United Kingdom, Japan, and Peru!)</li>
<li>About 125,000 people visited <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgffoB-UdxWbdlZkq24Zi36BMTGw" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our commencement website</a> this year and our university-wide commencement program got more than 14,000 views.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a commencement done right, accomplished under challenging conditions! Thank you to all who were involved!</p>
<h2>An especially inspiring Slug</h2>
<p>I learned many years ago that no two journeys are the same. Even people pursuing a similar goal will travel unique paths to reach it. I was reminded of that when I learned the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/pierini-katharina-commencement.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECvDqX8G0IKOHsZjc8a9Te4ENmGw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/pierini-katharina-commencement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wonderful story of Katharina Pierini</a>, one of our 2021 graduates who took part in our first-ever Slug Crossing. Katharina first enrolled at UCSC in 1994. The story of her 27-year journey from first-year student to commencement stage is a testament to her resilience. I was delighted to see that ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/woman-achieves-goal-27-years-78695312&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627075170876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgKzGgFGSxVh_F1gWe8JUsq6a3Rw" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/woman-achieves-goal-27-years-78695312" rel="noopener" target="_blank">featured Katharina in a recent segment</a>.

Hawthorne in front of flowers in a garden</image-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor&#160;Camilla Hawthorne is&#160;a human geographer and citizen of both the United States and Italy.</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor of Sociology and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Camilla Hawthorne coedited a first-of-its-kind new book called </span><a href="https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030513900"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Mediterranean</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which examines the African diaspora within the region. Hawthorne and her coeditors are members of the Black Mediterranean Collective, an international coalition of scholars and thought-leaders across Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group initially formed in around 2016 to shed light on a refugee crisis in Europe. War and political and economic instability across the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa were driving people to make their way to Europe across the central Mediterranean Sea in one of the largest mass movements in recent history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central Mediterranean passage is one of the world&#8217;s deadliest migration routes. In a single year, thousands of people can lose their lives at sea. Still, the migration process continues to this day, and political opposition has grown within countries like Italy. The members of the Black Mediterranean Collective saw a critical need to situate the refugee crisis and anti-immigrant sentiment within the context of colonial histories and enduring anti-Black racism. That&#8217;s part of what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Mediterranean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets out to do.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were all kind of taken aback by the fact that most of the mainstream media coverage was depicting this as a general humanitarian crisis, and no one was focused on the fact that large numbers of these refugees who were coming into Italy were Black,&#8221; Hawthorne said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really tell the whole story without talking about anti-Blackness and the way that racism and legacies and reverberations of colonialism are caught up with border regimes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a human geographer and citizen of both the United States and Italy, Hawthorne had long been interested in the unique geographies of the Black Mediterranean and how they shape current social and political issues in the region.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we talk about the Black diaspora in Italy, we're talking about people who are descendants of colonial subjects on the African continent who have undergone traumatic experiences of migration, or their parents or family members have,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And they now face restrictive citizenship regimes, as well as the anti-Black racism of the Italian state, and all of those things are connected to each other.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne wrote a chapter for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Mediterranean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that focuses specifically on the racial politics of who and what can be considered &#8220;Italian.&#8221; She explores the example of an urban greenery project in Milan that planted banana and palm trees. Members of the far right in Italy quickly decried this as an &#8220;Africanization&#8221; of an iconic space, and protests loaded with anti-immigrant sentiment ensued. At counter-protests, demonstrators held up economically important plants brought to Italy from other parts of the world as symbols of support for immigrants. Both efforts revealed deeply problematic thinking about pathways to belonging.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The counter-protests actually perpetuated this idea that the only way that Blackness can become assimilable in Italy is by having some kind of economic value to enhance the nation,&#8221; Hawthorne said. &#8220;So whether it's the left or the right, there's still a dehumanization of Blackness that's happening within the normative logics around citizenship.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne hopes the perspectives captured in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Mediterranean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help advocate for major changes in discourse and policies related to the refugee crisis&#8212;and racial justice more broadly&#8212;within the region and beyond. In particular, she hopes Americans will recognize the many parallels between the ways in which issues of immigration, racial justice, and colonialism are interconnected in the Mediterranean and also in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm convinced that the Black Mediterranean is not just another part of the world that we can study to see how different it is, but instead, as Americans, we can learn a lot from the way that political struggles are unfolding in the Mediterranean region,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

consortium on Victorian studies in the world&#8212;will present the 40th year of the Dickens Universe, a week of intense study and festivities, usually among the redwoods and focused on a novel by Charles Dickens.</span></p>
<p><span>The popular annual gathering draws an enthusiastic mix of scholars, teachers, students, and members of the general public, who all share a love of Dickens and his era.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The 2021 Dickens Universe takes place the week of July 26-30, and the featured book this year is one of Dickens&#8217; best known works, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. Due to public health concerns, it will take place online for the second consecutive year.</span></p>
<p><span>Set against a background of social and economic distress during the early 1800s in London, <i>A Christmas Carol </i>is the story of one man&#8217;s conversion from miserly misanthropy to a belief in the goodness of mankind and an acceptance of his place in the larger human community. The book is both an indictment of economic individualism and an exploration of dreams, memory, and the importance of self-reflection.</span></p>
<p><span>John Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project, explained why this particular book was selected as the featured novel this year.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This will be our first attempt at a full-scale virtual Universe,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Last year, we had an online conference in July, but it was an abridged and more narrowly focused event, devoted to current research on Black Victorians and 19th-century Transatlantic studies. This year, while still in pandemic mode, we wanted to have a full-scale Universe or as close to one as we could get via Zoom, and we thought we should focus it around a familiar Dickens text that would attract wide interest. <i>A Christmas Carol</i> was the obvious choice. It's short; everyone knows it; and it's a Dickens favorite with many.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Jordan noted that A <i>Christmas Carol </i>has undergone countless adaptations and rewritings over the years, many of which will be addressed during the week-long program of events.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It is a rich text with a remarkable afterlife,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;There have been over 100 adaptations of the <i>Carol</i> in different media, including some famous film versions. This year's Universe will devote a lot of attention to that afterlife and to questions of adaptation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There will be a panel on Black Adaptations of A <i>Christmas Carol</i>, one on the Royal Shakespeare production (with Director David Edgar and Dickens scholar John Bowen), and one on the opera version (<i>The Passion of Scrooge</i>, with filmmaker Paul Moon and composer John Deak)," he added.</span></p>
<p><span>Other highlights of the week will include film screenings of <i>The Passion of Scrooge, </i>as well as<i> </i>a documentary about the making of the opera, plus a reading by celebrated actress Miriam Margolyes, who played the role of Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter film series.</span></p>
<p><span>Another special feature at this year's Universe will be a rare opportunity for participants to examine and work on transcribing the original manuscript of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, under the direction of scholars and archival consultants from the Morgan Library in New York where the manuscript is housed, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</span></p>
<p><span>Jordan reflected on why the work of Dickens is still important today for 21st-century audiences.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;<i>A Christmas Carol</i> has remained popular all these years for many reasons,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;It addresses social issues that concerned Dickens over a century ago and that remain relevant today: poverty, inequity, class differences, education, disability, and individual responsibility. It is also a powerful story about the relationship between one's present life and one's past.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Scrooge's experience of time travel is a brilliant metaphor for the process of introspection and self-confrontation that all thinking persons must engage in at one time or another,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Among the lessons Scrooge must learn is that a life of possessive individualism is ultimately unsatisfying and that personal happiness must include meaningful connections with other people.&#8221;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>I write to share the bittersweet news that Jeff Shilling, associate vice chancellor for development, has accepted an offer from the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health to serve as the senior vice president for individual giving.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is a great opportunity for Jeff and underscores his tremendous leadership in our campuswide fundraising efforts. His last day at UC Santa Cruz will be Sept. 1.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jeff&#8217;s leadership &#8212; building an excellent development team, working closely with faculty and leaders, and creating lasting relationships with donors &#8212; will have a lasting mark on our campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jeff came to UC Santa Cruz from Stanford University in 2010 to lead our philanthropy team and our first comprehensive fundraising campaign. The campaign raised $335 million, surpassing the goal of $300 million. In addition to engaging donors to help advance our mission, the campaign created a culture of philanthropy and established a new annual fundraising average of $50 million per year. He has also been a trusted partner with campus leaders and faculty, connecting them with donors who believe in our work and want to see the campus reach even greater heights.&#160; He demonstrated extraordinary leadership in FY20 when he served as interim Vice Chancellor for University Relations; our strong position today is due in large part because of his efforts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please join me in congratulating Jeff on this new role and thanking him for his work at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will soon begin a national recruitment for an associate vice chancellor to lead our development team. We&#8217;ll share more soon.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Best,</span></p>

<p>Haussler&#8217;s early research in machine learning helped found the field of computational learning theory, and his later work helped revolutionize the field of genomics with the introduction of advanced statistical and algorithmic methods. His genomics work accelerates the understanding of cancer, human development, evolution, neuroscience and many other areas of the life sciences.</p>
<p>Prepared by <a href="https://www.guide2research.com/">Guide2Research</a>, one of the leading portals for computer science research, the Top Scientists Ranking is a definitive list of leading scientists from the field of computer science and electronics, based on a detailed examination of more than 6,300 profiles on Google Scholar and DBLP (an online computer science bibliography service). Position in the ranking is based on each scientist&#8217;s influential contributions as measured by their &#8220;h-index.&#8221; The h-index quantifies an individual's scientific research output, measuring both productivity and citation impact (how often a scientist&#8217;s publications are cited by other researchers).</p>
<p>Haussler&#8217;s work lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. He develops new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular function and evolution of the human genome, integrating cross-species comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation. He is credited with early insights into the power of artificial neural networks and other machine learning methods, and for pioneering the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in genomics.</p>
<p>As a collaborator on the international Human Genome Project, his team posted the first publicly available computational assembly of the human genome sequence on the Internet on July 7, 2000. Following this, his team developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool that is used extensively in biomedical research and serves as the platform for several large-scale genomics projects.</p>
<p>A Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, Haussler is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has received many awards and honors for his accomplishments, including the 2015 Dan David Prize, the 2011 Weldon Memorial Prize from University of Oxford, and the 2003 ACM Allen Newell Award. Haussler received his PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1986.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f336d0dd807270466cc00b0075d56462"><name>j-herman-blake-career</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oakes Founding Provost J.

Herman Blake will receive the Distinguished Career Award for the Practice of Sociology at the American Sociology Association&#8217;s virtual annual meeting on August 8. The award recognizes Blake&#8217;s lifetime achievements in advancing the field of sociology through the positive impact of his work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both during his time at UC Santa Cruz and in his subsequent roles, Blake&#8217;s career has often centered on access and equity in education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The important thing for me was then and is now reaching out beyond the academy and motivating and inspiring people who have not been considered as worthy of a higher education and seeing them take advantage of the opportunity and grow beyond where they ever anticipated,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake grew up as one of seven children living in poverty outside of New York City, and one of the ways that his family supported his success was by placing a great emphasis on education. He went on to attend New York University for his undergraduate education and UC Berkeley for his master&#8217;s and doctoral degrees. In 1966, he joined the sociology faculty at UC Santa Cruz as the university&#8217;s first Black faculty member.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake then played a leading role in the development of Oakes College, which was founded in 1972 to promote cross-cultural learning and support the academic achievement of students from historically marginalized communities. He served as founding provost of Oakes College until 1984, alongside a group of faculty members representing a diverse array of racial, ethnic, and gender identities and academic disciplines. Blake says those early experiences at Oakes College have remained a bright spot in his career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The faculty at Oakes College was simply extraordinary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Interacting with them&#8212;in a way leading them, and in a way following them&#8212;helped to shape my understanding of who I was and what we were doing academically. When we brought our unique qualities and experiences together and began to speak from those foundations and direct our view toward the vision that we had for ourselves and our students, it led to an academic, social, and intellectual culture that was extremely unique.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following his 18-year tenure at UC Santa Cruz, Blake took on many distinguished roles, including as president of Tougaloo College, vice chancellor at Indiana University, director of African American Studies at Iowa State University, the Eugene M. Lang visiting professor for issues of social change at Swarthmore College, founder of the Sea Islands Institute at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, and the inaugural humanities scholar in residence at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1984, he was part of a national study group that produced the highly influential </span><a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED246833"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involvement in Learning</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report for the U.S. Department of Education, which offered recommendations for improving undergraduate education that have since been utilized by colleges across the country. He was also chairman of the board of directors for </span><a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save The Children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and worked with the organization for 19 years to uplift young people around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake has published extensive academic papers on students of color in higher education and Black militants in urban environments, and he was the founding commissioner and inaugural executive director of the </span><a href="https://gullahgeecheecorridor.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established by the U.S. Congress to recognize the unique heritage of Gullah communities in coastal areas from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Saint Augustine, Florida. Blake has also received two presidential medals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back on it all, he says the three main pillars of his life have always been academics, service, and family. For the past 25 years, he has been married to Emily L. Moore, Ed.D., retired former associate dean for academic and faculty affairs in the MUSC College of Health Professions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, Blake says he is writing a book about Gullah culture and a separate memoir of his experiences at Oakes College, while also pursuing other creative projects in his retirement. Of all his achievements over the course of a highly decorated career, Blake says the role he has played in supporting student success will always be among his biggest points of pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the things I&#8217;m really proud of is that I&#8217;m presently working with former students, some of whom have become peers of mine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I think back over my experience, it has often been about creating analytical perspectives that help people see ways they can transcend whatever circumstances they encounter, and I am always very excited to see that happen.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/07/images/j-herman-blake-oakes-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/07/images/j-herman-blake-oakes-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>j-herman-blake-oakes-featured.jpg</name><display-name>j-herman-blake-oakes-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>10939</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>J.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Katherine Seto is a coauthor on the new paper, alongside researchers from a consortium of institutions and organizations across the Pacific, North America, and Europe, including the University of Wollongong (UOW), Conservation International, the Pacific Community, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, and the Parties to the Nauru Agreement Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study, published in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00745-z?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+natsustain%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+Sustainability%29"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Sustainability</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, combines climate science, ecological modeling, and economic data to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of climate change on Pacific tuna stocks and on the small island states that depend on them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10 island states of the Western and Central Pacific&#8212;Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, and Tuvalu&#8212;are so reliant on their tuna fisheries for economic development and food security that they are considered &#8220;tuna dependent&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The management of most of the islands&#8217; tuna fisheries through a cooperative agreement has been a sustainable development success story over several decades, providing reliable and much-needed revenue for development while preventing the depletion of fish stocks through overfishing. But as the climate changes, key species like skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna that are currently found largely within the waters of Pacific Island states are projected to shift eastward, out of sovereign waters and into the high seas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor Katherine Seto noted that, as more tuna move into the high seas, beyond areas of national jurisdiction, they become vulnerable to overfishing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Preventing overfishing, and ensuring compliance with fisheries management measures, is more difficult outside the exclusive economic zones of the island states because the sole responsibility for compliance rests with the states that flag the fishing vessels, often resulting in self-regulation,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond overfishing concerns, the large-scale movement of fish away from sovereign waters could be devastating to local economies on its own.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around half of the world&#8217;s tuna catch comes from the waters of the Western and Central Pacific, and for those 10 small island states, fishing fees from industrial fishing fleets to gain access to their waters accounts for an average of 37 percent of all government revenue (ranging from 4 percent of government revenue for the relatively large economy of Papua New Guinea to 84 percent for Tokelau).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a continued high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, as more fish move into the high seas, the total biomass of skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna in the waters of the 10 Pacific Island states could decline by an average of 13 percent by 2050, said study lead author Johann Bell, the Senior Director for Pacific Tuna Fisheries at the Conservation International Center for Oceans and a Visiting Professorial Fellow at UOW&#8217;s Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential implications for Pacific Island economies in 2050 include an average decline in purse-seine catch of 20 percent, a loss in regional tuna-fishing access fees of up to $140 million, and reductions in government revenue of up to 17 percent for individual Pacific Island states.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The greenhouse gas emissions of these small island states are negligible, and yet they are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;Many of the island states have very few opportunities to earn income other than from their tuna resources, which are expected to move from their jurisdictions due to ocean warming. This is a climate justice issue that should be raised at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow later this year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future for the Pacific Island states looks more promising under lower greenhouse gas emission scenarios, which would lead to smaller losses. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement would provide a pathway to sustainability for tuna-dependent Pacific Island economies. Regional fisheries management organizations can also play a role in helping Pacific Island states negotiate agreements to maximize the economic benefits of tuna, even as the future distribution of fish may change.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f983ac58807270466cc00b0057c5255a"><name>reduce-electrical-load</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reducing campus electrical load</title><summary>California’s electrical grid may reach its capacity this afternoon (July 30, from 3–9 p.m.).</summary><start-date>1627628400000</start-date><display-name>Reducing campus electrical load</display-name><path>/2021/07/reduce-electrical-load</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/reduce-electrical-load</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1627683793991</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1627683793991</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Thursday evening the University of California received notice from Gov. Gavin Newsom&#8217;s office that California&#8217;s electrical grid may reach its capacity this afternoon (July 30, from 3&#8211;9 p.m.). Accordingly, UC has been asked to take all feasible actions to reduce campus electrical loads and maximize our own power generation during these critical hours.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz will contribute by configuring our system to maximize power generation from the cogeneration plant. That action, combined with power production from our new East Remote Parking Lot solar array, should ensure we can completely power our campus without further stressing the electrical grid.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will not take any actions that might add risk to campus teaching or research operations. While we do not anticipate the loss of power to campus, a power outage can occur unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We also ask building occupants and residents to contribute to our efforts where possible by turning off lights, appliances, and equipment not in use during these hours.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The support UC is providing is much appreciated by the Governor&#8217;s Office and the California agencies involved with energy production. We hope that our efforts, combined with those by others, will be sufficient to avoid serious problems for California&#8217;s grid.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public

underscoring the importance of community</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California retirees are an active, engaged group of individuals who are giving back to their communities through volunteerism and launching new endeavors. A recent survey of nearly 5,000 UC retirees provides a snapshot of how retirees are using their time and sharing their talents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey report, &#8220;</span><a href="https://retirees.ucsc.edu/announcements/cucra-2020-survey-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Retirees: Generous Talents, Enduring Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; focuses on the lives of 4,980 retired UC staff and non-senate academics who participated in an anonymous, online questionnaire last fall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common ways respondents are spending their retirement is volunteering regularly for community and civic organizations, faith-based groups and political causes. While many commented that their volunteer activities have been curtailed by the pandemic, most plan to resume once it&#8217;s safe to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And 25% of systemwide respondents said they have volunteered for UC, indicative of the enduring connection many feel to their home campuses, medical centers and labs and their strong support for the university&#8217;s mission. Retirees for UC have served as volunteer mentors, teachers, advisers, fundraisers and participants in many campus programs and activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of retirees have also donated more than $60 million to UC campuses over the past four fiscal years, according to data provided by retiree associations, retirement centers, and development offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe the project underscores that if individuals have a fondness for their campus and communities, they will freely share their time, talents and treasure,&#8221; said John Meyer, chair of the Council of University of California Retiree Associations. Meyer retired from UC Davis in 2014 as its Administrative Vice Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report will be shared with university leaders, who support maintaining the strong relationship between retirees and UC, Meyer said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our responsibilities is to share with university and campus leaders any barriers to such a positive relationship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have found university leaders very interested in ensuring this relationship thrives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of respondents reported having an active lifestyle: 60% were engaged in staying physically fit; 58% had traveled; 50% gardened; 47% spent time outdoors and in nature; and 32% enjoyed the performing arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also showed that more than half of the respondents, 53%, have served as caregivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high number of caregivers could be due in part to the upheaval caused by the pandemic, survey organizers said. Some respondents noted that they were helping out their children who had become unemployed or assisting with the care of grandchildren learning at home while their parents worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz retirement community exemplifies the richness of retired life through giving back, caring for others, creativity and expression, activism, cultural appreciation, and having fun with family and friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This survey shows the vitality of retired UC staff. Our retirees are active and involved in a variety of pursuits,&#8221; said Bill Parro, President of the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association. &#8220;I hope that this report helps motivate us to stay in touch and share in our mutual endeavors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://retirees.ucsc.edu/announcements/cucra-2020-ucsc-demographics.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights from UCSC retirees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">66% live within ten miles of a UC location</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">77% volunteered in the community</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">34% volunteered at UCSC</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">48% provided professional services</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22% have authored a written work</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These surveys confirm that many UC retirees maintain a continuing relationship with the University and are productive, contributing citizens in their communities,&#8221; said Lee Duffus, former Chair of CUCRA, who retired from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC Santa Cruz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was sponsored by CUCRA to capture the activities of retirees from 2017 -&#160; 2020. CUCRA is a systemwide consortium of 13 organizations representing retirees from nine campuses, three national laboratories and the UC Office of the President. Emeriti faculty participate in a separate survey, sponsored by the Council of University of California Emeriti Associations (CUCEA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be clear that this is not a true random survey,&#8221; explained Meyer. &#8220;The responses measured are from those who chose to respond &#8212; and those individuals likely maintain an interest in serving their campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Meyer said, &#8220;We believe it&#8217;s valuable for our organization to assess and report on the level of engagement retirees maintain with their campuses and their communities. This can then be shared with university and campus leaders to underscore the ongoing value of retirees.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://retirees.ucsc.edu/announcements/cucra-2020-survey-report.pdf</url><title>UC Retirees report “Generous Talents, Enduring Community”</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://retirees.ucsc.edu/announcements/cucra-2020-ucsc-demographics.pdf</url><title>UCSC Retiree infographic</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77dbfd00807270172c1b96bdac1e12db"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>July</title><start-date>1625122800000</start-date><display-name>July</display-name><path>/2021/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/07/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1608328674545</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609787708373</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
