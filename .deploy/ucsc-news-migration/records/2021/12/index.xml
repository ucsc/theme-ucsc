<p>Additional details on the Landed program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landed's shared-equity down payment program invests alongside UCSC employees to help them reach a 20% down payment. Landed&#8217;s funds come in the form of an equity investment, meaning homebuyers share in a portion of the gain (or loss, if any) of the home&#8217;s value once the partnership is ended&#8212;typically by sale or refinance.</li>
<li>The down payment program is one piece of holistic homebuying support that Landed offers, including in-depth homebuyer education, access to a vetted real estate agent network, and comprehensive reviews of property reports to help homebuyers make informed homebuying decisions. Landed also offers an experienced homebuying team to help navigate the homebuying process, from financing to search to close.</li>
<li>Landed&#8217;s down payment program is open to all UCSC employees working 20 hours or more per week and is available immediately. Participants do not need to be first time homebuyers and there are no income or asset limits needed to qualify.</li>

But gender stereotypes related to children&#8217;s toys may limit what ends up on holiday gift lists in ways that aren&#8217;t necessarily in children&#8217;s best interests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To shed light on this topic, the UC Santa Cruz news team connected with Distinguished Professor of Psychology Campbell Leaper, a developmental and social psychologist who has decades of experience studying gender issues. Leaper&#8217;s </span><a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2018-05827-013"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has identified the causes and consequences of popular beliefs around which toys are &#8220;for boys&#8221; or &#8220;for girls.&#8221; In the interview below, we asked Leaper to share his insights and some gift-giving tips to help all children get the broadest possible range of benefits out of their toys this holiday season.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Professor Leaper, could you start us off with some historical context? What do people need to know about how gender stereotypes in children&#8217;s toys became an issue?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there&#8217;s certainly a very long history of parents encouraging different activities for girls and boys, but what started to happen in the mid-20th century was that companies wanted to be able to effectively market toys to either girls or boys. So they developed a color-coding system. This is where the concept of &#8220;pink is for girls, blue is for boys&#8221; came from.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coordinated effort to color-code toys into gender categories had an effect of exaggerating the differences in which activities were encouraged for boys versus girls. Around that same time, toy stores built upon this by increasingly creating separate sections for girls and boys. Whereas color-coding had been a bit more subtle in its messaging, these physical sections in stores were very explicitly labeling what was for girls or boys. And this was telling children and parents what kinds of toys they should be looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are some types of toys that parents would likely have been inclined to stereotype based on their child's gender anyways; like a doll, for example. But there&#8217;s also a whole range of other toys, which parents might otherwise have been more open to encouraging for all children, that instead became stereotyped for one particular gender as a result of some of these marketing practices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>And how do these gender stereotypes affect children&#8217;s development?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that between 2 and 3 years of age, children start to learn to associate pink with girls, and to a lesser extent, blue for boys. At about this same time, children are starting to develop a concept of their own gender. That usually means girls become attracted to things that are pink, and boys want to avoid things that are pink. So, one of the problems with toy companies putting those colors on things is that it steers children away from toys that they might otherwise find interesting, because it&#8217;s a signal to make children think, "Oh that's not for me."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During those same preschool years, children's thinking is very concrete. They don't yet have the cognitive capacity to understand nuance. And those years are the time when they&#8217;re most actively playing with toys. So it&#8217;s a double whammy for reinforcing gender stereotypes, because they're already rigid thinkers, and then they're also getting a lot of environmental cues telling them what it means to be a girl or a boy. It&#8217;s not until around age 6 or 7 that they may start to realize that not all girls or boys have the same interests and that gender identity is much more complicated than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big issue that comes up with this is how gender stereotypes around toys affect gender-nonconforming children, who don't identify with or feel like they fit in with their assigned gender. Gender-related labels or color cues on toys can be harmful for these children. It makes them feel bad; like they aren't accepted for who they are.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>What might children gain from a wider range of options for toys and play?&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One really important thing to recognize is that toys are opportunities for children to practice particular kinds of behaviors and skills. Adults may think that kids are only having fun when they&#8217;re playing, but there are many studies that show how children develop their cognitive and social skills through play. Use of a variety of toys can facilitate development of a variety of skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a child is playing with a baby doll, they&#8217;re practicing nurturing and caregiving skills. If they&#8217;re playing with a food set or having a tea party, they&#8217;re often practicing conversation and developing their social skills. If they&#8217;re playing with construction toys, they&#8217;re developing spatial skills, which seem to indirectly facilitate development of math competencies later in life. With sports or adventure play, children are developing confidence in the use of their bodies, which can lead to more positive body esteem. In my mind, these are all useful skills for children of any gender to practice and develop.</span></p>
<p><strong>What tips would you offer for how adults can encourage kids to try new things?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to help your child become more flexible in the kinds of toys with which they play, one strategy is to provide them with a variety of toys. This will likely be easiest during the toddler years&#8212;around 1 to 3 years old&#8212;which is before children are likely to hold gender-stereotyped beliefs about which toys are considered desirable for girls versus boys. There&#8217;s a whole range of toys, from those that are very gender stereotypical to those that would be very counter-stereotypical. If you have a preschool-age or older child who already holds gender-stereotyped views, I&#8217;d recommend starting somewhere in the middle to help your child expand their comfort zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you have a preschool-age boy, maybe don't give them a doll as the very first counter-stereotypical thing that you introduce, because they'll likely associate that with being for girls. Instead, you could give them something like a food play set, which is still socially interactive in ways that may be new for them, but perhaps it&#8217;s less threatening to their gender-stereotyped beliefs. It&#8217;s also helpful to expose children to counter-stereotypical images, through things like non-traditional representations in children&#8217;s picture books and other media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And children pay a lot of attention to who their gender role models are and what those people do. So it&#8217;s important for children to learn from adults that it's okay to play with new types of toys. A mother and daughter sitting down together to play with a construction set is a good way to dispel gender stereotypes, and it&#8217;s even better if there&#8217;s a female friend from the daughter&#8217;s peer group who might enjoy playing together too.</span></p>
<p><strong>What makes the holidays a good time to test out these ideas?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays are a good opportunity because, traditionally, it's a time when children are asking for toys, and adults are giving toys. In some cases, children may be getting multiple toys at once, which actually makes it a bit easier. If you were to give a child only a counter-stereotypical toy, they might be pretty disappointed. But if it's one of a few things that they receive, it just gives them new options in what to play with. As mentioned, some gentle encouragement may be needed to get a child to play with the counter-stereotypical toys.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For younger children, coming up with a holiday wish list is also an opportunity to have a conversation with them about their interests. In that process, you may be able to broaden their ideas about what types of toys could support those interests.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any other advice to share about how adults can support healthy play?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best advice is always to be flexible with children. You want to be accepting of your child while also encouraging them to seek out multiple opportunities throughout their lives. During early childhood, that includes different styles of play. It&#8217;s very similar to how you might encourage an older child to excel in a variety of different school subjects or try out a few different extracurricular activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more that young people can discover new things, the more opportunity they have to find what interests them and develop their talents.

She is the 34th recipient of this lifetime achievement award, which in the past has been given to Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Walter Mosley.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appearing on camera wearing the large brass medal given to winners each year, Yamashita said she was, &#8220;stunned to be here,&#8221; and thanked NBF Executive Director Ruth Dickey and Board Chair David Steinberger for this &#8220;gracious and profound honor.&#8221; She also singled out her longtime publisher Coffee House Press and her &#8220;colleagues, students, and staff at UC Santa Cruz who have provided me with a home to research and write.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thank all of you who have gifted me with this amazing journey,&#8221; she said, during the Nov. 17 online ceremony. &#8220;I have been truly blessed.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yamashita used her acceptance speech, in part, to emphasize the significance of this medal being awarded to an Asian-American writer &#8220;especially this year, post-pandemic, having weathered the Twitter absurdity, corruption, and mendacity; the brutality of racial profiling; and the provocation of anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim, [and] anti-Asian hatred.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In such times,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;may our writing forge tolerance and care.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through much of her acceptance speech, Yamashita reflected and offered thanks to the people who helped support her journey as a writer. She pointed to two beloved aunts who recognized her talent with words and brought her to meet Yoshiko Uchida, a family friend and Japanese-American who had written several books on her experiences growing up amid the anti-Asian hatred of World War II. This opened Yamashita up to the work of many other Asian-American writers of Uchida&#8217;s generation, including John Okada, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, and Wakako Yamauchi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yamashita reserved her strongest statements for the end of her speech, using the Japanese folk tale of Urashima Taro as a metaphor for the experience of being a writer and of being alive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that story, Taro rescues a turtle from a group of children and is rewarded by being carried by the creature to an underwater kingdom. While he lives in luxury in this palace, he misses home and decides to return. Before he leaves, the princess of this kingdom gifts him with a jewel box, instructing Taro to never open it lest he be forced to face the consequences within. Upon returning, he realizes 100 years have passed. Unable to contain his curiosity, he opens the gifted box and immediately turns into the old man he should be.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yamashita unpacked the layers of meaning within this story during her acceptance speech. The turtle, she said, could be the vehicle for our life&#8217;s journey or &#8220;with its shell as home has a different lesson. How we must travel within our bodies, even if marked by ethnicity, gender, color. Immigrants, refugees, exiles, by the fortunes of life, have set forth on the backs of immortal turtles to distant places&#8230; to discover that return is impossible.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too, the jewel box, in Yamashita&#8217;s mind, becomes a potent symbol for the creative process, daring her fellow writers to open it up and reap the consequences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We discover,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that writing what we think, turning ideas on the page, can reconstruct ways of thinking. Ideas are dangerous and transformative. Writing them is creative work for which we are responsible, accountable. Writing requires our constant care and integrity.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This award from the National Book Foundation is just the latest accolade for Yamashita. The author of 10 books, she has received numerous honors during her career. Her 2011 novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Hotel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a finalist for the National Book Award, and in 2009, she received a John Dos Passos Prize for Literature.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/karen-tei-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/karen-tei-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen-tei-featured.jpg</name><display-name>karen-tei-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>41617</file-size><width>590</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Karen Tei Yamashita</thumb-alt><title>Karen Tei Yamashita: Literary Luminary</title><description>UC Santa Cruz emerita professor of literature Karen Tei Yamashita received the 2021 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from The National Book Foundation, presenter of the National Book Awards.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="820aca02807270462612537cb88a2e2c"><name>second-harvest-drive-2021</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Stepping up to fight food insecurity</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has expanded its annual Second Harvest Holiday Food and Fund Drive to help boost donations—needed now more than ever in the wake of the pandemic, wildfires, and economic turmoil.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman was in her late 60s and had worked all her life. But when her husband and her landlord each died within months of each other, the retiree found herself unable to find affordable housing and was living in her car. Thanks to Second Harvest Food Bank, food was the least of her worries. The woman was able to get a variety of healthy staples and vegetables each week as she tried to get back on her feet.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, her story is not unique in Santa Cruz County, according to Suzanne Willis, chief development officer at Second Harvest Food Bank. In a county known for its bucolic beaches and redwood forests, food insecurity is a very real problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, UC Santa Cruz is stepping up to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only has the campus expanded its annual </span><a href="https://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Harvest Holiday Food and Fund Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;it now runs from Nov. 9 to Jan. 15&#8212;but a new format also allows faculty and staff to team up in order to help surpass last year&#8217;s donations of nearly $40,000 and make the drive more sustainable in years to come, according to its organizers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people we&#8217;re seeing are bank tellers, grocery store checkers, wait staff, field workers, our neighbors,&#8221; said Second Harvest&#8217;s Willis, who has witnessed an increase in need. Pre-pandemic, the food bank provided food to 55,000 people per month, she said, with aid rising to 100,000 people each month during the height of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. Now, the food bank is serving 75,000 people each month.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you are in a room with three people, look around,&#8221; said Willis, who noted one third of the county&#8217;s population is classified as being at risk of food insecurity. &#8220;One of them is probably barely making ends meet.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need in this community is very real,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;The pandemic, the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-wildfire-evacuation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZU wildfires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the economic turmoil of the past two years have been incredibly hard on so many people. I&#8217;m deeply proud of the work Second Harvest does, amazed at the incredible number of people the food bank is able to help, and thankful for all who donate to the annual drive. We are making a positive impact.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Stretching dollars</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of Second Harvest Food Bank, the second oldest food bank in the country, is its ability to stretch every dollar it receives, according to Nathan McCall, manager of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s HR Business Information Services and chair of the Staff Advisory Board, which heads the campus&#8217;s Second Harvest drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Second Harvest has been in business for so long with a continuity of leadership, he said, it has built relationships that allow it to buy fresh produce for pennies on the dollar. For example, it can purchase a truckload of produce for $75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s how they can feed a family of four for $1,&#8221; McCall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A donation of $1,100 means that same family can eat for a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s why UC Santa Cruz has moved away from the traditional blue barrels that people used to fill with purchased food and toward an emphasis on monetary donations, McCall said. Donated money goes much further than contributed cans of soup and corn.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus also has extended the fund drive into January so that those who wish to donate in 2021 and 2022 can take a tax deduction both this year and next, McCall said. In addition, this year, groups on campus can work as sub-teams within the larger UC Santa Cruz campus&#8212;as Baskin Engineering and the Social Sciences Division are doing, for example. This allows groups &#8220;to harness energy around the local effort,&#8221; McCall said, and make fundraising more sustainable over the coming years for the whole of UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, teams like Baskin Engineering are pioneering new partnerships with businesses in the community like Annieglass, he said. On Dec. 11, for instance, the store will donate 20 percent of its sales to Second Harvest on behalf of UC Santa Cruz. (See details below.)</span></p>
<h3>A firsthand view</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Wells, who managed information systems for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s University Relations Department until her retirement in 2007, has seen firsthand the help Second Harvest can provide. Named Hunger Fighter of the Year by Second Harvest Food Bank in 2020, Wells helps run a twice-weekly food pantry at Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Santa Cruz. Its clients, she said, include everyone from the disabled to the houseless to single mothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week about 100 people arrive at the church to receive food, the majority provided by Second Harvest, Wells said. The food not only includes basics like eggs and cereal but also plenty of fresh vegetables&#8212;some 60 percent of its offerings, according to the Second Harvest website. That makes Second Harvest one of &#8220;the healthiest food banks in the nation,&#8221; its website said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to collect and distribute food to places like food pantries and nonprofits is helped tremendously by donations from UC Santa Cruz, according to Willis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also important for the campus&#8217;s students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, for example, more than 31,000 pounds of food from Second Harvest were distributed to people living in Family Student Housing, while Slug Support handed out just over 61,000 pounds of food and the Student Union Assembly gave out about 27,000 pounds, according to McCall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said McCall of the campus&#8217;s Second Harvest drive: &#8220;I love to help people, and this is a very tangible way to do it. If you can donate a few bucks, it&#8217;s so easy to make a big, positive impact on people&#8217;s lives, thanks to Second Harvest&#8217;s network.&#8221;</span></p>

The annual competition brings together student teams from around the world to present synthetic biology projects that aim to address pressing global issues.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s iGEM team, one of 370 participating in this year&#8217;s event, developed a system called <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:UCSC">Progenie</a> that&#8217;s designed to target and eliminate a toxic gene found in Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>, a family of bacteria responsible for some of the most severe forms of food poisoning. Their method provides an effective alternative to the antibiotics commonly used in agriculture, which not only destroy helpful as well as harmful microbes, but are also responsible in part for the sharp rise in drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>Co-captains Stephen Hwang, now a first-year biomolecular engineering and bioinformatics graduate student, and Torrey Brownell, a fourth-year biology student, explained that their team was inspired by a shared interest in environmental health and biology and a desire to address issues affecting the local agriculture industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developing our project idea took months of brainstorming, research, and outreach,&#8221; said Brownell. &#8220;We wanted our project to have a strong positive impact on our community and give us room to explore each of our scientific interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eager to ensure that their efforts would have a real-world impact, team UCSC solicited input from members of the local community who would benefit most from their new technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project was solidified after our team talked with local stakeholders&#8212;cattle ranchers, farmers, and packaging plant workers&#8212;and heard about the economic and food waste impact that occurs with foodborne bacterial outbreaks,&#8221; said Hwang.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges of having to collaborate remotely for the first three months of their project due to the COVID-19 pandemic, team UCSC&#8217;s momentum never wavered. They worked closely with their faculty advisor David Bernick, associate teaching professor of biomolecular engineering, who provided guidance and helped the team set goals and timelines. In March, they were able to begin in-person lab work on campus, allowing them to develop and test their system.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most fulfilling aspects of iGEM was helping a pandemic-starved group of students become the engineers and scientists that they have been dreaming about for years. This year, that &#8216;becoming&#8217; was big, bold, and loud,&#8221; said Bernick.</p>
<p>At the jamboree, teams are judged on their virtual project posters, wiki pages, and video presentations. Teams are awarded gold medals if they demonstrate excellence across multiple categories and uphold the key iGEM principles of respect, community, and honesty.</p>
<p>When asked what factors contributed to their team&#8217;s success, Hwang and Brownell praised their team&#8217;s dynamic and each team member&#8217;s drive, support, and ability to learn from one another.</p>
<p>Hwang added that one of his most memorable experiences as an iGEM 2021 co-captain was watching less experienced team members grow into confident researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;When planning experiments, we would often have the choice between allowing someone who was already skilled in the method get the experiment done quickly, or someone who didn&#8217;t have that background learn those new skills,&#8221; said Hwang. &#8220;By giving each team member the opportunity to learn a variety of skills, we developed a stronger, more versatile team.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to collaborating with one another and UCSC faculty members, team UCSC held frequent virtual meetings with faculty experts from Columbia University, Stanford University, and UC San Francisco, and even worked closely with a student research team from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata (IISER-Kolkata).</p>
<p>&#8220;With the support from IISER-Kolkata, the global impact and international ideas of iGEM were definitely true to our team,&#8221; said Brownell.</p>
<p>The 2021 UCSC team included co-captains Hwang and Brownell and members Rhea Kamath, Franklin Zheng, David Kelaita, Denise Calderon, Julia Howard, Tobin Berger-Cahn, Rose Delvillar, Nabil Mohammed, Yi-Chi Chu, Tanya Ivanov, Tarabryn Grismer, Wen Liu, Emily Hallamasek, and Fonz Gamino.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>These burns are part of the prescribed fire program for vegetation management, hazardous fuel load reduction, wildlife habitat improvement, and other ecological benefits. This treatment will enhance the health of the grassland by removing thatch, restoring essential nutrients to the soil, and reducing the chance of a catastrophic wildfire.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The burns are scheduled from Dec. 6&#8211;20. Proactive monitoring and patrol will continue through the week and weekend.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At Wilder Ranch State Park, California State Parks will burn roughly 280 acres of redwood understory.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These prescribed burns are permitted, planned and coordinated with the Monterey Bay Air Quality Management District and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in order to minimize the smoke impacts on surrounding communities. All burning depends on weather and air quality conditions that are favorable for smoke dispersal. If the conditions are not conducive for burning, the burns will be rescheduled.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>People around the Monterey Bay area as well as those driving on Highway 1 may see smoke on the day of the burns. In the unlikely event you smell smoke, Santa Cruz County officials urge you to take precautions and use common sense to reduce any harmful health effects by limiting outdoor activities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Prescribed burns produce significantly less smoke than wildfire. If you see or smell smoke in your surroundings, officials recommend avoiding strenuous outdoor activity and remaining indoors as much as possible. These precautions are especially important for children, the elderly and people with respiratory and heart conditions. Please use extreme caution while driving near prescribed fire operations due to fire personnel and equipment in the area.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Personnel participating in the project will adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state guidelines to minimize exposure to and the spread of COVID-19. California State Parks is adhering to the safety protocols set by public health officials and have made accommodations to limit exposure among first responders and field crews to protect staff from COVID-19 during prescribed burns.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150a604807270462612537c18739a68"><name>climate-change-plants-human-land-use</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New study shows plants struggle to keep pace with climate change in human-dominated landscapes</title><summary>A new global-scale analysis found a mismatch between plant phenology and rising temperatures that was more pronounced in the most human-dominated landscapes, especially crop lands. </summary><start-date>1638777600000</start-date><path>/2021/12/climate-change-plants-human-land-use</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/climate-change-plants-human-land-use</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1638820521456</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1638820709997</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/farm-land-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/farm-land-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-land-400.jpg</name><display-name>farm-land-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>55191</file-size><width>400</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt>Aerial view of farm land</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/farm-land-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/farm-land-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-land-80.jpg</name><display-name>farm-land-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21614</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aerial view of farm land</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found that changes in plant phenology are lagging behind rising temperatures across a majority of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the most human-dominated landscapes, like crop lands. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at UC Santa Cruz are contributing new insights into the challenges plants face in adapting to climate change. Prior research has long anticipated that plants might be able to respond to increasing temperatures by changing their phenology&#8212;or the timing of seasonal life processes&#8212;at a rate that matches the rate of climate change. But a new global-scale analysis, published in the journal </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021AV000431"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AGU Advances</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shows that phenological changes are lagging temperature change, and this trend seems to be more pronounced in human-dominated landscapes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We would commonly expect phenology to adapt very quickly to climate change, but with these findings, we see that there&#8217;s probably a limit to how much adaptation we can see, and this limit is affected by human activities,&#8221; said Yiluan Song, a UCSC Ph.D. student in environmental studies and lead author of the paper. &#8220;These findings open up a lot of questions to explore in terms of our expected response of plants to climate change.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To arrive at their findings, the research team&#8212;under the guidance of UCSC Associate Professor of Environmental Studies Kai Zhu&#8212;focused on the Northern Hemisphere at mid- to high- latitudes and analyzed satellite remote-sensing data that detects the warm-season growth of plants on the ground. Growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere are generally expected to start earlier and last longer as average annual temperatures increase. But in comparing the rate of change for both factors geographically, the paper identified a spatial mismatch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the analysis, between 1981 and 2014, the length of the growing season has changed slower than the average annual near-surface temperature across a majority of the Northern Hemisphere. And in some areas, these changes were even moving in the opposite direction, with growing seasons compressing when they were expected to lengthen. There was a high degree of variability across the study region, but these trends were especially prominent in Europe and parts of North America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers are working to understand why this mismatch between growing season phenology and temperature change might be occurring. One possibility is that the rate of temperature change may simply be too great for plant phenology to adequately keep up. Prior research also shows that plants may be limited by their need to respond to other environmental variables too&#8212;like the length of the day and precipitation&#8212;and that the species types and compositions of plant communities across parts of the Northern Hemisphere may shape phenological response. But the new study also points to another key variable: human activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Song and the research team layered their findings of phenological mismatch with data on human population density and land-use types across the study area. This analysis revealed that phenological mismatch corresponded with human population density across latitudes. And the effect was more pronounced in the most human-dominated landscapes, especially croplands.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the whole study area, the larger trend of lag or divergence in phenological changes across human-impacted landscapes offset a trend where phenological shifts were actually ahead of temperature changes in wildland areas. The team supported their findings with additional data from on-the-ground observations by citizen scientists. This analysis showed that the mismatch between temperature-related environmental conditions and the timing of initial growth of spring leaves increased with human population density.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper&#8217;s authors hope their findings might help to inform new approaches in the study of plant phenology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While plant phenology has been well-researched, conventional approaches focus on natural systems&#8212;looking at forests or grasslands and intentionally excluding the areas with human dominance,&#8221; explained Kai Zhu, senior author of the paper. &#8220;But we are in the Anthropocene. When you look at the land across the earth, a large chunk of it has been modified by humans, and I think this study shows that it would be a mistake to not account for that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhu said studying phenology across all land-use types could help to build a more comprehensive understanding of the role plants play in the climate system, which also affects the projections produced by climate change models and resulting management plans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We particularly want to know more about the implications of these new findings on the carbon cycle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Plants are currently doing us a great service in taking up a lot of the carbon emissions we put into the atmosphere, but the length of the growing season is an important factor that determines how much carbon they can sequester.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In agricultural settings, warming can accelerate crop development, leading to an early harvest, but adaptive management practices could better match plant phenology with climate conditions to take advantage of longer growing seasons. Additional research will be needed to understand how human activities&#8212;like irrigation, selective planting, or land disturbance&#8212;might affect climate-phenology coupling and what the long-term impacts of this effect could be.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the paper&#8217;s authors argue that maintaining a stable relationship between climate and plant phenology is crucial for maintaining both biological diversity and ecosystem productivity into the future. And the more scientists can learn about the factors affecting phenological responses, the better prepared society will be to manage ecosystems productively.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We anticipate that the degree of mismatch may ultimately depend on how humans intervene,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;If we are smart enough, I think we could probably be adaptive to climate change through better management of plants. We are still learning in that process.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9185e090807270462612537cc001ed1e"><name>winter-break-instructions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Action required - Instructions for Winter Break</title><summary>As we near the end of the fall quarter, we are reaching out today regarding the university’s COVID testing protocol in advance of Winter Break (Dec. 11 through Jan. 2). </summary><start-date>1638777600000</start-date><display-name>Action required - Instructions for Winter Break</display-name><path>/2021/12/winter-break-instructions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/winter-break-instructions</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1638824009835</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1638824009835</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we near the end of the fall quarter, we are reaching out today regarding the university&#8217;s <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html%23winter_protocol&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638910225399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wWU7AJLgruHqR3eUtcmd_" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html#winter_protocol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID testing protocol</a> in advance of Winter Break (Dec. 11 through Jan. 2).

(Bob) Garrison, professor emeritus of ocean sciences, passed away on Friday, November 26, 2021, at his home in Santa Cruz, in the presence of his wife Jan, son James, and daughter-in-law Alma.</p>
<p>Bob Garrison came to Santa Cruz in 1968 and was one of the original group of six faculty members that established and developed the Earth Sciences Board at UC Santa Cruz and brought it to international prominence. He was an extraordinarily kind and giving person in his encouragement and influence on the development of a large number of UCSC graduate and undergraduate students, researchers, faculty members, and colleagues who have, in turn, gone on to make their own contributions and impacts. Bob and Jan graciously opened their home and hearts and made a long stream of students and visitors feel welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>Garrison was born in Texas in 1932 during the Great Depression when many people, including his parents, were struggling because of the harsh economic conditions and lack of jobs. Searching for a brighter future, his family had migrated from Indiana to Texas because they had heard of jobs in the oil fields. His father did get a job working for the Texas Oil Company (Texaco) in Saudi Arabia, and after his return the entire family moved to San Francisco, when Bob was still a teenager. He enrolled at Stanford University and graduated in 1955 with a B.S., supporting himself by serving food in a campus dormitory.</p>
<p>It was in a field geology course to the Santa Lucias that Garrison first was exposed to the sedimentary rocks of the Monterey Formation, which was to become the cornerstone of much of his subsequent research career. He stayed on and received a M.S. degree at Stanford in 1958, which was followed by a Fulbright Fellowship to study at the University of Innsbruck in Austria for a year, where he developed an interest in limestones. The year in Europe marked another important point in his life when he met his lifelong partner, Jan.</p>
<p>After the Fulbright, Garrison returned to the states and worked for two years for Sunray DX Oil Company in Wyoming, where he developed an appreciation of the commercial applications of geology.</p>
<p>The 1960s were some of the most exciting years in Garrison&#8217;s career and life. He and Jan were married in 1963. From 1961-65 he studied for his Ph.D. at Princeton University under the mentorship of Alfred Fischer, returning for two years of fieldwork in the Austrian Alps and making seminal contributions to our understanding of the Jurassic pelagic limestones and radiolarites there. He spent a year at UC Santa Barbara as an assistant professor in 1965-66, moved north to join the faculty at the University of British Columbia from 1966 to 1968, and returned to California as an associate professor in the new Earth sciences program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In 1966, Garrison participated in geologic field training of Apollo astronauts in Oregon, including three who would later walk on the lunar surface. In 1969, he sailed to the northwestern Pacific Ocean as sedimentologist on Leg 6 of the fledgling Deep Sea Drilling Project. He also initiated his work on the siliceous rocks of California&#8217;s Monterey Formation, of which he became a foremost expert.</p>
<p>Bob Garrison was an outstanding sedimentologist who made critical contributions to the science through his research, publications, influence on colleagues, and shaping of his many students. He fundamentally changed our understanding of the origin, distribution, and diagenesis of fine-grained marine sediments, most notably the siliceous, calcareous, and phosphatic rocks. He also generated enormous international goodwill, cooperation, integration, and scientific progress with his tireless efforts to involve scientists from all institutions, regions, and countries in the understanding of the sedimentary deposits of the deep sea and continental shelves.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Garrison consistently addressed fundamental sedimentologic problems in fields that had previously been inadequately addressed because of the lack of appropriate methodology or due to being outside of popular trends in research. His scientific curiosity was guided by his concern for the human condition, and much of his research focused on the origin of the sedimentologic resources of energy and fertilizer necessary for our communal well-being.</p>
<p>Garrison was also a superb and thoughtful teacher at all levels. He helped students develop a broad understanding of the world's geologic and cultural diversity by bringing his extensive international experience (and never-ending stream of visiting colleagues) into many classes, seminars, and field trips. He was committed to providing opportunities in academia to people who were outside of the traditional pathways, long before it was an explicit goal of the university.</p>
<p>Garrison retired from UCSC in 1994, but continued to travel, carry out research, write, advise students, and organize conferences. His influence on an entire generation of students, collaborations with many national and international colleagues, generosity with his time, and modesty regarding his own accomplishments are hallmarks of Bob Garrison&#8217;s life and career.</p>

<h2>Before Leaving</h2>
<p>As a reminder, anyone planning to travel away from Santa Cruz and its surrounding communities for the Winter Break should familiarize themselves with the CDC&#8217;s latest recommendations for <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Hb4KazHPW_Ve2Vnv0kaa5" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">domestic</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FXfDo97MZavQiFEfJITMo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">international</a> travel to minimize COVID infection due to Omicron and other variants. We also recommend that you review the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/noticescovid19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yXntQiFEDT1PqypeWaAlS" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/noticescovid19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comprehensive list</a> on the CDC website of countries with travel restrictions, such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Germany, and Denmark.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you receive a COVID-19 booster shot as soon as you qualify (at least two months after receiving the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine or six months after your second Moderna or Pfizer dose). Currently, booster shots are not available on campus, but please see the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WJrexCuTAyvEpyWY_MoeY" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz County Health website</a> to find a location providing them in your area.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are providing a limited number of at-home COVID-19 testing kits to employees before Winter Break. The kits are available free of charge on a first-come, first-serve basis, and you may pick them up between Dec. 10-22 at the Scotts Valley or Silicon Valley reception desks (Scotts Valley is closed between 12-1 p.m. for lunch) or the Bay Tree Bookstore. <strong>Please note that we can only provide one kit per employee and it is intended for use <em>before</em> you return to campus. </strong>We cannot provide test kits to employees who are 100% remote. These at-home COVID testing kits are available for purchase at local pharmacies.</p>
<h2>While Traveling</h2>
<p>If you plan to travel over the Winter Break, please familiarize yourself with the latest CDC guidelines and requirements for minimizing COVID infection risk at the time of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/celebrations.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CRcEz6nb0Dyn0RIjjCB10" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/celebrations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">holiday celebrations</a> . For example, you need to wear a face covering while on a plane or other form of public transportation or around a family member who is immune-compromised if you are gathering indoors.</p>
<h2>Upon Returning to Campus</h2>
<p><strong>For ALL employees,</strong> you will need to complete the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638925795854000&amp;usg=AOvVaw15lpw0tlKTqrNELyVEUnYD" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily symptom checker</a> once you return to campus.</p>
<p><strong>For fully vaccinated employees,</strong> pre-arrival testing is <em>not required</em> but is advised before returning to campus.</p>
<p><strong>For unvaccinated employees,</strong> pre-arrival testing is <em>not required</em> but is strongly advised. <strong>Additionally, for unvaccinated employees, an on-site test is required on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, or your first day of return to on-site work</strong> . After your initial on-site test, you will need to resume the testing cadence of at least once every 4 days.</p>
<p><strong>We recommend that all employees</strong> self-monitor for any COVID-like symptoms within 7 days of their return as a best practice. Please notify your medical provider if needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and efforts for the health of our campus community.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best in the New Year.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff</audience><admin>Sarah Latham  Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a50daae7807270462612537c9009ec90"><name>summer-session-classes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2022 Summer Session courses listed </title><summary>The majority of course offerings for UC Santa Cruz Summer Session are now listed at summer.ucsc.edu.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hundreds of choices, from topical priorities like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Activism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemics: Case Studies in Public Health</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to diverse fields like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">History of Hip Hop</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Games as Visual Culture. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is also offering engaging and hands-on classes, too, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvisation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing Science Fiction, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gamelan Ensemble - </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well as foundational courses in math, sciences, psychology, and economics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our main priority continues to be offering courses UCSC students need for their degree progress,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;The fact that the summer quarter is open to everyone also enables us to welcome a diverse group of students visiting from other colleges, universities, and high schools.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most courses are five credits and take place during accelerated five-week sessions. Eligible high school students get half off tuition to encourage college preparation and major exploration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With multiple sessions, summer allows students ample time to study with world-class instructors, while still working, interning, or taking a break.&#160;</span></p>

<p>UCSC's continued success in attracting funding for research and education has led to steady growth in grants and contracts over the past five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The range of research and creative work of the UCSC faculty, researchers, and those engaged in educational programs continues to be recognized through contract and grant support from a range of federal and state agencies and private foundations. It is a testament to the creativity and dedication of all on campus who are engaged in and support research,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan.</p>
<p>As in past years, the National Institutes of Health was the single largest funding source ($51.6 million), followed by the National Science Foundation ($20.5 million) and the Department of Education ($17.3 million). The Heising-Simons Foundation was the campus's largest source of private funding, with awards totaling more than $2.8 million.</p>
<p>The top research awards included a $7.9 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for particle physics research and a $5.7 million grant from NOAA&#8217;s National Marine Fisheries Service for fisheries ecology research.

Scientists have long recognized that a single reference genome cannot represent human diversity and that using it introduces a pervasive bias into these studies. Now, they finally have a practical alternative.</p>
<p>In a paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg8871">published December 16 in <em>Science</em></a>, researchers at the <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> have introduced a new tool, called Giraffe, that can efficiently map new genome sequences to a &#8220;pangenome&#8221; representing many diverse human genome sequences. They show that this approach allows a more comprehensive characterization of genetic variations and can improve the genomic analyses used by a wide range of researchers and clinicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working toward this for years, and now for the first time we have something practical that works fast and works better than the single reference genome,&#8221; said corresponding author Benedict Paten, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and associate director of the Genomics Institute. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for the future of biomedicine that genomics helps everyone equally, so we need tools that account for the diversity of human populations and are not biased.&#8221;</p>
<p>All humans have the same genes, but there are many variations in the exact sequences of the genes&#8212;meaning the sequence of DNA subunits (abbreviated A, C, T, G) that spell out the genetic code&#8212;as well as in the vast stretches of the genome outside of the protein-coding genes. A difference in a single letter of code is called a single nucleotide variant (SNV), and insertions or deletions of short sequences are known collectively as &#8220;indels&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Structural variations</h2>
<p>The most complex variants are structural variations involving rearrangements of large segments of code (50 or more letters). These are especially hard to find using a single reference genome, yet they can have significant effects and are known to play an important role in some diseases. The average person has millions of SNVs and indels and tens of thousands of larger structural variants, and collectively the structural variants actually involve more letters of code than the other types of variants do.</p>
<p>&#8220;The workhorses of genomics have been SNVs and short indels, because structural variants have been hidden from view,&#8221; Paten said. &#8220;Pangenomics is making structural variants visible so we can study them the same way we do SNVs and short indels. There are a lot of structural variants and they can have a big impact, so this is critical for the future of genetic studies of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pangenome reference can be created from multiple genome sequences using a mathematical graph structure to represent the relationships between different sequences. In the new paper, the researchers built two human genome reference graphs using publicly available data. These were used to evaluate the new tool, Giraffe, which is a set of algorithms for mapping new sequence data to a pangenome reference.</p>
<p>First author Jouni Sir&#233;n, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute, pioneered many of Giraffe&#8217;s key algorithmic innovations. Giraffe can accurately map new sequence data to thousands of genomes embedded in a pangenome reference as quickly as existing tools map to a single reference genome. The study also showed that using Giraffe reduces mapping bias, the tendency to incorrectly map sequences that differ from the reference genome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only is the analysis better, it is also as fast as current methods that use a linear reference genome,&#8221; said co-first author Jean Monlong, a postdoctoral researcher at the Genomics Institute.</p>
<h2>Genotyping</h2>
<p>Inexpensive short-read sequencing is a mainstay of modern genomics, yielding snippets of sequence that must be mapped to a reference genome to make sense of them. Mapping shows where each snippet belongs on one of the 23 human chromosomes and identifies the variants present at each location in an individual&#8217;s genome, a process known as genotyping.</p>
<p>The researchers found that Google Health&#8217;s deep-learning variant caller, DeepVariant, could more accurately identify SNVs and indels using Giraffe&#8217;s alignments against a pangenome than it could using alignments against a single reference genome.</p>
<p>Monlong said he was most excited about using pangenomics to study structural variants.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of structural variants have been discovered recently using long-read sequencing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With pangenomes, we can look for these structural variants in large datasets of short-read sequencing. It's exciting because this will allow us to study those new structural variants across many people and ask questions about their functional impact, association with disease, or role in evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers used Giraffe to map sequence reads from a diverse group of 5,202 people and determine their genotypes for 167,000 recently discovered structural variations. This enabled them to estimate the frequency of different versions of these structural variants in the human population as a whole and within individual subpopulations. They showed that the frequency of some variants differs considerably between subpopulations and could be misinterpreted if analyzed only in, for example, European-ancestry populations where the frequency of a particular variant is low.</p>
<p>A single reference genome must choose one version of any variation to represent, leaving the other versions unrepresented. By making more broadly representative pangenome references practical, Giraffe can make genomics more inclusive.</p>
<p>Paten and others at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute are involved in a major effort funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute to build a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html">comprehensive human pangenome reference</a>, which they expect to release next year as a resource for the scientific community.</p>

Niebanck taught urban and environmental planning at UC Santa Cruz for 20 years before his retirement in 1993.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niebanck was born in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and grew up in the Hudson River Valley in New York. He was legally blind from birth. Niebanck studied at Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, and Graduate Theological Union and held academic positions at University of Pennsylvania, UC Santa Cruz, University of Washington, and Portland State University over the course of his career. In the early 1970s, he also worked in the federal government as deputy assistant secretary in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niebanck joined UC Santa Cruz in 1973 to serve as the founding provost of what was then College 8. He held that role for three years before moving on to become UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first vice chancellor for student affairs. He would also later serve for two years as chair of the Academic Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his tenure at UC Santa Cruz, Niebanck moved to Seattle and became a visiting distinguished professor at Portland State University. In 2002, he received the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning Distinguished Educator Award. Niebanck also maintained connections with the UC Santa Cruz campus community for many years following his retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://emeriti.ucsc.edu/files/UCSCEA%20Newsletter1-1.pdf?a=newsletter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the UCSC Emeriti Association newsletter in 2018, Niebanck wrote, &#8220;I enjoyed every minute of my time at UCSC.&#8221; And regarding his retirement from the faculty, he wrote, &#8220;Immediately and since then, I have missed my colleagues and the unique UCSC commitment to teaching and learning.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, during the Rachel Carson College dedication, Niebanck shared his fond memories of the early days of College 8 via a letter that was read aloud at the ceremony. As reported by </span><a href="https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2016/10/14/the-dedication-of-rachel-carson/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">City On A Hill Press</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Niebanck&#8217;s letter discussed how the college&#8217;s faculty and students &#8220;turned it into a place of beauty and celebration.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time as the college dedication, a group of Niebanck&#8217;s former students and friends came together to establish and endow the </span><a href="https://rachelcarson.ucsc.edu/academics/Niebanck.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Niebanck Founder&#8217;s Prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Rachel Carson College in Niebanck&#8217;s honor. Each year, the fund awards a $2,500 prize to a UCSC student whose work contributes original and innovative insight into environmental analysis and planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niebanck&#8217;s legacy has also inspired his former students to help fund experiential education. In 2011, when years of state budget cuts had threatened the Environmental Studies Department&#8217;s capacity to continue offering field-based courses, faculty and alumni came together to raise funding for an </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/12/Environmental-Studies-experiential-education.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiential learning endowment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among the donations that helped to build momentum was a $10,000 gift from College Eight environmental planning alumnus and 2011 Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award winner Peter Stein, who contributed in honor of Niebanck and Professor Emeritus James Pepper.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niebanck&#8217;s memory will live on at UC Santa Cruz through his many former students and colleagues and through the institutions and programs that he helped to shape. He is survived by his partner of six decades, Linda, along with three children and five grandchildren.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bb39466e807270462612537c3d61989f"><name>cacsw-applications</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Advisory Committee on the Status of Womxn inviting new members</title><summary>Our CACSW welcomes interest and nominations for the roles secretary/treasurer and member(s)-at-large.

Coastal wetlands also provide habitat for fish and other wildlife, reduce erosion and coastal flooding, improve water quality, and support recreational uses.</p>
<p>Recognition of these &#8220;ecosystem services,&#8221; coupled with widespread loss and degradation of coastal wetlands, has spurred restoration efforts throughout California and around the world. Little is known, however, about how specific restoration and management practices influence the capture and storage of carbon (&#8220;carbon sequestration&#8221;) and other benefits of coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>Now, a large interdisciplinary team of scientists is working to develop policy and management guidelines to maximize carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands along with other benefits for humans and nature. Led by Adina Paytan, a research scientist at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences, the collaborative project involves researchers at five UC campuses and three national laboratories and is funded by a $3.6 million grant from the UC National Laboratory Fees Research Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering California&#8217;s goal of achieving carbon neutrality, there is no way we can do that without sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and nature-based solutions like wetland restoration are among the most economical and effective strategies,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;This project will evaluate how coastal wetland restoration can be designed and executed in a way that will provide the most benefits for people and ecosystems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Components of the project include research on carbon dynamics in coastal wetlands; economic assessment of carbon storage and other ecosystem services from coastal wetlands; development of a policy and governance framework for wetland restoration; and incorporating carbon dynamics, restoration options, and climate trends in ecosystem models to improve projections of carbon sequestration benefits from coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>The project brings together UC experts in these areas at the Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Davis, Santa Barbara, and Irvine campuses, as well as scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Field research will take place at wetland sites in San Francisco Bay, the Delta, and Elkhorn Slough, taking advantage of existing research infrastructure where Paytan and other investigators have ongoing research programs.</p>
<p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, incorporating carbon into organic matter. Burial of that carbon in soils and sediments can sequester it, but decomposition processes can release it back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. Understanding and quantifying the processes that govern the net burial rates of carbon in coastal wetlands is crucial for designing the most effective restoration and management practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to know how to maximize burial and minimize emissions in a way that is sustainable over the long run, especially with sea level rise,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;You have to look at all the variables together to see the net effect, and none of this has been modeled in a holistic way. That&#8217;s where the national labs come in, because they have these wonderful ecosystem modeling tools that will be really useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The contributions of social scientists to the project are also crucial, she said. Quantifying wetland ecosystem services will enable the economic value of carbon storage and other benefits to be included in decisions on wetland restoration and support wider use of nature-based solutions for climate mitigation. The project will also integrate environmental justice considerations, policy, and governance approaches to develop a framework and guidelines for incorporating coastal wetland restoration and conservation into local, state, and national plans for climate adaptation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to know as scientists what we need to do, but we also need to understand what the implications are to people and how to navigate a complex regulatory system and actually achieve our goals,&#8221; Paytan said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with some of the investigators before on wetlands research, but we realized this needed a bigger project involving social scientists as well. When I started reaching out, it was really nice because everyone recognized how important this is and they were excited to contribute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The close collaboration of researchers from different disciplines is essential for developing sustainable climate mitigation solutions that enhance community resilience and environmental justice. The funding for this project will support graduate and undergraduate student researchers as well as education and outreach components such as an undergraduate course on climate and data literacy offered at the participating UC campuses.</p>
<p>The UC National Laboratory Fees Research Program enhances partnerships between UC researchers and scientists at national laboratories. Funds for these strategic investments derive from the net fee income UC receives for managing the Los Alamos, Lawrence Berkeley, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

the recipients of the 2021 CITRIS Seed Awards from the <a href="https://citris.sites.ucsc.edu/">Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute (CITRIS)</a>.</p>
<p>Out of 47 proposals for innovative, early-stage projects that emphasize collaboration across two or more institutions, 13 UC teams were selected to each receive a one-time award of up to $60,000 for interdisciplinary work. These projects are designed to show results within a year, but many promise far-reaching influence on the future of their fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to support these innovative multidisciplinary proposals that demonstrate not only the bold ideas of UC faculty members but the power of forging partnerships across campuses to advance technology solutions for some of the most pressing issues of our day,&#8221; said CITRIS Director Costas Spanos.</p>
<p>The selected proposals address grand challenges, including digital health innovation and wildfire mitigation. Just as their proposals tackle critical problems in innovative ways, the teams feature faculty members from diverse fields.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the CITRIS Seed Funding program has supported more than 235 projects and over 425 researchers, resulting in extramural funding up to four times the initial investment within three years of completion. CITRIS Seed Awards facilitate the scientific groundwork, data collection, and prototyping necessary to pursue larger research or commercialization awards that address major unsolved challenges.</p>
<p>The following 2021 awards involve faculty in the <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Persistent, autonomous, patient-centered monitoring and its application to pressure injury prevention</strong></p>
<p><em>Principal Investigators:</em> Katia Obraczka (Lead PI, UC Santa Cruz), Sarina Fazio (UC Davis Health), Holly Kirkland-Kyhn (UC Davis Health)</p>
<p>Low-mobility individuals are disproportionately affected by pressure ulcers and injuries, wounds that develop in localized areas of tissue and can take years to heal. This open-source project based on the Internet of Things (IoT) will integrate vital sign sensors and surfaces such as mattresses or wheelchairs into a patient monitoring framework. The resulting system is designed to operate autonomously and continuously, with real-time data collection, storage, and analysis. Given the system&#8217;s ability to detect conditions early, its immediate visual feedback, and its integration of different sensors based on a patient&#8217;s individual health conditions, this project has the potential to significantly improve telehealth treatment, patient well-being, and health care costs.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual evacuation decision-making under fire threat for personal property and transportation decisions</strong></p>
<p>Principal Investigators: Spencer Castro (Lead PI, UC Merced), Sri Kurniawan (UC Santa Cruz)</p>
<p>Given the devastating breadth of wildfires across 12 states in 2020, and the increasing prevalence of fires in locations with historically lower danger, more people are being exposed to fires at the wildland-urban interface. Many people in these locations are unaware of the dangers of wildfires and unprepared to evacuate their homes. This project plans to develop a platform for public fire training through immersive virtual environments for greater accessibility and evacuation decision-making under time pressure. The platform will help determine which sensory metrics best predict performance for these types of decisions and accurately represent real-time cognition. This technology will help civilians evacuate their homes more efficiently and, ultimately, help save lives.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://citris-uc.org/13-cross-campus-projects-selected-for-2021-seed-awards/</url><title>2021 CITRIS Seed Awards</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf6c773a807270462612537c83ecf167"><name>sawyer-seminar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz receives Mellon Foundation humanities grant to investigate race, biomedicine</title><summary>Faculty and students at UC Santa Cruz will critically investigate the relationships among medicine, race, and the environment both in the United States and in other regions of the globe shaped by the influence of American medicine. &#13;

Mellon Foundation, faculty and students at UC Santa Cruz will have a chance to critically investigate the relationships among medicine, race, and the environment both in the United States and in other regions of the globe shaped by the influence of American medicine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $225,000 award will support &#8220;Race, Empire, and the Environments of Biomedicine,&#8221; a Sawyer Seminar on the Comparative Study of Culture, that, starting in Fall 2022, will bring scientists, physicians, and scholars of the humanities and social sciences together with students and members of the UC Santa Cruz community for a series of public lectures, reading groups, and research fellowships at the graduate and postdoctoral levels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to create a larger conversation about how assumptions about race and the environment are built into the knowledge and practice of American medicine," said Jennifer Derr, associate professor of history, the founding director of the Center for the Middle East and North Africa at UC Santa Cruz, and the seminar&#8217;s primary Principal Investigator. &#8220;We think that it&#8217;s important to understand the history and the practice of these relationships to advocate for a more equitable practice of medicine and one that is prepared to address the threats of climate change.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is an extraordinary example of the genuinely interdisciplinary, yet deeply grounded work that makes UC Santa Cruz such an innovative and intellectually exciting place,&#8221; said Nathaniel Deutsch, faculty director for The Humanities Institute.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derr is joined by Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology, the founding director of the Science and Justice Research Center at UC Santa Cruz, and the project&#8217;s other Principal Investigator. Maya Peterson, an associate professor of history at UC Santa Cruz, who died in childbirth in June 2021 was also a Principal Investigator. Peterson was the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe Dreams:</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water and Empire in Central Asia </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cambridge, 2019).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scope of this upcoming project is appropriately wide, encompassing, among other subjects, the effects of structural racism on the practice of biomedicine, how communities of color adapt and cope during times of environmental crisis, how climate change may impact the practice of biomedicine, and how capitalism in America &#8211; and in the geographies of its empire &#8211; influences global public health.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to create a new kind of intellectual space that will help cultivate an intellectual community and a community of young scholars,&#8221; said Reardon. &#8220;It&#8217;s a real opportunity for us to turn Santa Cruz into a hub for national and international discussion on these topics.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issues being raised dovetail with the research that both Reardon and Derr have undertaken in recent months, making them ideal leads for this project. Derr&#8217;s scholarship explores the intersections among science, medicine, and the environment. She is currently researching a book project concerning the history of liver disease in Egypt and how its treatment has been linked to formations of American biomedical empire. Reardon is known for her research on the ethics and inequalities of modern genome research. Over the last couple of years, she has begun a project entitled&#160;</span><a href="https://caringforprairie.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caring for Prairie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;that is exploring questions at the intersection of race, environment and health on the grasslands of the Central plains of the U.S. &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the team behind this project are making final decisions about which outside scholars they will be inviting to UC Santa Cruz for public lectures and collaboration, as well as preparing to issue a call to recruit two UCSC graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow from outside the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The point here is to think together about the connections among race, environment, medicine, and empire,&#8221; Derr said. As Reardon notes &#8220;This is an exciting opportunity for young scholars to work in this area and to have a very supportive intellectual community around them.&#8221; The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant will be administered by The Humanities Institute (THI) at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf995d6a807270462612537c25f825f8"><name>covid-19-lab</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Lab to end COVID testing amid regulatory changes</title><summary>With widespread COVID-19 testing available and significant changes to the regulatory landscape for emergency testing facilities, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said this is the right moment to end the lab’s work in testing for COVID-19 and begin a planned transition to focusing on pediatric cancer genomics.</summary><start-date>1639555200000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 Lab</display-name><path>/2021/12/covid-19-lab</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/covid-19-lab</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1639597038935</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1639597744731</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/09/images/covid-lab-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/09/images/covid-lab-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>covid-lab-400.jpg</name><display-name>covid-lab-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>82469</file-size><width>400</width><height>284</height></image><image-alt>Lab worker operating equipment</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/covid-lab-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/covid-lab-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>covid-lab-80.jpg</name><display-name>covid-lab-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>17763</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Lab worker operating equipment</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Providing fast and easy testing for COVID-19&#8212;and in some situations requiring it&#8212;remains a foundational element of the university&#8217;s ability to support in-person learning, teaching and operations.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz will continue to regularly provide free on-site testing to its campus community through a commercial vendor</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After running more than 160,000 tests for COVID-19, the UC Santa Cruz Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory will wind down its support of COVID-19 testing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With widespread COVID-19 testing available and significant changes to the regulatory landscape for emergency testing facilities, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said this is the right moment to end the lab&#8217;s work in testing for COVID-19 and begin a planned transition to focusing on pediatric cancer genomics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We take incredible pride in all the hard work that went into creating and running this lab,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;Our faculty and staff saw that UC Santa Cruz could fill a critical need to support the health of our campus and local community. I remain inspired by what they accomplished.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz will continue to regularly provide free on-site testing to its campus community through a commercial vendor. Providing fast and easy testing for COVID-19&#8212;and in some situations requiring it&#8212;remains a foundational element of the university&#8217;s ability to support in-person learning, teaching and operations. To date, there have been no identified cases of spread in classrooms or campus work sites. The campus continues to have an extremely low positivity rate of 0.59 percent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kletzer said the campus remains dedicated to serving the Santa Cruz region and is planning to continue sequencing positive COVID-19 tests for the California Department of Public Health and the local community to monitor when variants&#8212;such as Omicron&#8212;are found in the Santa Cruz community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff established the lab in May 2020, just months after the pandemic disrupted nearly all aspects of society. At the time, opportunities to get tested for COVID-19 were scarce and often the results took a week or more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the lab opened, the team of faculty and staff turned their attention to carefully scaling the operations, creating an opportunity to serve the local community. With the support of Community Foundation Santa Cruz County, the lab began to process samples for the two largest community clinics in the county, Santa Cruz Community Health and Salud Para La Gente. The lab, operating at the time as the Molecular Diagnostic Lab, also began providing test results for other high-risk populations in the community, such as the Santa Cruz County Jail and the Santa Cruz County Probation Department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A generous gift from Bud and Rebecca Colligan in December 2020 enabled the construction of a new, dedicated laboratory space to house the diagnostic lab at the Westside Research Park that would support COVID-19 testing and later transition to pediatric genomics diagnostics. The Colligans also provided support for a pediatric genomics chair. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At capacity, the lab was processing 5,000 tests per week for both the campus and the community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The CCDL has made critical contributions to the health of the campus and the greater Santa Cruz County Community through access to high quality, fast turnaround testing,&#8221; said interim Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan. &#8220;We are grateful to all of the staff, faculty and students that have contributed to the success of the lab over the last 18 months.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4ac77a1807270462612537c5ddd7fcd"><name>in-memoriam-tyler-stovall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tyler Stovall, renowned history professor and former humanities dean, dies at 67</title><summary>Stovall was a faculty member of the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division for 13 years, including three years serving as the chair of the History Department and provost of Stevenson College.</summary><start-date>1639641600000</start-date><display-name>In memoriam</display-name><path>/2021/12/in-memoriam-tyler-stovall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/in-memoriam-tyler-stovall</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1639682176906</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1639694947638</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Robert Ham</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/tyler-stovall-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/tyler-stovall-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tyler-stovall-500px.jpg</name><display-name>tyler-stovall-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>133719</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Tyler Stovall standing during an event</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/tyler-stovall-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/tyler-stovall-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tyler-stovall-80px.jpg</name><display-name>tyler-stovall-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12378</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tyler Stovall standing during an event</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>In 1996, Tyler Stovall made a splash with the publication of his book <em>Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light</em>, a work that explored the lives of the many Black writers, artists, and performers from America whose work flourished after emigrating to France in the 20th century.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Stovall was among the first African Americans in the U.S. to achieve prominence as a European history scholar</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Stovall, a renowned historian, professor, and former Dean of Humanities at UC Santa Cruz, died Dec. 10, 2021 at his home in New York City. He was 67.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stovall was the author of 10 books and various articles on modern French history, with a focus on labor, colonialism, race, with his latest&#8212;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea&#8212;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">published in early 2021. Stovall was a faculty member of the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division for 13 years, including three years serving as the chair of the History Department and provost of Stevenson College. His tenure as Dean of Humanities at UC Santa Cruz lasted from 2014-2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An insightful scholar and author dedicated to social justice and the advancement of minority scholars, Tyler touched the lives of countless students, faculty and staff in his nearly two decades on our campus,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said in a joint campus message. &#8220;We knew Tyler as a skilled educator and as a thoughtful, generous, and kind colleague. He will be missed tremendously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his time at UC Santa Cruz, Stovall&#8217;s long and distinguished career found him serving as president of the American Historical Association and as a visiting professor at the Universit&#233; de Polyn&#233;sie Fran&#231;aise in Tahiti, as well as taking teaching positions at Ohio State University and as both a professor of French history and dean of the Undergraduate Division of the College of Letters and Science at UC Berkeley. At the time of his death, Stovall was serving as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Fordham University in New York City.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A man of deep conviction and penetrating insight, Tyler was a great mind, a great heart, and a kind and generous colleague,&#8221; Joseph M. McShane, S.J., President of Fordham University, said in a statement. &#8220;He came to Fordham in July 2020, and during his too-brief tenure brought tremendous intellectual acumen, energy, and gravitas to the role. He was an experienced and capable administrator and a highly regarded historian and public intellectual with a fierce commitment to social justice and the advancement of minority scholars.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stovall was among the first African Americans in the U.S. to achieve prominence as a European history scholar, and he provided encouragement and mentorship for other minority scholars. He spoke eloquently throughout his career about the importance and value of diversity, noting that while people often talk about diversity as being important for marginalized communities, it is something that benefits all of us. &#8220;Being exposed to people from different backgrounds, being able to interact with people with different experiences is something that we all learn from and it makes all of our lives better,&#8221; he said in a short video on excellence and diversity produced by Fordham University earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stovall was born on Sept. 4, 1954, in Gallipolis, Ohio to parents Tyler and Barbara Stovall. His father was a child psychologist, and his mother directed the South Side Settlement House, a community center in Columbus, Ohio. Both of Stovall&#8217;s parents were active in the growing civil rights movement, with activists and guests of their local NAACP chapter visiting their home regularly. Their efforts inspired Stovall&#8217;s own political activism, including joining a Race Relations Club at his public high school and giving his first public speech against the war in Vietnam at age 18.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stovall attended Harvard, graduating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cum laude</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a degree in history. He continued participating in antiwar and anti-racist protests and was, at one point, attacked on a public street with acid sprayed in his face. It thankfully didn&#8217;t cause any physical damage. He went from Harvard to graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he narrowed his interest in European history to modern French history under the tutelage of noted scholar Harvey Goldberg.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stovall soon earned awards and grants that allowed him to pursue his research into working class neighborhoods in Paris&#8217;s suburbs, in particular the work being done to turn citizens frustrated with the sanitation and water systems into a vibrant electoral base. This resulted in his 1984 dissertation, &#8220;The Urbanization of Bobigny,&#8221; which was eventually revised and published in book form as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise of the Paris Red Belt</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of California Press in 1990.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning his PhD in modern European/French history in 1984, Stovall continued to research his dissertation, earning a fellowship that took him to UC Berkeley. It was there that he met Denise Herd, a fellow scholar whom he married in 1988. That same year, Stovall took a position in the history department at UC Santa Cruz where his courses homed in on race and ethnicity in Europe and modern France.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1996, Stovall made a splash with the publication of his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a work that explored the lives of the many Black writers, artists, and performers from America whose work flourished after emigrating to France in the 20th century. The book was praised as &#8220;an engaging chronicle of African-American life in Paris since the dawn of the Jazz Age,&#8221; by Kirkus Reviews. The book also served as vital source material for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myth of a Colorblind France</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 2020 documentary film for which Stovall was interviewed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His most recent book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earned Stovall even more attention and acclaim. Numerous critics connected the book&#8217;s theme that, as Stovall writes, &#8220;at its most extreme freedom can be and historically has been a racist ideology,&#8221; with the January 6 attack on the U.S. capitol. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has much to tell us&#8230; about how racism has been built into so many of our systems and institutions, and about how what we see as freedom isn&#8217;t really freedom at all,&#8221; wrote Brock Kingsley in a piece written for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Review of Books</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, Tyler should be remembered as a scholar who firmly believed that the writing and teaching of history was a political act,&#8221; said Michael Vann, professor of history and Asian studies at California State University, Sacramento, who studied under Stovall for his PhD at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Throughout his long and vibrant career, Tyler used his path breaking research, critical analysis, and engaging lectures as weapons in the fight for social justice. Despite studying some of the worst aspects of human behavior, he always remained optimistic and held that a better world was possible, and that education was central to that goal. I&#8217;m heartbroken to lose him as a friend and a mentor, but also as a role model in our unfinished struggles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his wife, Denise Herd, Tyler Stovall is survived by their son, Justin; and a sister, Leslie Stovall.

She was 69.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">hooks was the author of over two dozen books that ranged from the groundbreaking text </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ain&#8217;t I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to her deeply felt memoir </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to her acclaimed children&#8217;s book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy To Be Nappy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was also a proud graduate of UC Santa Cruz, earning a doctorate in literature in 1983 with her dissertation on Toni Morrison. &#8220;It was here as a graduate that I dared to dream beyond the fate that was designated for me as a Black woman,&#8221; hooks said during a 2007 lecture she gave on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her career has been extraordinary,&#8221; said Bettina Aptheker, a longtime friend of hooks and Distinguished Professor of Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I know from teaching her work in my classes what an enormous, and lasting impact her writing has had on generations of our students&#8212;and on generations of scholar-activists across our country and the globe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born Gloria Jean Watkins on September 25, 1952, hooks grew up in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Her parents, Rosa Bell Watkins and Veodis Watkins, were a homemaker and a postal worker, respectively. As a child, hooks showed a hunger for knowledge, spending all of her free time reading and dreaming about leaving her hometown.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As her siblings said in a statement following hooks&#8217; death, &#8220;Gloria learned to read and write at an early age and even proclaimed she would be famous one day. Every night we would try to sleep, but the sounds of her writing or page turning caused us to yell down to Mom to make her turn the light off.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">hooks eventually landed at Stanford University, where she earned a degree in English literature in 1974. Her studies continued at University of Wisconsin, from which she obtained a master&#8217;s degree in English in 1976.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, hooks began her career as an educator at the University of Southern California, where she was a senior lecturer in ethnic studies and a professor of English. It was during her time there that she adopted the pen name bell hooks for a chapbook of poems, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And There We Wept. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she has often repeated, it was chosen in honor of her maternal great-grandmother and set in lowercase letters to put the emphasis on her writing rather than her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first major work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ain&#8217;t I a Woman?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was published in 1981, though she began drafting it during her time at Stanford. The book, which borrowed a line from a famous speech from Sojourner Truth in support of women&#8217;s suffrage, explored the impact of slavery on the ongoing maltreatment of Black women in America. &#8220;A devaluation of black womanhood occurred as a result of the sexual exploitation of black women during slavery that has not altered in the course of hundreds of years,&#8221; hooks wrote in the book.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book was praised as groundbreaking upon its publication and has since become a canonical text in the study of feminist theory. As author Min Jin Lee put it in a 2019 essay on hooks, written for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;For me, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aint I a Woman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was as if someone had opened the door, the windows, and raised the roof in my mind. I am neither white nor black, but through her theories, I was able to understand that my body contained historical multitudes and any analysis without such a measured consideration was limited and deeply flawed.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, hooks went on to produce many more books, including the award-winning 1991 work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; 1995&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art on my mind: visual politics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feminism is for everybody: passionate politics, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">published in 2000, with a number of them becoming required reading in high schools and colleges around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to quantify her impact, it&#8217;s been so immense,&#8221; said Robin Kilson, then an associate professor of history and women&#8217;s studies at MIT, in a 1995 article on hooks from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronicle of Higher Education</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Is there any other black woman author who turns up on as many bibliographies? The answer is &#8216;No.&#8217; She&#8217;s everywhere.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her steady stream of writing work, hooks maintained a vibrant career in academia. She served as a professor of English and African and Afro-American studies at Yale, was associate professor of American literature and women&#8217;s studies at Oberlin College, and was a distinguished professor of English at City University of New York. Since 2004, she was a Distinguished Professor in Residence in Appalachian Studies at Berea College in Berea, Kentucky and helped establish the bell hooks Institute there for students to study her writing and teaching work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Reciting bell hooks&#8217; academic milestones doesn&#8217;t do justice to the influential reach of her writing spanning 40 years,&#8221; said Literature Department Chair Carla Freccero. &#8220;Her work was always accessible, sometimes difficult, always passionate, lively and honest. Most women I know can remember at what point in their lives they read which books, which essays, and how that experience of reading changed their lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">hooks is survived by her four sisters, Sarah Chambers, Angela Malone, Gwenda Motley, and Valeria Watkins, as well as her brother, Kenneth Watkins.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c9429343807270462612537c80cd0610"><name>rippled-sheets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mirror-image peptides form ‘rippled sheet’ structure predicted in 1953</title><summary>A UCSC team obtained an x-ray ‘snapshot’ of a novel protein structure with potential applications in biomedicine and materials science.</summary><keywords>Jevgenij Raskatov, Timothy Johnstone</keywords><start-date>1639728000000</start-date><display-name>Mirror-image peptides form ‘rippled sheet’ structure predicted in 1953</display-name><path>/2021/12/rippled-sheets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/rippled-sheets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1639759123250</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1639759716509</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/cover-image-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/cover-image-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-410.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>89008</file-size><width>410</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>chalk drawing of chemical structure</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/12/images/cover-image-thumb1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/12/images/cover-image-thumb1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-thumb1.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20199</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>chalk drawing of chemical structure</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This illustration shows the &#8220;left-handed&#8221; and &#8220;right-handed&#8221; triphenylalanine peptides which bond together to form a rippled beta sheet.

They reported their findings in a paper <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2021/SC/D1SC05731F">published December 8 in <em>Chemical Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>The rippled sheet is a distinctive variation on the pleated beta sheet, which is a well-known structural motif found in thousands of proteins, including important disease-related proteins. Linus Pauling and Robert Corey described the rippled beta sheet in 1953, two years after introducing the concept of the pleated beta sheet.</p>
<p>While the pleated beta sheet (often called simply the beta sheet) quickly became a textbook example of a common protein structure, the rippled sheet has languished in obscurity as a rarely studied and largely theoretical structure. Previous studies have found experimental evidence of rippled sheet formation, but none using x-ray crystallography, which is the gold standard for determining protein structures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, for the first time, we have the crystal structure of a rippled sheet, which is like a snapshot of it, and the structure closely matches the predictions of Pauling and Corey,&#8221; said Jevgenij Raskatov, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rippled sheet paradigm may have significance for both materials research and biomedical applications, and having the crystal structure is important for the rational design of rippled sheet materials,&#8221; Raskatov noted.</p>
<p>Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids folded into complex three-dimensional shapes that enable them to carry out a huge variety of functions in all living things. A pleated beta sheet is composed of linear strands (called beta strands) bonded together side by side to form a 2-dimensional sheet-like structure. A rippled beta sheet is similar except that alternate strands are mirror images of each other.</p>
<p>The amino acids that make up proteins can have either a &#8220;left-handed&#8221; (L) or &#8220;right-handed&#8221; (D) orientation in the arrangement of their atoms&#8212;the same in all respects but mirror images, like left and right hands. All natural proteins are made with left-handed amino acids, but synthetic proteins can be made with either L or D amino acids.</p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers used mirror-image forms of triphenylalanine, a short peptide consisting of three phenylalanine amino acids. When mixed in equal amounts, the mirror-image peptides joined in pairs, which then packed together into herringbone layer structures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They pack together to form a crystal, so we could use x-ray crystallography to see that rippled sheet structure,&#8221; said coauthor Timothy Johnstone, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry. &#8220;It&#8217;s a highly enabling discovery that opens up new avenues for exploration, because it gives us a new building block, or a new way to put building blocks together, for creating novel polypeptide structures with desirable properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having determined the crystal structure, the researchers then searched the Protein Data Bank, an online archive of structural data, for other proteins involving mirror-image peptides. They found three additional crystal structures containing rippled sheets that had not been recognized when the structures were originally analyzed.</p>
<p>The co-first authors of the paper are Ariel Kuhn, a Ph.D. student in Raskatov&#8217;s lab, and Beatriz Ehlke, a Ph.D. student in the lab of coauthor Scott Oliver, professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great collaborative effort between the three labs, as well as demonstrating the incredible capabilities of our new single crystal XRD instrument for x-ray crystallography,&#8221; Kuhn said.</p>

<p>When Bill passed away, the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz lost one of its most versatile and astute astrophysicists. With deep scientific curiosity and an endless enthusiasm for discovery, he vigorously continued his research until his final days. His contributions have had an everlasting impact in our field. Always magnanimous with his time, Bill was an inspirational colleague and teacher who shaped the careers of all of us fortunate enough to reside within his sphere of influence. His passing is deeply felt.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Bill showed an exceptional ability to identify the roads less traveled. I greatly admired his style of trailblazing reasoning coupled with kindness and endless humility. Bill simply saw, and then brilliantly pursued, promising pathways that others did not. And in many cases others could not even pursue them, as Bill combined his novel ideas with technical mastery in the implementation.</p>
<p>Bill is most well known for his work on understanding the role, state, and history of gas in the universe. Shortly after its birth, the universe was loaded with gas, mainly hydrogen. In due course, far and wide, gravity drew the gas into clouds which transformed them into galaxies whereupon stars lit. Stars glow by nuclear burning of the gas, and those that end their lives in bright explosions help blow the gas back out of galaxies. As such, galaxies are embedded in a tub of gas, the medium from which they were born and which ultimately powers them. They breathe gas in and out, and their stars glow until their gas is gone.</p>
<p>This was one of Bill&#8217;s groundbreaking theories, and his classic paper set the course for a lifetime of research. The challenge with verifying his theory was that fifty years ago instruments were unable to detect signs of gas in galaxies, let alone map its comings and goings. With more sensitive instruments and resolute surveys, we now know much more. Persuasive evidence suggests that, as envisioned by Bill, galaxies subsist by recycling gas into and out of stars. And we also have precursory proof for how galaxies might run out of gas, stop forming stars, and die.</p>
<p>Most of what we astronomers understand about the universe originates from what we are able to observe. So our ideas have been biased toward galaxies and stars, which are luminous. But most of the ordinary matter in the universe is in the form of gas, which is faint and difficult to see. Gas, termed the intergalactic medium, floods the space between galaxies, while the gas of the circumgalactic medium resides closer in, encircling galaxies. The gas in both places regulates the birth, life, and death of the galaxies, and holds a detailed narrative of the universe. Only lately have astronomers been able to detect it. Bill always had the remarkable ability to be way ahead of the game, forecasting many key astronomical discoveries.</p>
<p>Observers commonly detect outflows of gas, heavy in metals, flowing in wide swaths out of galaxies. This is because gas in the universe is not unadulterated hydrogen but is spiced sparingly with heavier elements, manufactured primarily when stars explode at the end of their lives. While there is still significant debate about what could be driving outflows in galaxies, the two most widely discussed theories, supernova explosions or the fast streams of gas spurted from the central supermassive black hole, were both scouted by Bill, and ample evidence now endures for both scenarios.</p>
<p>Most of the space between galaxies in clusters is also filled with gas, yet this gas is incredibly hot. This shocked gas is heated to about ten million kelvin and cannot cool efficiently because it is too tenuous and, as such, is predicted to endure, rather than condense into stars and galaxies. Yet, as Bill never tired of pointing out, one of the enduring mysteries about galaxy clusters is that the hot intracluster gas should cool faster than is observed. &#8220;These inadequacies suggest that a new physical mechanism, in addition to the basic jet hydrodynamics, should play a critical role,&#8221; he wrote (with Fulai Guo) in an article in 2012. Bill suggested that hot gas also might be turbulent, maybe driven by mechanical gas outflows expelled from the supermassive black holes at the centers of the clusters' galaxies, possibly inflating bubbles of high-speed charged particles that shake and warm the intracluster gas. Bill&#8217;s seminal work on the subject, though not definitive, implies that no mysterious processes needed to be invoked to explain the persistent hot gas.</p>
<p>Gas enriched with metals is ubiquitous and can be found everywhere in the Universe, both in between galaxies and within them, ripe to be recycled into new stars. Freshly synthesized stars amalgamate from gas loaded with heavy metals together with dust. Surrounding stars, protoplanetary disks are formed, which now and then consolidate into planets, like the one we inhabit. The all-pervading dust, a subject at the center of Bill&#8217;s pioneering interests, not only renders life more enjoyable by giving us sunset tints but appears to be wholly indispensable for our existence. The overwhelming relevance of the little stuff in our world has been brought home to us through Bill's extraordinary investigations into the widespread and far-reaching beneficial influences of gas, metals, and dust in the universe.</p>
<p>Bill's passion for life and for science, his fervor, his honesty, his brilliance, his dedication, his relentless resolution, his high expectations for the pursuit of knowledge, his love of family and community, and his wonderful attentiveness for fun, were the trademarks of his life. He was an inspiration, and he became a mentor and a friend. I am eternally grateful that my path crossed his.</p>

He was 67.</p>
<p>Tyler stepped down as humanities dean in June 2020, formally retiring from UC Santa Cruz to accept the position of dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Fordham University in New York. He was serving in that role at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Tyler&#8217;s contributions to our campus were many. He began his tenure as Humanities dean here in Santa Cruz in 2014, coming to us from UC Berkeley, where he was a professor of history and dean of the undergraduate division of the College of Letters and Science. Tyler&#8217;s arrival in 2014 was a return, though, not a beginning. He had previously spent 13 years as a faculty member in our History Department, and had also served as provost of Stevenson College. An insightful scholar and author dedicated to social justice and the advancement of minority scholars, Tyler touched the lives of countless students, faculty and staff in his nearly two decades on our campus. We knew Tyler as a skilled educator and as a thoughtful, generous, and kind colleague. He will be missed tremendously.</p>
<p>Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Stovall earned his B.A. in history from Harvard University and an M.A in European history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he went on to receive a Ph.D. in Modern European/French History with a minor in Latin American Studies.</p>
<p>In addition to his time on our campus and at Fordham, Tyler taught at The Ohio State University and worked as a visiting professor at the Universit&#233; de Polyn&#233;sie Fran&#231;aise in Tahiti. He was also a past president of the American Historical Association, the oldest society of historians and history professors in the United States.</p>
<p>He authored several books and numerous articles in the field of modern French history, specializing in transnational history, labor, colonialism, and race. His books include <em>Black France &#8260; France Noire: The History and Politics of Blackness</em> , <em>Paris and the Spirit of 1919: Consumer Struggles, Transnationalism, and Revolution</em> , <em>Universal Nation: A Transnational History of Modern France</em> , and <em>White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea</em> , published at the start of this year.</p>
<p>On our campus, Tyler was a strong advocate for the Black Studies minor and for establishment of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies as a department. He was also a strong supporter of The Humanities Institute (THI), and it developed greatly during his tenure as dean. THI continues to serve as a model for advancing student and faculty research and for creating unique events that engage the broader community in questions that matter to us all.</p>
<p>We offer our deepest condolences to Tyler&#8217;s wife, Denise Herd; their son, Justin; and the many in our campus community who counted Tyler as a close colleague and friend. We are grateful for his lasting contributions to our university.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca66c15f807270462612537c77c8adb7"><name>2021-accomplishments</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The importance of vaccine boosters, recognizing our 2021 accomplishments</title><summary>The end of a calendar year naturally spurs reflection.

You reveal your compassion for others by following public health guidance and observing our campus COVID protocols. By doing so, you have kept campus COVID rates extremely low during this pandemic, and for that I am forever grateful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pandemic is not over. The new Omicron variant appears especially vexing, and new variants are likely to emerge in the coming months. In response, I urge all eligible members of our campus community to get a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as local, state and federal health officials. If at all possible, please get your booster before returning to campus for the start of Winter Quarter classes. Boosters are not a fail-safe preventive, but along with masking they are our best line of defense.

<p>The end of a calendar year naturally spurs reflection. It&#8217;s a time to think back on both the challenges we&#8217;ve faced individually and collectively, and to celebrate our accomplishments. There have been many.</p>
<p>Naming College Ten in honor of civil rights leader John R. Lewis was a momentous day for both the college and for our campus as a whole, one that we will continue to celebrate as the calendar flips to 2022, when the formal naming takes place. The announcement highlighted our work as a national leader in the social justice and equity movement, and having Representative Lewis&#8217; name attached to our campus gives us further inspiration and responsibility to follow his legacy.</p>
<p>We launched our Student Success Initiative, doubling down on our commitment to be a truly student-serving institution with an extraordinary research profile and impact. We will continue to do all in our power to ensure that students have full access to the wide range of opportunities our incredible university provides. I&#8217;m excited to watch this initiative unfold.</p>
<p>It was wonderful earlier this fall to see Regents overwhelmingly endorse our vision for the main campus and the Westside Research Park, unanimously approving our 2021 Long Range Development Plan. This plan will guide us through the next two decades, providing us a framework to support students well into the future. The approval capped four years of work by campus planners and leaders, and involved gathering input from hundreds in our campus community and beyond. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to ensure the plan is implemented smartly, reducing community impacts, showing us to be a good neighbor.</p>
<p>Giving Day 2021 proved to be a huge success, with 3,000-plus donors kicking in more than $700,000, our most successful Giving Day ever. In difficult economic times, seeing our community of friends and supporters step up to support our students so generously is incredibly gratifying.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months we have welcomed to UCSC three incredibly smart, talented and inspirational deans, with Jasmine Alinder (Humanities), Peter Biehl (Graduate Studies), and Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu (Arts) joining an already strong cohort of academic leaders. We are doing <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/year-in-review/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639862782432000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Wm9QqRNw7Dr2mju2yHX1-" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/year-in-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">great things campuswide</a> &#8212; purpose-driven work that advances justice, pushes the envelope of knowledge, and advocates for transformative change &#8212; and we are poised to accomplish even more in the year ahead.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to reaffirm our shared commitment to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. Earlier this year we launched our new <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/uc-lift.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639862782432000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FAEysnHX7PbSQIEoH585z" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/uc-lift.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Latinx Initiative for Future Teachers</a> program. LIFT enables students to earn a master&#8217;s in education and earn credentials for teaching in math, science, history or English in just 12 months and receive mentorship and financial support. The goal is for graduates to become leading advocates for equity, social justice and antiracism in the schools where they land. We have more work to do in this area, and we are committed to doing it.</p>
<p>As we approach the end of a year that has demanded much of all of us all, I feel incredibly proud of all we have accomplished together and I offer my thanks and gratitude to all in our community who have helped to push our university to greater heights. Enjoy the winter break, and I look forward to reconnecting in the new year!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="deccd035807270462612537cd09936cd"><name>winter-quarter-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on winter quarter</title><summary>With the rapid rise nationwide in the number of COVID-19 infections caused by the Omicron variant and the likelihood that holiday gatherings will only further increase infections, UC campuses are implementing additional mitigations.</summary><start-date>1640073600000</start-date><display-name>Update on winter quarter</display-name><path>/2021/12/winter-quarter-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/winter-quarter-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1640120504346</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1642525759375</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the rapid rise nationwide in the number of COVID-19 infections caused by the Omicron variant and the likelihood that holiday gatherings will only further increase infections, UC campuses are implementing additional mitigations. UC Santa Cruz is planning to begin the first two weeks of winter quarter (Jan. 3-14) with alternative and remote modes of instruction instead of scheduled in-person instructional meetings. We also recommend faculty and staff hold meetings and events remotely during the first two weeks of the quarter. Other campus operations will continue as scheduled. Students are encouraged to return to campus on schedule.</p>
<p>We do not take this step lightly, and do so after consultation with academic and administrative leaders and campus health-center staff. Supporting the health and well-being of our campus community remains a high priority, and we want to make sure that our extensive testing strategy, which was extremely effective as we started fall quarter 2021, lays a solid foundation for our winter quarter.</p>
<p>This shift in instructional delivery will give us two weeks to identify COVID-19 cases and take appropriate measures to mitigate further spread through our campus community. We will be sharing more information with instructors about how they might plan for the first two weeks of instruction, given that a universal shift to Zoom may not be possible with students in residence. Instructors will receive an email containing guidance on how to approach preparing for instruction later today. <a href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/">Keep Teaching</a> is also being updated.</p>
<p>We plan that all classes scheduled to be in-person in winter quarter will resume fully in-person instruction on Jan.18. We will closely monitor the public health environment and the guidance and information provided by local public health authorities and adjust our plans as appropriate.</p>
<p>There are two important steps we all should take prior to returning for winter quarter: getting a booster shot (if eligible) and getting tested prior to returning to campus.</p>
<h1>Get a booster shot</h1>
<p>Everything we have learned so far about the Omicron variant underscores the importance of being fully vaccinated and getting a booster. Under <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19">existing UC policy</a> , students, faculty, and staff are required to keep their vaccination status up to date. The policy strongly encourages COVID-19 boosters for those who are eligible.</p>
<p>You are eligible for a booster if it&#8217;s been at least two months since receiving the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine or six months since your second Moderna or Pfizer dose. Booster shots and COVID-19 vaccines are available broadly through retail pharmacies. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html?s_cid=11705:who%20can%20get%20the%20covid%20booster:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22">Information on booster eligibility is available from the Centers for Disease Control here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx">Santa Cruz County Health website</a> provides information about scheduling a vaccine or a booster. California&#8217;s <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">MyTurn website</a> is another great resource, and additional resources may be available for community members currently in other states and countries.</p>
<h1>Test prior to returning</h1>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://ucop.edu/uc-health/_files/fall-2021-covid-19-prevention-strategies-july.pdf">UC Health Coordinating Committee&#8217;s guidance</a> for returning students, the campus will follow a test, sequester, and retest model as we return from winter break. We expect that all students will get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test prior to returning to campus for winter quarter, and we encourage employees to do the same. Do not return to campus if you test positive, and only return to campus once you have tested negative.</p>
<p>In addition to a pre-arrival test, students must get tested on campus at their first opportunity to do so. Regardless of vaccination status, students will have deadlines for testing and more information about scheduling a campus test will be sent out soon.</p>
<p>We are also making it easier for campus COVID-19 testing when you return by enhancing services from Fulgent Genetics. Fulgent will be taking over testing at both campus locations, the Merrill Cultural Center and Express Store, in January 2022 and asymptomatic testing appointments will no longer be available through Health e-Messenger. You will receive a registration email from Fulgent for COVID-19 testing. To avoid long lines, please visit the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html">student COVID-19 webpage </a> or the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-staff.html">employee COVID-19 webpage</a> to get a link to the Fulgent scheduler.</p>
<p>Students who are still in the area can pick up an at-home COVID testing kit on campus before supplies run out. The kits are being provided on a first-come, first-serve basis and may be picked up at the Bay Tree Bookstore before it closes for Winter Break at <strong>4 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 22. Please note that we can only provide one kit per individual, and it is intended for use right before you return to campus.</strong></p>
<p>Employees in the area may pick up a COVID testing kit until <strong>3 p.m. Dec. 22</strong> at the Scotts Valley Center or Silicon Valley reception desks (Scotts Valley is closed between 12-1 p.m. for lunch) or the Bay Tree Bookstore. <strong>Please note that we can only provide one kit per employee, and it is intended for use right before you return to campus.</strong> We cannot offer test kits to employees who are currently working 100 percent remote.</p>
<p>If you are a student or employee and did not obtain a test kit before departing campus, please obtain a self-test kit at your local drug store or pharmacy or have a test administered for you. If you cannot obtain a self-test kit, please complete this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XweIKWyIxWcexqRuxt-M9XiG5FMxqUrFw-5BNh0xwXg/edit">online form</a> no later than **noon Friday, Dec. 24,**and a test kit will be mailed to you.</p>
<p>To our instructional and academic staff, we appreciate your flexibility in making this adjustment for the start of winter quarter. Information will be forthcoming very soon to support your preparation for this change.

Recognized for her versatility, confidence, and wit, Walker is a firebrand who in the 90s led the way for women to land lead roles on prime-time TV. She has enjoyed sustained success in Hollywood, though her story includes many unpredictable moments and an opening scene set in a biology lab overlooking the Pacific Ocean.<br/> <br/>Having grown up primarily in New Mexico, Walker was allured by the beauty, ocean, and natural canvas that envelop the UC Santa Cruz campus. She was also attracted to the science program, where she flexed her academic agility in pursuit of a degree in biology. <br/> <br/>&#8220;UCSC really opened up ways of thinking about things and living that I hadn&#8217;t experienced before, because I came from a traditional family life,&#8221; Walker says. &#8220;It was a cultural shift that really opened my eyes to a lot of possibilities.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Walker&#8217;s parents instilled in her the value of education, and she is paying that forward in the form of a significant gift to the <a href="https://renaissancescholars.ucsc.edu/index.html">Renaissance Scholars Program</a>. The funds support academic advising and counseling, financial assistance, and other forms of support for promising UC Santa Cruz students who have had to navigate unimaginable obstacles to earn a college education. The program assists students who have been homeless, are current or former foster youth, or who have experienced the incarceration of themselves or close relatives.<br/> <br/>A mother of three boys, her natural love of children was publicly and compassionately displayed in her 2005 award-winning documentary <em>For Norman: Wherever You Are</em>, which revealed flaws in the Los Angeles County foster care system. The film, which she directed, resulted in positive changes in the program and earned her &#8220;Best Documentary Feature&#8221; at the San Fernando International Film Festival and the Champion of Conscience Award at the Wine Country Film Festival.</p>
<h3>From the laboratory to the big screen</h3>
<p>Walker was raised by parents who embraced the arts, limited television, and encouraged reading. While she excelled at science, she had a burgeoning talent for writing, which she says sprouted out of youthful boredom. Her imagination would wander, and she would journal, write poetry, and develop short stories that took her beyond the margins of the scientific world into the land of make believe.<br/> <br/>Upon graduating from UC Santa Cruz, she landed a job at a genetic engineering company. It didn&#8217;t take long for her to realize that sequencing DNA in a laboratory was not the best fit. <br/> <br/>&#8220;I knew right away that this path was not for me,&#8221; Walker says. &#8220;The lab was too confining. So, I sold everything I owned and went to Australia for a while. I traveled, surfed, and worked odd jobs.&#8221; <br/> <br/>One of those jobs was waiting tables. One day she spilled a pot of coffee on a talent agent who was in the modeling business, and rather than admonishing the 5&#8217; 10&#8221; waitress, he suggested that she consider modeling. <br/> <br/>She leaned into the meet with her signature easy-going spirit and participated in a photoshoot&#8212;with her then-actor boyfriend behind the camera&#8212;and with little conviction that it would lead to anything. She returned to Los Angeles with a new plan to continue her science trajectory by going to medical school. Meanwhile, her boyfriend shared the photos with top Los Angeles model agency executives, Nina Blanchard and Eileen Ford, who signed her and secured Walker roles in commercials. In 1989, she was Clairol&#8217;s &#8220;Nice &amp; Easy Girl.&#8221;<br/> <br/>One evening while she was having dinner with a friend, another serendipitous moment set her on a course that changed her life. She was approached by a movie director who noticed her playful laugh and charismatic personality. He asked her if she&#8217;d like to read for a small part in a film he was directing. The next day she was hired, and while most of her scene was cut, this small part would be the beginning of a successful career in Hollywood. <br/> <br/>&#8220;Being on that set and watching people work, just being part of something and not being isolated in a laboratory was amazing. I was like, &#8216;I would love to do this.&#8217;&#8221;<br/> <br/>Her first big break was a regular role on the soap opera, <em>Santa Barbara</em>. This led to more opportunities including landing the lead role as a forensic psychologist in <em>Profiler</em> in 1996. She was one of very few female leads in a television series at the time, and the show set the stage for future crime series like <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> and <em>Law &amp; Order Special Victims Unit</em>, paving the way for women to secure leading opportunities in Hollywood. <br/> <br/>With more than 25 movie credits and an extensive list of roles and guest appearances on television series, Walker has demonstrated her range of talents by writing, directing, and producing several movies, as well as authoring multiple books, including her current project, a novel that combines science with people and humanity.<br/> <br/>Walker understands the importance of being true to one&#8217;s values, gifts, and talents. A strong woman on and off screen, she has stayed grounded in her principles while remaining open to letting her instincts and fate guide her to and through a prosperous career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life will sort of present to you where you are meant to be,&#8221; Walker says. &#8220;Trust yourself. Do what you love. Stay at it if you love it, and that will be your success.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e4980bff807270462612537c9de76a9d"><name>social-distancing-economics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Impacts of rainy weather on coronavirus outbreaks reveal economic benefits from earlier social distancing</title><summary>Economists at UC Santa Cruz used rainy weather as a natural experiment to understand how communities across the U.S. that started some form of social distancing slightly earlier may have experienced significant economic benefits. &#13;

Quite a lot, as it turns out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before the first wave of stay-at-home orders were issued, rainy weather prompted behaviors similar to early social distancing in some counties across the U.S., and health data indicate that these behavior changes likely saved lives. Economists at UC Santa Cruz have studied the effects of this stroke of luck as part of a natural experiment. Their findings show how communities that started some form of social distancing slightly earlier may have experienced significant economic benefits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new research, published in the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001600?via%3Dihub"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Health Economics</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggests that a 1% decrease in the population leaving home due to rain on the weekend before lockdown likely slowed spread of the virus enough to create an average of up to $132 dollars of benefit per county resident within two weeks, resulting from avoided COVID-19 deaths. Based on these findings, and the results of prior studies, the paper&#8217;s authors estimate that starting initial pandemic lockdowns two days earlier could have generated as much as $198 to $264 of benefit per person within two weeks, compared to an estimated average cost of $2 to $14 per person in additional lost wages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When it comes to implementing lockdowns, I think this shows that having faster decision-making processes really pays off compared to a more wait-and-see approach,&#8221; said Associate Professor of Economics Ajay Shenoy, lead author of the new paper.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the public health basis for this argument has long been clear, the paper&#8217;s findings make an economic case for the merits of quicker action that allows for more direct comparison with some of the economic costs that have driven political debate around stay-at-home orders. And the paper&#8217;s focus on rain-induced social distancing also provides a unique opportunity to isolate the impacts of social distancing from other related variables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenoy explained that many of the communities in the U.S. that were quickest to implement stay-at-home orders shared common demographic characteristics or similarities in political climate and public health resources. Those factors could impact pandemic outcomes independently, which makes it difficult to hone in on the specific effect of social distancing alone. But rainy weather provided an outside influence that compelled people to stay home across a relatively random sampling of different types of communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn't rain more on a county because it has better hospitals, and the rain doesn&#8217;t care whether you're rich or poor,&#8221; Shenoy said, &#8220;it just sort of happens randomly&#8212;at least after you control for historical weather patterns. So nature handed us a scenario that was pretty well able to simulate a randomized experiment on the impacts of social distancing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenoy says another benefit of natural experiments is that they can prove useful for ground-truthing the predictions of epidemiological models. Ultimately, he hopes the current paper&#8217;s findings may help to inform public health policy. An analysis within the paper suggests that earlier social distancing at the outset of the pandemic produced economic benefits on average primarily because it lowers the chance of very serious outbreaks in a small number of communities. Shenoy says this illustrates a major political challenge for stay-at-home orders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for leaders in a county to point to a concrete benefit of their policies, because what they&#8217;ve averted is a small chance of a very bad outcome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The county next door may get lucky and avoid that outcome too, even if they didn&#8217;t lock down earlier. So you really need to have a very large comparison group to be able to actually detect these types of benefits.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team believes their findings may offer a form of large-scale validation for the economic merits of quicker social distancing implementation. In fact, the authors argue that the paper&#8217;s projected benefits are likely an underestimate, since they focused only on the economic value of lives saved, rather than other potential benefits like reduced health care costs and reduced incidence of chronic illness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future research could sharpen the picture by incorporating these additional types of benefits and comparing them alongside other potential costs, like lost business profit, lost schooling time for children, or mental health impacts. More work will also be needed to assess how vaccines, treatments, and more infectious variants may have affected cost-benefit calculations since the first wave of the pandemic.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Shenoy points out that a significant mechanism affecting these calculations is that the costs of earlier social distancing are generally relatively fixed, while the benefits are more likely to continue accruing over time. He hopes that greater understanding of these economic payoffs could bring new perspective to discussions around public health policies.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In our analysis, the economic benefits overall are really quite large relative to the costs, and the reason for that is somewhat intuitive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it comes to slowing the spread of something like the coronavirus, taking steps early to cut off a transmission chain is an investment in public health that's going to pay exponential returns.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fe5975df807270462612537cb76b7378"><name>return-to-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Instructions for students returning to campus</title><summary>We realize that the pandemic has been unpredictable, and public health guidelines often change, so we are reaching out to provide you with the most up-to-date information for your return from Winter Break.</summary><start-date>1640592000000</start-date><display-name>Return to Campus, January 2022</display-name><path>/2021/12/return-to-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/12/return-to-campus</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1640649815490</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581500097</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, we must continue our mitigation efforts of getting fully vaccinated (including booster shots when eligible), wearing face coverings indoors, frequent handwashing, and participating in the campus testing program.

<h2>Test 48 Hours Before Returning to Campus</h2>
<p>All students are required to get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test <em>before</em> returning to campus for the winter quarter. If your test is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you.</p>
<h2>Register for On-Site Campus Testing</h2>
<p>Fulgent Genetics has taken over testing at both campus locations: the Merrill Cultural Center and Express Store. You should have received a registration email from Fulgent for COVID-19 testing. If you missed your registration deadline, you will receive another email prompting you to register.</p>
<p>Please note that asymptomatic testing appointments will no longer be available through Health-e Messenger. To avoid long lines, please visit the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html">student COVID-19 webpage</a> to learn more about testing requirements and <a href="https://backtoschool.fulgentgenetics.com/ucsantacruz/residence_appointment/screen/landing">schedule future appointments.</a> The Fulgent appointment scheduler will be activated on Jan. 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Lastly, <em>if you are a new arrival to our campus,</em> you will need to log-in to <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html">Health E-Messenger</a> to become compliant with the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html">UC COVID Vaccine Policy</a>. The deadline was ****Monday, Dec. 13, 2021. <strong>If you missed this deadline to provide proof of vaccination status or request an exemption, it is important to comply as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<h2>Instructions for Arrival on Campus</h2>
<h4>All Residential Students (Living On-Campus)</h4>
<p><strong>Regardless of vaccination status, all residential students must test at an on-campus testing site within 48 hours of their arrival.</strong> This post-arrival, on-campus test is in addition to your pre-arrival test. Students living on-campus who delay their return beyond the first days of instruction are encouraged to return to campus on the weekend of Jan. 8-9, 2022. Students who further delay their return to campus should plan to arrive back on campus no later than Jan. 13, 2022, to complete the post-arrival, on-site testing requirement.</p>
<h4>Not Fully Vaccinated Students (Living On-Campus)</h4>
<p>Once your initial post-arrival, on-campus test is completed, <em>not fully vaccinated students who live on campus</em> will resume the required testing cadence of at least once every 4 days.</p>
<p>Students who are not fully vaccinated <strong>are also required to sequester for a 7-day period</strong>, during which every effort should be made to limit movement around the campus and in-person interactions. Students can still attend essential activities, such as going to class, work, and picking up food to-go during their sequestration period.</p>
<h4>Fully Vaccinated Students (Living On-Campus)</h4>
<p>Once your initial post-arrival, on-campus test is completed, <em>fully vaccinated students who live on campus</em> <strong>must take a Rapid Antigen test 2-3 days later and then complete a PCR test on-campus every two weeks after their initial test date.</strong> The Rapid Antigen test will be provided during your post-arrival, on-campus test.</p>
<p><em>Fully vaccinated students</em> are <strong>also required to sequester until they receive a negative initial post-arrival, on-site test result or are cleared by the Student Health Center</strong>. During the sequester period, every effort should be made to limit movement around the campus and in-person interactions. Fully vaccinated students can still attend essential activities, such as going to class, work, and eating in the dining hall during their sequestration period.</p>
<h4>Non-Residential Students (Living Off-Campus)</h4>
<p><strong>Regardless of vaccination status, all students living off-campus must test at an on-campus testing site within 48 hours of starting in-person classes or any activities on campus.</strong> This post-arrival, on-campus test is in addition to your pre-arrival test.</p>
<h4>Not Fully Vaccinated Students (Living Off-Campus)</h4>
<p>Once your initial post-arrival, on-campus test is completed, <em>not fully vaccinated off-campus students</em> will resume your testing cadence of at least once every 4 days as required. If you are traveling over the Winter Break, please take a Rapid Antigen test or PCR test 2-3 days before returning to Santa Cruz. If your test is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you.</p>
<p><em>Please Note:</em> The four-day testing requirement does not apply to employees who have completed a COVID-19 vaccine series but are not yet eligible for their booster or who plan to receive the booster by Jan. 31, 2022.</p>
<h4>Fully Vaccinated Students (Living Off-Campus)</h4>
<p>Once your initial post-arrival, on-campus test is completed, <em>fully vaccinated off-campus students</em> have the option of taking a Rapid Antigen or Fulgent PCR test, if desired. If you are traveling over the winter break, please take a Rapid Antigen or PCR test 2-3 days before returning to Santa Cruz. If your test is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html">Testing Protocols webpage</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Statewide Mask Mandate</h2>
<p>A reminder that face coverings are a requirement indoors on the UC Santa Cruz campus, and the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/">California Department of Public Health</a> requires them indoors across the state. This order is in effect until at least Jan. 15, 2022. Wearing a face covering is one of the best ways to protect yourself and other members of our community.</p>
<h2>Booster Deadline: Jan. 31, 2022</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus#dec-21">UC system COVID-19 vaccination policy</a> requires faculty, staff, and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. You can qualify for a booster if it has been at least 2 months since you received the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine or 6 months after your second Moderna or Pfizer dose. Eligible students should get their booster before the start of instruction. <strong>UCSC&#8217;s deadline for compliance with the booster requirement is Jan. 31, 2022.</strong> Students who are not yet eligible must comply with the booster requirement within 2 weeks of eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>The Student Health Center will be hosting booster shot clinics on Jan. 19, 20, and 21, 2022, at the Hay Barn.</strong> You can also find a location providing them in your area on the <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx">Santa Cruz County Health website</a> or California&#8217;s <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">MyTurn website</a>.</p>
