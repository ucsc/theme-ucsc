<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, five high-profile UC Santa Cruz alumni are using their talents to boost a philanthropic social justice initiative called Rise Together, a movement that harnesses the passions and talents of 17 leaders of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Foundation Santa Cruz County convened this group last year to support the vision and action needed to build a more just and equitable county. Rise Together recently made $423,000 in&#160; grants to support work on racial equity initiatives in Santa Cruz County and is currently fundraising to support future grants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Building awareness and trust</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan True (Oakes '95, community studies), CEO of Community Foundation Santa Cruz County, spoke about the need for an initiative that builds awareness and trust in communities of color, addresses the root causes of racism, and invests in programs that support them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rise Together hopes to increase economic mobility and preserve stories, arts, and culture for communities of color,&#8221; True said. &#8220;While the Community Foundation&#8217;s grantmaking has worked to address inequities for decades, I knew we needed to do more.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t accelerate solutions if the people most harmed by our county&#8217;s most pressing problems are not trusted and welcomed to create the answers,&#8221; True continued. &#8220;The people most affected by injustice need to be the ones driving the solutions that will work best for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rise Together has a unique, shared leadership model. Its circle of leaders work closely together to set goals and priorities for funding allocations. Many of its leaders are also beneficiaries of Rise Together grants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s what makes this work so unusual in the philanthropic sector,&#8221; True said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community Foundation pairs donors with local projects that exemplify their values. &#8220;Funding decisions are being made by the grantees themselves."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of UCSC alumni participants reads like a "who&#8217;s who" guide to well-known activists and socially conscious leaders affiliated with the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from True, those alumni are:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Cummings (Ph.D. '13, ecology and evolutionary biology), former Santa Cruz mayor and current city council member.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacob Martinez (Oakes '04, evolutionary biology), founder of Digital NEST, a technology workforce development hub providing youth in rural communities with valuable technology skills.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby Vasquez (Merrill '87, A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">merican studies/Chicano studies and Multiple Subject/Bilingual Credential)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an educator in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District, a traditional dance instructor for the Mexican folkloric dance group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estrellas de Esperanza for children and youth and assistant director for Esperanza del Valle, a dance company for adults, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd organizer for the Watsonville Campesino Appreciation Caravan.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helen Aldana (Kresge '13, art and philosophy), outreach and inclusion manager for the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz; also board president for Senderos.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashyln Adams ('0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9, film and literature), chair of the California Film And Cultural Center.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A circle of justice</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz community is full of imaginative, ambitious, and socially conscious people who are seeking funds for their projects, but leaders often find themselves hampered by bureaucracies and paperwork, Ruby Vasquez said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez&#8217;s nonprofits are truly grassroots organizations, with no paid staff and, thus, no grant writers. Vasquez pointed out that grant applications have been a huge barrier for small, volunteer-led nonprofits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Applying for grants can be such a headache,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;It takes a lot of work. There are organizations with grant writers and people who dedicate their time to that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Vasquez applied for a Rise Together grant to help bring an esteemed traditional dance instructor from the Costa Chica Region of Oaxaca, Mexico, to work with her student folk dance group in Watsonville.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found that the process was straightforward, unintimidating, local, and personal. Vasquez did not have to mail off application forms to staff members of philanthropic organizations she will never meet. Instead, the process was intimate and participatory every step of the way. Instead of meeting with grant writers, the Rise Together group made presentations to each other about the funding they needed for their projects. Then the group made collective decisions about each proposal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez was thrilled when Rise Together decided to fund her project. The dance instructor will teach her students the &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Danza de los Diablos" - the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dance of the devils&#8212; and&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sones de Artesa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which are part of the Afro-Mexican tradition of Oaxaca. Vasquez hopes the students will learn this intricate dance in time for Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican Day of the Dead, which will be November 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This dance class is a great way to celebrate the African lineage in Mexican heritage, while preserving and publicizing traditional dance,&#8221; Vasquez said. &#8220;I am really proud to be able to expose our students to this because it shows there are strong cross-cultural connections, even within our own ethnic group.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez will use the Rise Together funds to cover the instructor&#8217;s travel expenses, lodging, and meals, as well as a stipend for his teaching.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez, who comes from a family of strawberry growers, also received funds for the Watsonville Campesino Appreciation Caravan (WCAC), a volunteer initiative that honors California&#8217;s essential farmworkers, with drivers stopping their cars and waving "thank you" placards. The appreciation caravan has also handed out food as well as information on medical resources and staying safe during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since April, WCAC has been visiting one or two agricultural work sites per week offering a burrito lunch during a half-hour presentation about COVID safety and&#160; information from local community&#160; resources. Rise Together funds allow the purchase of lunch and the distribution of gift cards.</span></p>
<p><strong>Removing bureaucracy, increasing impacts</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By making the grant application process less forbidding and putting fundraising initiatives into local hands, members of the Rise Together circle are addressing the institutional racial bias in philanthropy, said Jacob Martinez, referring to research from the </span><a href="http://racialequity.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which found that only 8% of philanthropy goes to organizations led by people of color.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Resources don&#8217;t trickle down to programs led by people of color,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;Historically, in this county, philanthropic organizations have underinvested in communities of color. Look at Watsonville, and at the Beach Flats community in Santa Cruz. They need a lot of support, and their community programs are the most impacted by cost-of-living changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we support those programs so they are not pushed out? How do we support jobs, housing, mental health, and education?" he continued. "Rise Together focuses on bringing in new leaders and working with the Community Foundation, and asking, &#8216;How do we change the narrative?&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>

<p>In September, UC Santa Cruz professor and medical anthropologist Nancy Chen was featured in a TED Salon talk called &#8220;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_n_chen_the_inaccurate_link_between_body_ideals_and_health?utm_source=tedcomshare&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tedspread#t-22070">The inaccurate link between body ideals and health</a>,&#8221; that has since been viewed more than 780,000 times online.</p>
<p>TED producers approached Chen for her research expertise at the intersection of food and health. In her roughly nine minute talk, Chen focuses first on how ideals related to weight and body shape have varied across cultures and time. But, she notes, Western societies have more recently popularized depictions of models with very thin body types, and these ideals have since spread to many places around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Weight stigma or fat phobia and bias are increasingly found not only in the global north but also the global south,&#8221; Chen says in her talk.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, obesity rates have increased globally. Chen argues that public health campaigns intended to address health issues associated with obesity must be careful to avoid reinforcing weight stigmas, otherwise, they are likely to backfire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we are concerned about health and wellbeing, then we need to go beyond body standards or ideals,&#8221; she explained in the video. &#8220;We need to consider how healthy bodies are based on what&#8217;s going on inside, rather than focusing on externalities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen also discussed how the body diversity movement has been challenging harmful ideals and promoting representation for a wide variety of body shapes and features as part of social diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on the popularity of her talk since its release, Chen said there&#8217;s clear public interest in approaches to health and image that do more to promote esteem and self-care.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the issues raised in the talk resonated with ongoing concerns for wellbeing and healing as we all move forward,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We can be better together if we focus on vitality.&#8221;&#160; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4bd0a0b8807270466cc00b00abb659b9"><name>annual-safety-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report</title><summary>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is committed to assisting all members of the community in providing for their safety and security.</summary><start-date>1633071600000</start-date><display-name>Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report</display-name><path>/2021/10/annual-safety-report</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/annual-safety-report</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1633359536288</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633359536288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is committed to assisting all members of the community in providing for their safety and security.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The Clery Act&#8212;named by Congress in honor of 19-year-old Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University student who was raped and killed in her dorm room&#8212;requires colleges and universities to disclose their security policies, keep a public crime log, publish an annual crime report, and provide timely warnings to students and campus employees about a crime posing an immediate or ongoing threat to students and campus employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures, and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. It also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by UC Santa Cruz; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. It also contains information about fire safety, including fire safety policies and fire statistics for each on campus student housing facility.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Fire Safety</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The deadly wildfires throughout California, and especially the 2020 CZU Complex Fire in Santa Cruz County, serves as a reminder that we all need to do our part to prevent wildfires. The impacts of the CZU Complex Fire were so severe that the campus was forced to evacuate staff, faculty and students for the first time in the campus's 55 year history. Fortunately, the fire never reached the campus and occupancy was quickly restored. Anyone who smells smoke or sees a fire must not hesitate to dial 911.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Section 4421 of the Public Resources Code states that no person shall set fire or cause fire to be set to any forest, brush, or other flammable material which is on any land that is not his/her own, or under his/her legal control, without the permission of the owner, lessee, or agent of the owner or lessee of the land.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Information about registered sex offenders</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, institutions of higher education must annually provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff's department.

(Image credit: Andy LiWang)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The reconstituted biological clock maintains daily cycles for days on end, allowing researchers to study the interactions of its component parts</article-subhead><article-text><p>Daily cycles in virtually every aspect of our physiology are driven by biological clocks (also called circadian clocks) in our cells. The cyclical interactions of clock proteins keep the biological rhythms of life in tune with the daily cycle of night and day, and this happens not only in humans and other complex animals but even in simple, single-celled organisms such as cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>A team of scientists has now reconstituted the circadian clock of cyanobacteria in a test tube, enabling them to study rhythmic interactions of the clock proteins in real time and understand how these interactions enable the clock to exert control over gene expression. Researchers in three labs at UC Santa Cruz, UC Merced, and UC San Diego collaborated on the study, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd4453">published October 8 in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reconstituting a complicated biological process like the circadian clock from the ground up has really helped us learn how the clock proteins work together and will enable a much deeper understanding of circadian rhythms,&#8221; said Carrie Partch, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the study.</p>
<p>Partch noted that the molecular details of circadian clocks are remarkably similar from cyanobacteria to humans. Having a functioning clock that can be studied in the test tube (&#8220;in vitro&#8221;) instead of in living cells (&#8220;in vivo&#8221;) provides a powerful platform for exploring the clock&#8217;s mechanisms and how it responds to changes. The team conducted experiments in living cells to confirm that their in vitro results are consistent with the way the clock operates in live cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results were so surprising because it is common to have results in vitro that are somewhat inconsistent with what is observed in vivo. The interior of live cells is highly complex, in stark contrast to the much simpler conditions in vitro,&#8221; said Andy LiWang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Merced and a corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>The new study builds on previous work by Japanese researchers, who in 2005 reconstituted the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, the basic 24-hour timekeeping loop of the clock. The oscillator consists of three related proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. In living cells, signals from the oscillator are transmitted through other proteins to control the expression of genes in a circadian cycle.</p>
<p>The new in vitro clock includes, in addition to the oscillator proteins, two kinase proteins (SasA and CikA), whose activities are modified by interacting with the oscillator, as well as a DNA-binding protein (RpaA) and its DNA target.</p>
<p>&#8220;SasA and CikA respectively activate and deactivate RpaA such that it rhythmically binds and unbinds DNA,&#8221; LiWang explained. &#8220;In cyanobacteria, this rhythmic binding and unbinding at over 100 different sites in their genome activates and deactivates the expression of numerous genes important to health and survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using fluorescent labeling techniques, the researchers were able to track the interactions between all of these clock components as the whole system oscillates with a circadian rhythm for many days and even weeks. This system enabled the team to determine how SasA and CikA enhance the robustness of the oscillator, keeping it ticking under conditions in which the KaiABC proteins by themselves would stop oscillating.</p>
<p>The researchers also used the in vitro system to explore the genetic origins of clock disruption in an arrhythmic strain of cyanobacteria. They identified a single mutation in the gene for RpaA that reduces the protein&#8217;s DNA-binding efficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;A single amino acid change in the transcription factor makes the cell lose the rhythm of gene expression, even though its clock is intact,&#8221; said coauthor Susan Golden, director of the Center for Circadian Biology at UC San Diego, of which Partch and LiWang are also members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real beauty of this project is how the team drawn from three UC campuses came together to pool approaches toward answering how a cell can tell time,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The active collaboration extended well beyond the principal investigators, with the students and postdocs who were trained in different disciplines conferring among themselves to share genetics, structural biology, and biophysical data, explaining to one another the significance of their findings. The cross-discipline communication was as important to the success of the project as the impressive skills of the researchers.&#8221;</p>

Mellon Foundation has awarded a $1,977,000 grant to support <em>Visualizing Abolition</em>, the nation&#8217;s most ambitious and sustained art and prison abolition initiative, led by UC Santa Cruz Feminist Studies Associate Professor Gina Dent, and Rachel Nelson, Director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The funding provides three years of support for the development of new work by artists, musicians, humanists, and other researchers. Programs will include public online and in-person events, art exhibitions, postdoctoral fellowships, a faculty working group, and curriculum development that reaches across prison borders.</p>
<p><em>Visualizing Abolition</em> launched in fall 2020 at UC Santa Cruz to examine the ways people see and understand issues of mass incarceration, detention, and policing in the United States and abroad, challenging the prevailing social, economic, and political worldviews that prisons promote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last, tumultuous year, we have created art exhibitions and online events bringing together artists and scholars to engage with the issue of prisons, carcerality, and abolition,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;What we have come to understand is that there is a strong cultural attachment to prisons despite all the data that prove they perpetuate inequities and fail to make people safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal with <em>Visualizing Abolition</em> is to emphasize the roles art, music, and culture can play in a different mode of knowing, enabling us to move towards a more just future. This funding from the Mellon Foundation bolsters our efforts and gives us the resources to build something lasting at UC Santa Cruz. We are so appreciative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beyond grateful to the foundation for this support,&#8221; Nelson added. &#8220;It&#8217;s especially thrilling to be able to continue this incredibly meaningful collaboration between the arts and humanities. The Institute of the Arts and Sciences was created in the Arts Division with the belief that the arts can bring together people from across the campus and in our communities around shared social justice concerns. Partnering with Professor Dent last year, we were able to highlight UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s long and important commitment to prison abolition across the disciplines by featuring the work of current and emeriti faculty in the social sciences, arts, and humanities along with that of many collaborators. It&#8217;s gratifying now to be able to cultivate new creative research and teaching on art and abolition through exhibitions and educational endeavors that cross prison borders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The award funds a range of exhibitions and programming for the campus community and larger publics. A partnership with the San Jos&#233; Museum of Art, the largest contemporary art museum in Silicon Valley, will help to ensure the program&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a transformative gift for UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;<em>Visualizing Abolition</em>&#160;is poised to be one of the largest, most expansive public scholarship initiatives ever on art and prison abolition. This award allows us to increase the impact and visibility far beyond our university of the important scholarship unfolding on our campus about incarceration and social justice.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="51d7b321807270466cc00b007fe696b0"><name>keynote-water-conservation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Help conserve water with Santa Cruz in extreme drought</title><summary>Through at least October, UCSC is required to reduce its water consumption by 9%.

<h2>You can help UCSC conserve water</h2>
<p>Please report any leaks&#8212;no matter how small&#8212;by going to <a href="http://fixit.ucsc.edu/">fixit.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>A few water-saving tips:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Shorten your showers.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Run full loads in the laundry or dishwashing machines.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Turn off the water when soaping your hands, shaving, brushing your teeth, and washing dishes.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Don't let dishes sit out, since dishes with dried-on food are harder to wash.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Encourage your peers to be water efficient and aware.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Historic water conservation success&#160;</h2>
<p>Over the last two decades, UCSC has taken ambitious steps to reduce our water use. We&#8217;ve retrofitted plumbing fixtures, replaced turf, greatly improved our metering and monitoring program to quickly capture leaks, and launched educational programs for students and employees. These continuous investments have enabled UCSC to exceed the UC goal of a 36% reduction in potable water use from the baseline years of 2005-2008 - all while significantly increasing enrollment. You can follow UCSC's water use reduction against the UC Office of the President&#8217;s goals annually by accessing the <a href="https://sustainabilityreport.ucop.edu/">UC Annual Report on Sustainable Practices</a>.&#160;<img alt="" height="237" src="../../tuesday-newsday/2021/october-05/images/ucsc-water-use-700px.png" style="display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;" width="700"/></p>
<p>Regionally, UCSC is doing its part to conserve. While housing more than 50% of its students on campus, which is over 10% of the population served by the water district, campus uses only about 6% of the water supply.</p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>The campus has established a Drought Response Working Group to identify projects and strategies to cope with the current drought and to ensure that the campus is meeting current water restrictions.</p>
<p>Facing the inevitableness of climate change impacts like future droughts, water conservation must become a way of life for all of us. Thank you for doing your part, helping UCSC reach its water reduction goals, and aiding local aquatic systems in the San Lorenzo River by reducing water waste.</p>

<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>We continue to be so proud of our Banana Slug community. We know there was a lot to do and learn as we resumed in-person activities this fall. It&#8217;s gone incredibly well.&#160;</p>
<p>From Sept. 27 to Oct. 3, the campus diagnostic lab processed more than 4,000 tests and our vendor Fulgent processed more than 2,600 tests for COVID-19. A total of seven cases were identified. Five were from students living off campus and two were from employees. There's no evidence of community spread, and our campus positivity rate is at .19 percent</p>
<p>With fall underway, we&#8217;re turning our attention to the other ways we can help avoid serious illness&#8212;flu shots. Students can get a flu vaccine on campus, while employees should look to their healthcare provider.&#160;</p>

Ejection of the envelope leaves the neutron star in a close orbit with a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the system depends on the mass ratio. Less-massive stripped stars experience an additional mass transfer phase that further strips the star and recycles the pulsar companion, leading to systems such as the observed binary neutron stars in the Milky Way and GW170817 (b). More massive stripped stars do not expand as much, therefore avoiding further stripping and companion recycling, leading to systems such as GW190425 (c). Finally, even more massive stripped stars with will lead to black hole-neutron star binaries such as GW200115 (d).

<p>The first detection of gravitational waves by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2017 was a neutron star merger that mostly conformed to the expectations of astrophysicists. But the second detection, in 2019, was a merger of two neutron stars whose combined mass was unexpectedly large.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was so shocking that we had to start thinking about how to create a heavy neutron star without making it a pulsar,&#8221; said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Compact astrophysical objects like neutron stars and black holes are challenging to study because when they are stable they tend to be invisible, emitting no detectable radiation. &#8220;That means we are biased in what we can observe,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz explained. &#8220;We have detected neutron star binaries in our galaxy when one of them is a pulsar, and the masses of those pulsars are almost all identical&#8212;we don&#8217;t see any heavy neutron stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>LIGO&#8217;s detection of a heavy neutron star merger at a rate similar to the lighter binary system implies that heavy neutron star pairs should be relatively common. So why don&#8217;t they show up in the pulsar population?</p>
<p>In the new study, Ramirez-Ruiz and his colleagues focused on the supernovae of stripped stars in binary systems that can form &#8220;double compact objects&#8221; consisting of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. A stripped star, also called a helium star, is a star that has had its hydrogen envelope removed by its interactions with a companion star.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac2903">published October 8 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>, was led by Alejandro Vigna-Gomez, an astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen&#8217;s Niels Bohr Institute, where Ramirez-Ruiz holds a Niels Bohr Professorship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used detailed stellar models to follow the evolution of a stripped star until the moment it explodes in a supernova,&#8221; Vigna-Gomez said. &#8220;Once we reach the time of the supernova, we do a hydrodynamical study, where we are interested in following the evolution of the exploding gas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stripped star, in a binary system with a neutron star companion, starts out ten times more massive than our sun, but so dense it is smaller than the sun in diameter. The final stage in its evolution is a core-collapse supernova, which leaves behind either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the final mass of the core.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s results showed that when the massive stripped star explodes, some of its outer layers are rapidly ejected from the binary system. Some of the inner layers, however, are not ejected and eventually fall back onto the newly formed compact object.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of material accreted depends on the explosion energy&#8212;the higher the energy, the less mass you can keep,&#8221; Vigna-Gomez said. &#8220;For our ten-solar-mass stripped star, if the explosion energy is low, it will form a black hole; if the energy is large, it will keep less mass and form a neutron star.&#8221;</p>
<p>These results not only explain the formation of heavy neutron star binary systems, such as the one revealed by the gravitational wave event GW190425, but also predict the formation of neutron star and light black hole binaries, such as the one that merged in the 2020 gravitational wave event GW200115.</p>
<p>Another important finding is that the mass of the helium core of the stripped star is essential in determining the nature of its interactions with its neutron star companion and the ultimate fate of the binary system. A sufficiently massive helium star can avoid transferring mass onto the neutron star. With a less massive helium star, however, the mass transfer process can transform the neutron star into a rapidly spinning pulsar.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the helium core is small, it expands, and then mass transfer spins up the neutron star to create a pulsar,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz explained. &#8220;Massive helium cores, however, are more gravitationally bound and don&#8217;t expand, so there is no mass transfer. And if they don&#8217;t spin up into a pulsar, we don&#8217;t see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, there may well be a large undetected population of heavy neutron star binaries in our galaxy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transferring mass onto a neutron star is an effective mechanism to create rapidly spinning (millisecond) pulsars,&#8221; Vigna-Gomez said. &#8220;Avoiding this mass transfer episode as we suggest hints that there is a radio-quiet population of such systems in the Milky Way.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renowned conductor Kent Nagano (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter &#8217;74, music, sociology) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made an impassioned defense of the arts last week after receiving the first-ever Distinguished Banana Slug Arts Award, recognizing his outstanding career as a conductor, musician, and mentor.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-nagano-kent.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, appearing on campus at the first UCSC Arts Convocation, an event established by new Arts Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, described live music as a powerful force, breaking down barriers and making our differences seem irrelevant. Quoting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Les Mis&#233;rables</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> author Victor Hugo, Nagano said that &#8220;Music expresses that which cannot be said, and on which it is impossible to remain silent."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The convocation was held at <span>the Mainstage Theater, w</span>ith mask requirements and a limited crowd. Overflow seating was available at the nearby Second Stage Theater via Zoom.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremony was a high-profile collaboration between the staff of the Department of Performance, Play and Design and the Arts Division staff.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagano is the director of the Hamburg State Opera. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagano's early professional years were spent in Boston, working with Seiji Ozawa at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1984, Olivier Messiaen selected Nagano to assist in premiering his opera, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saint Fran&#231;ois d'Assise</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A distinguished and in-demand guest conductor, he has worked with most of the world's finest orchestras, including the Vienna, Berlin, and New York Philharmonic Orchestras. He has recorded widely, receiving </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/Nagano-Grammy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple Grammy Awards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as multiple prizes from Grammophone, Grand Prix du Disque, Edison, ECHO, and Musical America (Conductor of the Year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagano received the Distinguished Banana Slug Award in the form of a special bronze</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statue of a banana slug on a rock that was made at the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/bronze-pour.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Foundry</span></a> by staff member J. Gaston.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dean Shimizu said the goal of the prize was &#8220;to honor the achievements of our distinguished alumnus, and to welcome him home with a promise to build upon Maestro Nagano&#8217;s legacy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why do we need the arts?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me begin by asking a question: Why do we need the arts?&#8221; Nagano asked the convocation audience. &#8220;Why do human beings need aesthetics? These questions have been asked throughout the history of mankind and are the ones I was asked by many people, especially my parents, when I announced I wanted to study music at UCSC. You will confront this question again and again, and your answers will guide the pathways of your career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the answer, Nagano turned not only to the wise words of Victor Hugo but to the philosophies of the Canadian author Northrop Frye, who once remarked that the natural sciences can help us to explain the world that surrounds us, but &#8220;the arts begin at the edge of the world we can imagine, the one that we construct in our minds, not the one that we see around us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is why the arts are so essential, especially now during a turning point for society, in which arts are under constant threat, their importance questioned, their importance to social development underestimated," Nagano continued.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the viewpoint reflected by many governments around the world,&#8221; Nagano said. &#8220;In its place in the 21st century is an entire canon of values that have been established internationally, a canon that places the economic above the social experience, above inner fulfillment. These have become the priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art cannot be quantified [in economic terms],&#8221; Nagano continued. &#8220;It is part of a value system which fundamentally reflects the humanism of the age of enlightenment, which is to say individual freedom, community equality, and inclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A strong message of inclusion&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who spoke at last week&#8217;s convocation kept returning to the theme of inclusion. Campus&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer called attention to UCSC Arts Division&#8217;s world-class faculty of scholars and practicing artists and its ethos of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Kletzer, in her remarks, placed a special emphasis on a guiding principle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are also distinguished by our belief that all students regardless of degree level and prior background should be afforded an opportunity to engage in the kind of interdisciplinary work that happens in this division,&#8221; Kletzer said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the convocation, Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, who started work as the new Arts Division dean in July, sustained that theme of equity and inclusion in her Dean&#8217;s Vision Statement for the Arts, which invited the community to join together in shared purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of her remarks, Shimizu called attention to the joyous nature of the gathering, while paying her respects to the victims of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this new academic year, we are emerging from the pandemic, suffering from living in isolation among mass death,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I myself lost an entire generation in my family. The way I define mourning is the deep sorrow that comes from feeling excessively alive in the aftermath of loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this time of grief and ongoing anxiety, the joy of being in proximity and in community is indeed so happy, yet full of solemnity. We are here today exploring what it means to begin again in the university where we share this great, grand enterprise of learning, growing, and finding our paths. I aim for us to have the audacity to create, imagine, and act."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimizu, an award-winning filmmaker and scholar, shared her vision to communicate how diversity, equity, and inclusion foster excellence in the arts, with programmatic innovations including mentorships, funding for scholarships and faculty research, and strong advocacy for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is no excellence without equity," Shimizu said, &#8220;and no innovation without inclusion. No one should face obstacles to learning or impediments to their education, especially for art students pursuing degrees that not all parents are excited about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The industry is so competitive to enter,&#8221; Shimizu continued. &#8220;The pandemic teaches us how essential the arts are to our survival, yet we do not all have equal access to it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She reflected on the painful experiences captured in recent protests and movements, with hashtags including Time&#8217;s Up, Me To, and Oscars So White, which the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> described as &#8220;the hashtag that changed the Oscars&#8221; by calling attention to the &#8220;entrenched disparities&#8221; of representation in the entertainment industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though those statistics are disturbing, &#8220;the university is the place where this changes, so the people making art and contextualizing and interpreting narratives that organize our world represent a wider perspective. Look around: We are the voices of the century, the real change is us,&#8221; Shimizu said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimizu outlined a far-ranging vision plan that supports undergraduate and graduate student recruitment, retention, and success, while bolstering institutional partnerships with companies such as Pixar, Amazon, Lionsgate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Visual Communications Media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is widely known as an effective engine for social and economic mobility for our students and their families,&#8221; Shimizu said. &#8220;We help make this possible by demystifying how the arts can lead to careers."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the vision plan includes strong support for faculty innovation, research, and mentorships; and reaching out to staff members to ensure they have the institutional support that they need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My philosophy in working with staff and student workers is to make sure they know they are essential to and appreciated in the running of the institution, that work does not take over so that we sacrifice our enjoyment of the arts in our lives,&#8221; Shimizu said. &#8220;I am currently working with my senior staff on identifying how to make efficient processes informed by the necessity of empathy in these times in taking our collective grief and turning it into collective possibility."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Cynthia Larive reflected on Shimizu&#8217;s comment about excellence and inclusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are working hard to create an inclusive campus,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;We are committed to promoting and protecting an environment that values and supports every person, an atmosphere of respect, honesty, cooperation, and fairness. It is at the heart of who we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, the arts are incredibly important to our campus as they are to the human experience,&#8221; Larive continued. &#8220;The arts give meaning to our lives and help us understand our world.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fe04b54807270466cc00b0046c65092"><name>pge-outages</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz locations not included in potential PG&amp;E power outages</title><summary>Pacific Gas and Electric has announced that it may turn off power to some parts of California on Monday to reduce the risk of power lines sparking a wildfire. </summary><start-date>1633676400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz locations not included in potential PG&amp;E power outages</display-name><path>/2021/10/pge-outages</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/pge-outages</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1633964542770</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633964542770</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Pacific Gas and Electric has announced that it may turn off power to some parts of California on Monday to reduce the risk of power lines sparking a wildfire.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As of Sunday afternoon, UC Santa Cruz and its sites within Monterey and Santa Clara counties are not expected to be affected by the possible power outages.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The planned power outage is expected to affect areas in the following counties: Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Kings, Lake, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Plumas, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Shasta, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tehama, and Yolo.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings&#8212;indicating an increased risk of extreme fire danger&#8212;for the Santa Cruz mountains and parts of the Bay Area. The warning is in effect until 8 p.m. Monday.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The wildfire danger to our campus is real and potentially devastating, as current dry conditions have created an explosive environment. The campus fire-danger is currently rated high. We must do our part to prevent a repeat of last summer&#8217;s devastating fire. Anyone who smells smoke or sees a fire should immediately dial 911.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campus leaders continue to monitor the situation, and the UCSC Office of Emergency Services has been in close communication with PG&amp;E officials.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz will update the campus community should the situation change.</span></p>

<p>The fellowship recipients are <strong>Gillian Bogart</strong>, a graduate student pursuing her Ph.D. in sociocultural anthropology; <strong>Jasmeet Dhaliwal</strong>, a postdoctoral scholar in Earth and planetary sciences; and <strong>Brenna Mockler</strong>, a graduate student pursuing her Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>Gillian Bogart is an anthropologist whose work explores social and ecological transformation, especially in relation to capital-driven disturbance. Her current project is a study of salt production on Timor island and the impacts of Indonesia&#8217;s national salt self-sufficiency initiative on fisher-farmer communities, coastal ecologies, and the human-nonhuman relations that animate them. Her nascent research program focuses on women&#8217;s vernacular livelihood practices.</p>
<p>Jasmeet Dhaliwal is a planetary scientist who studies the chemistry of the early solar system and how it has influenced planet formation and evolution. She is actively involved in science outreach education for K-12 students, as well as efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Earth and planetary sciences. She eventually hopes to become a professor and develop interdisciplinary research with her colleagues to advance social-justice issues in the field.</p>
<p>Brenna Mockler&#8217;s research focuses on understanding the growth and behavior of supermassive black holes, such as the one at the center of our own galaxy. Her current work studies stars captured and engulfed by black holes to learn about how fast black holes can grow. She is also deeply committed to improving the culture in astronomy and academia and believes that advancing equity and inclusion in academic research is vital to its success.</p>
<p>AAUW is one of the world&#8217;s oldest leading supporters of graduate women&#8217;s education. Since 1888, it has awarded more than $115 million in fellowships, grants, and awards to 13,000 women from 150 countries. For the 2021&#8211;22 academic year, AAUW has awarded a total of an unprecedented $5 million through its fellowships and grants programs to 260 scholars as well as to community projects and programs that promote education and equity for women and girls.</p>
<p>Educational funding is especially important for women since they are disproportionately burdened by student debt. The burden is exacerbated by a lifelong pay gap that affects women in nearly every profession. The pay gap widens over time and has negative impacts on all aspect of a woman&#8217;s financial life, from paying college tuition to saving for a comfortable retirement. AAUW&#8217;s awards help to alleviate the burden of student debt so women can focus on their education and academic pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to support the work of these outstanding scholars,&#8221; said Gloria Blackwell, AAUW executive vice president and chief programs officer. &#8220;This year&#8217;s recipients are making valuable contributions in a wide range of fields, but with a common goal of improving life for all of us. We&#8217;re impressed by what these scholars are doing and excited about the great things they&#8217;ll accomplish throughout their research and careers.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="702e7559807270466cc00b0024b13f98"><name>beltran-packard-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Roxanne Beltran wins prestigious Packard Fellowship</title><summary>The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering to Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. </summary><start-date>1634216400000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Roxanne Beltran wins prestigious Packard Fellowship</display-name><path>/2021/10/beltran-packard-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/beltran-packard-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1633969665352</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634357866918</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-350b.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-350b.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>roxanne-beltran-350b.jpg</name><display-name>roxanne-beltran-350b.jpg</display-name><file-size>70768</file-size><width>350</width><height>493</height></image><image-alt>Roxanne Beltran</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>roxanne-beltran-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>roxanne-beltran-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24313</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Roxanne Beltran</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Roxanne Beltran</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering to Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. The Packard Fellowships support young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity.&#160;</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowship gives Beltran $875,000 over the next five years to support her research using migrating elephant seals as &#8220;smart sensors&#8221; for monitoring ocean ecosystems. By outfitting female elephant seals with a compact array of sophisticated instruments, Beltran&#8217;s research group will collect large-scale, long-term, three-dimensional data on ocean health as the seals travel great distances across the North Pacific Ocean on their 7-month foraging migrations.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The elephant seals we work with are so reliable and so smart, they can take us directly to the ecologically important areas of the ocean,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;The open ocean looks homogenous to humans, but the seals make a living out there by detecting the areas where prey are plentiful, and we can leverage those abilities for science.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Fast, quiet, far-ranging, and deep-diving, female elephant seals are ideal platforms for oceanographic sensors. During foraging migrations, they travel some 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) while diving continually to depths of around 2,000 feet (700 meters). When the seals return to their breeding beaches in California, researchers can recover the instruments attached harmlessly to the animals&#8217; fur. Multiple studies have shown that carrying the tags does not change the seals&#8217; behavior.&#160;</p>
<p>UCSC researchers have been studying the elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve north of Santa Cruz for more than 50 years, and Beltran is building on the knowledge and experience gained from this long-term research program.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we know the age and history of each seal, we can instrument specific animals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We know which seals will go to certain places or come back consistently, and that makes them dependable partners for this project.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>In conjunction with her recent <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/06/beltran-beckman-grant.html">Beckman Young Investigator</a> award, Beltran will deploy 20 seals each year with sensors to collect data on everything from temperature and salinity to chlorophyll levels (for measuring phytoplankton abundance), as well as sonar and sound recordings. The data will provide a wealth of environmental and biological information from across the northeast Pacific Ocean, allowing Beltran to track productivity in the open ocean, predator-prey interactions, and the effects of ocean noise and ocean warming.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know so little about what goes on in the open ocean, I&#8217;m excited to discover what&#8217;s out there,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;This approach opens the door for endless possibilities. For example, acoustic tags can record whale sounds, and sonar tags have recently been developed to estimate prey availability, so you can imagine combining those to see how the abundance of whales relates to prey availability, and then dig into the oceanographic drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowship will allow Beltran to support a field technician and a graduate student, as well as a dozen undergraduate student researchers each year. &#8220;It will take a team effort to get this done, and I&#8217;m excited for the next generation of marine mammal scientists to be trained in this program,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In partnership with Dan Costa and his team, we just selected our first cohort of 12 undergraduate students to become elephant seal researchers in the next few weeks. It&#8217;s a special opportunity to let them find their own niches in this exciting science.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowships provide early-career scientists and engineers with flexible funding and the freedom to take risks and explore new frontiers in their fields of study. The Packard Foundation selects 20 fellows each year for these prestigious grants.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when we are confronting so many difficult, intertwined challenges, including climate change, a global pandemic, and racial injustice, I am buoyed by the determination and energy of these 20 scientists and engineers,&#8221; said Nancy Lindborg, Packard Foundation President and CEO. &#8220;Through their research, creativity, and mentorship to their students and in their labs, these young leaders have the potential to help equip us all to better understand and address the challenges we face.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/wcnENQTZyx0</url><title>VIDEO: Meet the 2021 Class of Packard Fellows for Science and Engineering</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/roxanne-beltran-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>roxanne-beltran-featured.jpg</name><display-name>roxanne-beltran-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>4680</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Roxanne Beltran</thumb-alt><title>Roxanne Beltran: Packard Award Winner</title><description>Roxanne Beltran (Stevenson â13, marine biology), assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, was awarded a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, giving her $875,000 over the next five years to support her research.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="71afe00b807270466cc00b004fe50c65"><name>emergency-alert-test</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Test of community emergency alert system set for Oct. 21</title><summary>Santa Cruz County emergency response officials are planning a test of the countyâs alert and warning system Thursday, Oct. 21 at 10 a.m.</summary><start-date>1633989600000</start-date><display-name>emergency alert test </display-name><path>/2021/10/emergency-alert-test</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/emergency-alert-test</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1633994924022</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633994924022</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz County emergency response officials are planning a test of the county&#8217;s alert and warning system Thursday, Oct. 21 at 10 a.m.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone on or off campus who has the alert app called &#8220;CodeRED&#8221; on their phone or who has signed up for the service may receive the message.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery, and Resilience (OR3),&#160; the county Sheriff's Office, and Santa Cruz Regional 9-1-1 are organizing the test to help community disaster preparedness.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of an actual emergency, alerts may be used to warn residents of natural disasters or other impending dangers, alert them to care and shelter resources, provide boil water notices and other public health information.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents with landlines, as well those who have registered their cell phones,VoIP (cable) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones, and emails, or who have downloaded the CodeRED app, will receive the alerts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To assure participation in the drill, all residents are encouraged to register landlines, cell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones, or VoIP phones with CodeRED by visiting scr911.org and signing up for notifications, or texting SCR911 to 99411.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are also encouraged to download the CodeRed app to their smart devices, allowing them to receive notifications based on their location. Residents may verify enrollment by visiting </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2mxrnv4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tinyurl.com/y2mxrnv4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Residents are also encouraged to add (866) 419-5000 and (218) 350-0131 as the two possible caller-ID phone numbers used by CodeRED. They will identify the call as a recognized contact.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If users have difficulty with the CodeRED system or need assistance with login credentials, call (866) 939-0911 or email </span><a href="mailto:crsupport@onsolve.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crsupport@onsolve.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the alert, no further action is needed from residents. However, if anyone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to receive the alert but did not, they are encouraged to update their registration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">information or call CodeRED to verify registration.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents will not receive an alert unless they have a landline, have enrolled their contact information with CodeRED, or have downloaded the CodeRED app. All residents are encouraged to enroll. For critical information during emergencies, residents are encouraged to follow emergency response agencies on social media as well as local news and radio. </span></p>

It has the power to change the life trajectories of our students, springboarding tomorrow&#8217;s innovators, critical thinkers, and organizational and community leaders into the world. Over the past two years, our entire institution has re-examined and recommitted to what it means to be a truly student-serving institution with an extraordinary research profile. Simply put, we know that we must pull every lever available to us to ensure our students succeed in both the short and long term, and that all of our students have full access to the wide range of opportunities this great university provides.&#160;</p>
<p>With this commitment to access, I am thrilled to announce the official launch of our Student Success Initiative. This wide-ranging effort will increase financial support for our undergraduate and graduate students, and advance their access to the guidance and experiences fundamental to their education and ultimately future success. Through this five-year initiative, we will enhance our existing resources and develop new programs, opportunities, and other means of support for our students. Our efforts will fall into three broad themes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The cost of higher education should not hinder any student. We will work to provide additional financial support to our undergraduates and graduate students in need through scholarships and fellowships to ensure they have access to all the educational, research and working-world experiences we offer.&#160;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Navigating university life can be overwhelming for some students. New initiatives across campus will add to the programs we already have in place, providing students the support they need to develop the skills required to find future personal and professional success.</li>
<li aria-level="1">UCSC is known for its whole-student approach to education, cultivating life-changing opportunities and providing students with a well-rounded educational experience. Philanthropic support will allow us to expand the number and range of opportunities we offer, deepening both individual and community impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our new <a href="http://success.ucsc.edu/">Student Success Initiative website</a> is a great source of information. Please take a few minutes to more fully explore this initiative and learn about the many ways it will help students get the most out of their UC Santa Cruz education, enabling future success and social mobility.&#160;</p>
<p>Our campus has long been a supporter of equity and social justice, and we already are making a difference in the lives of thousands of students. My hope is that through our Student Success Initiative and the philanthropic support of our extended community we can expand that number exponentially, showing ourselves to be a leader at the intersection of innovation and social justice, seeking solutions, and giving voice to the challenges of our time. Together we can create transformative change.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75cef8eb807270466cc00b0094374b94"><name>informational-picket</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Drive safely with increased pedestrian activity at campus entrances on Wednesday, Thursday</title><summary>UC-AFT, the labor union that represents lecturers, has announced it will hold systemwide informational pickets on Wednesday and Thursday, October 13-14. </summary><start-date>1634022000000</start-date><display-name>Drive safely with increased pedestrian activity at campus entrances on Wednesday, Thursday</display-name><path>/2021/10/informational-picket</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/informational-picket</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634064070876</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634064070876</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UC-AFT, the labor union that represents lecturers, has announced it will hold systemwide informational pickets on Wednesday and Thursday, October 13-14.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At UC Santa Cruz, the labor union has shared that there will be informational pickets both days from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at both entrances to the residential campus. UC-AFT has also announced an event at noon in the Quarry Plaza on both days which may result in unusually heavy pedestrian travel on roadways during that time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Motorists should take extra precautions as they drive on and through campus. Everyone should plan for possible traffic congestion or travel delays. Campus Transit shuttles will be running as scheduled, though METRO buses may not enter campus when there are picketers. In that situation, they will drop riders off at the Barn Theater and riders can board a Campus Transit shuttle nearby.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Based on current information, we anticipate teaching, research, and university business to continue as scheduled.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="761b089f807270466cc00b00ed38f260"><name>chancellor-fall-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>October 20th Fall Forum with Chancellor Larive</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board seeks to continue supporting staff by amplifying your voices to campus leadership.</summary><start-date>1634022000000</start-date><display-name>October 20th Fall Forum with Chancellor Larive</display-name><path>/2021/10/chancellor-fall-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/chancellor-fall-forum</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634069055627</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634069055627</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>We hope this message finds you and your loved ones in good spirits and exceptional health.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Campus Community,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope everyone has hit their stride as we enter the third full week of instruction. Our combination of having a highly vaccinated campus community, requiring face coverings indoors, and regular asymptomatic testing program continues to be effective.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our campus lab ran nearly 2,000 tests from Oct. 4-10 and our vendor Fulgent ran an additional 286 tests. Six students&#8212;two on campus and four off campus&#8212;and two employees tested positive. All are taking the appropriate precautions to avoid further spread. We have found no evidence of community spread.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate everyone&#8217;s efforts in helping to support the community&#8217;s health and well-being. As you can see, it makes a difference.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary of Updates</span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status update on campus and in Santa Cruz County</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like last year, UC requiring flu vaccines for students, employees</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Status Update</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small number of positive COVID-19 tests among students:&#160;</strong>As mentioned above, we recorded six positive cases among students and two among employees. Two of the students live on campus and four live off campus.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>High vaccination rate in our campus community:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As of today, 95 percent of UC Santa Cruz students and 98 percent of employees have complied with our COVID vaccine policy. The campus continues to work toward bringing the remaining people into compliance.&#160;</span></li>
<li><strong>Slug Strong dashboard offers regular updates:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our </span><a href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 dashboard is updated regularly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and provides a breakdown of COVID-19 cases.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome.aspx">Santa Cruz County dashboard</a> shows decline in new cases: <span style="font-weight: 400;">The county currently has 441 active cases, which is a 21 percent decline over the past 14 days.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mask up!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though Santa Cruz County no longer has a mask mandate, UC Santa Cruz continues to require face coverings in most indoor situations.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Like last year, UC requiring flu vaccines for students, employees</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California last week <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/10/flu-vaccination-requirement-for-uc-students,-faculty-and-staff-issued-for-2021-2022.html">issued a systemwide executive order</a> requiring all covered students, faculty, other academic appointees and staff to, by Nov. 19, 2021, get vaccinated against influenza or opt out using a form supplied by their location after receiving information about flu vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus will provide more information about how to submit proof of a flu vaccine soon. In the meantime, everyone should try to get vaccinated when they have the time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Students can get flu shots Oct. 27-28 at the Hay Barn. Registration details are coming soon.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the meantime, keep an eye on the Student Health Center </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/immunizations.html#flu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immunizations page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees should contact their healthcare provider to find out how to get a flu vaccine.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="76cd058e807270466cc00b00c747fb93"><name>winter-curtailment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Winter Curtailment 2021-2022</title><summary>Our 2021-22 winter curtailment will run from Thursday, December 23 through Friday, December 31, 2021.

<p><span>This notice is being sent in advance of the campus communication going out on Wednesday, October 13th, to allow you to anticipate supporting your staff with any questions or requests that may arise.</span></p>
<p><span>Our 2021-22 winter curtailment will run from Thursday, December 23 through Friday, December 31, 2021. Work is scheduled to resume on Monday, January 3, 2022.</span></p>
<span></span><span></span>
<ul>
<li><span>December 23, 24, 30, and 31, 2021 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</span></li>
<li><span>December 27, 28, and 29, 2021 are the three (3) curtailment days</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or take leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for December 27, 28, and 29, 2021. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the winter curtailment period. Those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure.</span></p>
<p><span>In certain cases staff employees will be required to work during some or all of this period due to the nature of their jobs. Any staff employee, regardless of their work location, including remote work, may work only with the explicit approval of their principal officer/designee and supervisor.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the winter curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Winter Curtailment" memo that will be coming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time.</span></p>

California (USC) released a new book, </span><a href="https://solidarityeconomics.org/se-book/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics: Why Mutuality and Movements Matter</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that offers a road map and conceptual framework for equity-driven economic reform in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology and Environmental Studies Professor Chris Benner&#8212;director of the Institute for Social Transformation and the Everett Program for Technology and Social Change&#8212;has been collaborating for the past 20 years with USC Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Director of USC&#8217;s Equity Research Institute Manuel Pastor. Together, they use interdisciplinary research methods to study the relationship between social equity and economic growth.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the term &#8220;solidarity economy&#8221; often refers to post-capitalist movements, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Benner and Pastor&#8217;s fifth book together, instead focuses on applying research findings to challenge traditional notions about how our current economy actually works and to envision how it could and should operate better.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the key concepts we&#8217;re communicating is that it&#8217;s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> economy, it&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> economy,&#8221; Benner explained. &#8220;Our dominant conception is this idea of economic forces as being like laws of nature, when in fact, markets are fundamentally shaped by human values and legal and regulatory structures, as well as by social relationships rooted in particular places and spaces.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argues that we can change our economy, and the types of results it produces, by changing what we prioritize. In particular, to address inequality, social divisions, and ecological destruction in our current economic and political system, Benner and Pastor say we must look beyond individualism and competition to recognize and reinforce the aspects of our economy that are already built upon mutuality and collaboration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, teamwork allows companies to provide products and services. Technological innovation, meanwhile, builds upon existing collective knowledge and often involves public investment or collaboration across organizations. And the service sector and caring labor support just about all other forms of economic activity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sheds light on why the collaborative nature of these endeavors often goes unrecognized and uncompensated. Patents, trade secrets, and monopolies are just a few of the ways that wealth can amass in the hands of a few, despite the contributions of many. This inequality ultimately harms individuals, communities, and the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Traditional economic thinking suggests that fairness comes at the cost of prosperity,&#8221; said Pastor, who is a UC Santa Cruz alumnus and taught at UCSC from 1996 to 2007. &#8220;But a wave of new research shows that regions and nations that are more equal and less racially segregated are actually better able to sustain prosperity over time. But to get there, we need to make sure that equity is baked in, not sprinkled on.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bake in racial and social equity and build a more just economy, community members, policymakers, and the private sector all have a role to play. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains how better targeting of public sector investment could steer innovation toward the public good, and how social entrepreneurship, employee-owned companies, and employee share ownership could be further incentivized. The book also advocates for guaranteed public jobs and a &#8220;social wage&#8221; that would offer a baseline level of prosperity for all.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> envisions a right to essentials like health, housing, and income, in recognition of the universal and sometimes hard-to-quantify ways that we all invest in collective well-being. Those investments deserve some form of guaranteed returns, Pastor and Benner say. They also argue that our economy should interact with the natural environment in ways that value future well-being, for both people and the planet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discusses how economic progress could be decoupled from resource use through circular and regenerative economies. And the book recommends how today&#8217;s business, consumer, and policy decisions could work to minimize risk from climate change and environmental degradation.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since there are some who benefit greatly from &#8220;business as usual&#8221; in our current economy, Benner and Pastor argue that change will require major social movements to disrupt entrenched power dynamics. The book intends to support coalition building for these efforts and argues why challenging deeply rooted structural racism is so key to forging alliances that can last.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is written in a format that&#8217;s meant to be accessible for the public, and it&#8217;s available as a </span><a href="https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509544073"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free download</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additional resources will be released in the coming year to support broad dissemination, including a video series and a </span><a href="https://solidarityeconomics.org/solidarity-economics-comic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version of the book.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe that bolstering and expanding movements across boundaries like political ideology, race, gender, and income could be a key turning point in achieving the book&#8217;s vision for an equitable economy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Movements shift power, but also, in the same way that markets often make people selfish, movements make people mutual,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;When people start coming together to achieve common visions and values, it transforms us in ways that reinforce our investment in each other and the common good.&#8221;</span></p>

But he didn&#8217;t know how.</p>
<p>He was excited when after his first quarter at the university, he was invited to apply for the <a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/honors-programs/college-scholars/index.html">College Scholars Program</a>, which helps first-year students explore undergraduate research opportunities.</p>
<p>Students in the program get to hear presentations from faculty members in a wide range of disciplines about their research. &#8220;This was a big way to understand how the college system works,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Braly is now a <a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/koretscholars/">Koret Undergraduate Research Scholar</a> studying yersinia bacteria in the lab run by Vicki Auerbuch Stone, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology.</p>
<p>Soon, the opportunity Braly received may be extended to a wider audience, said Amanda M. Smith, the new faculty director of UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/index.html">Undergraduate Honors Programs</a>, including the College Scholars Program.</p>
<p>While the current website for the College Scholars Program says the program is open to &#8220;highly prepared&#8221; frosh students, Smith, an assistant professor in literature, would like to change that to &#8220;highly motivated&#8221; students.</p>
<p>Regardless of the opportunities students may or may not have had before coming to UC Santa Cruz, those who are interested in research should have the chance to engage in deep inquiry, Smith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want them to start to think of themselves as part of the production of knowledge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not just in classes passively learning things, they&#8217;re participating in human thought and making new ideas and testing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, students may only enter the program two ways: they are either invited before their fall start on the basis of their grades and test scores, or they can apply for entrance, as Braly did, to begin the program in the spring. About 90 freshmen are enrolled in the program now.</p>
<p>This year, the theme of &#8220;integrity&#8221; will frame the first-year activities. For one of the fall activities, College Scholar students will be asked to contact professors and interview them about what integrity in research means to them.</p>
<p>Smith said she and the college provosts selected &#8220;integrity&#8221; as a theme because it seems so pertinent to the times. &#8220;Integrity literally means wholeness,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;A lot of us don&#8217;t feel whole right now after everything we&#8217;ve endured over the last couple of years. How can we be whole in the midst of this chaos and uncertainty? How can we create conditions for those around us to feel whole, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>College Scholars will also be asked to reflect on what integrity means to them when it comes to the service-learning course they will complete during winter term. They will have to consider how best to work with a community organization in a limited time without using up too many resources, Smith said. Smith hopes a diverse group of students will be inspired to apply for the College Scholars Program in the future.</p>
<p>Abigail Eduardo Espinosa, a senior who participated her first year, said the program is worth the effort. A first-generation student now majoring in psychology and sociology, Espinosa said the program opened her eyes to how much research was going on at the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would definitely recommend it to students especially if they don&#8217;t have prior knowledge about research,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7fa047b6807270466cc00b007e3b6826"><name>arl-invitation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Library invited to join prestigious Association of Research Libraries</title><summary>The ARL is a nonprofit membership organization of more than 120 libraries and archives at major public and private universities, federal government agencies, and large public institutions in the United States and Canada. </summary><start-date>1634194800000</start-date><display-name>Association of Research Libraries</display-name><path>/2021/10/arl-invitation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/arl-invitation</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1634228783010</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634230210084</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Marc DesJardins</name><title></title><phone/><email>marc@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/mchenry-library-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/mchenry-library-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mchenry-library-500px.jpg</name><display-name>mchenry-library-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>328968</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Outside of McHenry Library</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/mchenry-library-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/mchenry-library-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mchenry-library-80px.jpg</name><display-name>mchenry-library-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>16803</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Outside of McHenry Library</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The invitation followed a rigorous ARL review of the UCSC University Library over the past year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University Library at UC Santa Cruz has accepted an invitation to join&#160;</span><a href="https://www.arl.org/news/university-of-california-santa-cruz-to-become-126th-member-of-arl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Association of Research Libraries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effective January 1, 2022. The ARL is a nonprofit membership organization of more than 120 libraries and archives at major public and private universities, federal government agencies, and large public institutions in the United States and Canada. It serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and is a catalyst for collective action to create, share, and sustain global knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The membership of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) voted to invite the UC Santa Cruz Library to join ARL as the 126th member during its fall meeting, held&#160;<span>Sept. 28&#8211;Oct. 6.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the past 30 years, scholarship, teaching, and learning have changed tremendously,&#8221; said University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell. &#8220;How we absorb and disseminate information has been revolutionized. Libraries are not what they used to be. All this change means that serving library patrons is best done through intentional collaborative efforts. ARL gives us a stronger voice in the efforts to achieve barrier-free access to information. This election is a great honor for our team and for the university as a whole.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invitation followed a rigorous ARL review of the UCSC University Library over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC University Library is one of the smallest general libraries in the University of California system, but it has shown itself to be a research innovator. The library shares with other academic libraries a commitment to intellectual freedom and the widest possible access to information. This commitment is reflected in the library&#8217;s open stacks, active interlibrary loan service, systemwide online catalog, and a robust website linked to other sites and databases. The campus library also fosters mutually beneficial partnerships with libraries at other UC campuses. The UCSC Library is also part of the California Digital Library, founded by UC nearly 25 years ago to take advantage of emerging technologies that were transforming the way digital information was being published and accessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library&#8217;s manageable size and relative youth &#8212; it was founded in 1965, the year campus opened &#8212; have allowed it to grow responsively with the campus and to innovate and adapt with agility to new information technologies, always with an eye on strengthening our academic and research enterprise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our library is integral to our entire enterprise,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;Our goals are aligned &#8212; access and discovery, research and scholarship, diversity and student success. That&#8217;s not by accident. This alignment and the research our library team enables make our whole operation click. Our library is a place where students and faculty burst through boundaries. This recognition is wonderful and well-deserved.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7fdc38f3807270466cc00b00410c8f99"><name>tech-for-good</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CITRIS Tech for Social Good program invites student proposals</title><summary>The Tech for Social Good program provides up to $5,000 in funding for research projects and up to $1,000 for events.</summary><start-date>1634194800000</start-date><display-name>CITRIS Tech for Social Good program invites student proposals</display-name><path>/2021/10/tech-for-good</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/tech-for-good</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1634232711392</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634232951812</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/tsg-logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/tsg-logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tsg-logo.jpg</name><display-name>tsg-logo.jpg</display-name><file-size>27645</file-size><width>306</width><height>135</height></image><image-alt>TSG logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/tsg-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/tsg-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tsg-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tsg-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17587</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>TSG logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Tech for Social Good program provides up to $5,000 in funding for research projects and up to $1,000 for events</article-subhead><article-text><p>The 2021 CITRIS Tech for Social Good program at UC Santa Cruz is now open for proposals from student teams.

The institute was created to shorten the pipeline between world-class laboratory research and the development of cutting-edge applications, platforms, companies, and even new industries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81964f5b807270466cc00b006650dfc6"><name>association-of-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus library voted into prestigious association</title><summary>We are thrilled to announce that our campus was officially invited to join the prestigious Association of Research Libraries (ARL), with our membership effective January 1, 2022. </summary><start-date>1634194800000</start-date><display-name>Campus library voted into prestigious association</display-name><path>/2021/10/association-of-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/association-of-research</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634261684037</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634261684037</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are thrilled to announce that <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/arl-invitation.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634347562756000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKb6oDK2bOsz-ECNcitHlI5iFrIA" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/arl-invitation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our campus was officially invited to join the prestigious Association of Research Libraries</a> (ARL), with our membership effective January 1, 2022. The association is a nonprofit organization comprising roughly 125 libraries and archives at major public and private universities, federal government agencies, and large public institutions throughout North America. To be invited to join is both an honor and a testament to the great work unfolding in our campus library system, where our team is regularly creating and implementing ideas and services that advance our research, teaching, and learning.</p>
<p>The Association of Research Libraries serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and is a catalyst for collective action to create, share, and sustain global knowledge. The organization advocates on behalf of research libraries, convenes research and higher education partners, shares intelligence on current issues, and develops the next generation of diverse library leaders. At a time in history when we are witnessing intense change in scholarship, teaching, and learning &#8212; indeed, in the very nature of information &#8212; the collective initiatives the ARL undertakes are of great benefit. Members lead institutions that attract millions of users annually, leaving them uniquely positioned to champion change by proactively addressing the information challenges and opportunities facing the research and learning community.</p>
<p>The UCSC University Library, while one of the smallest general libraries in the UC system, has shown itself to be a research innovator. The library&#8217;s manageable size and relative youth &#8212; it was founded in 1965, the year our campus opened &#8212; have allowed it to grow responsively with the campus and to innovate and adapt with agility to new information technologies, always with an eye on strengthening our academic and research enterprise.</p>
<p>Our library strategic plan focuses on access and discovery, research and scholarship, diversity, and student success, mirroring our institutional commitment to those areas. That clear alignment between the mission of our library system and our strategic direction as a campus was a critical factor in our admission, as ARL leadership views that as an essential qualification.</p>
<p>Other important factors in our election was the equitable access the library provides to substantive and diverse information resources that address the full scope of research and learning on our campus, and our well-developed and still evolving use of digital tools and methods in support of teaching and research.</p>
<p>The ARL also requires its members to have significant activities in preserving and ensuring broad access to rare and unique holdings. We have a unique and rich Special Collections enterprise. Our collections include notable holdings of California photographers, the Lick Observatory Collection, a substantial Counter Culture collection including the Grateful Dead, and significant literary archives featuring papers from such authors as Robert Heinlein and Kenneth Patchen.</p>
<p>We are thrilled by this recognition of our outstanding University Library, recognizing that ARL invitations are coveted and few. This achievement is something our full campus community should take pride in.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor;  Elizabeth Cowell  Richard L.

<p><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/beth-shapiro/life-as-we-made-it/9781541644151/"><em>Life as We Made It</em> (Basic Books, October 2021)</a> explores the genetic modification of living things in the context of history, archeology, paleontology, and genomics. Subtitled &#8220;How 50,000 Years of Human Innovation Refined&#8212;and Redefined&#8212;Nature,&#8221; the book gives readers a solid grounding in the history of human interventions in nature, as well as the promise and pitfalls of how we might use new technologies for editing the genomes of other species, and ourselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about all the ways we humans have been messing with the species we interact with for the entire time we have existed,&#8221; said Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. &#8220;All the things people are afraid of that we&#8217;re doing today with genetic modifications are just an extension of what we&#8217;ve been doing for the past 50,000 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CRISPR gene-editing tool, whose inventors won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, enables scientists to make precise changes to an organism&#8217;s genome. In addition to being a powerful tool for fundamental research, precise gene editing has a wide range of potential applications in agriculture and medicine. But its ease of use also raises concerns about potentially dangerous or unethical uses of such technology.</p>
<p>In exploring the ethical and moral issues surrounding new technologies for genetic modification, Shapiro argues that blind opposition to the technology is naive and that the potential benefits are enormous if it is used wisely.</p>
<p>CRISPR pioneer and Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna called the book &#8220;a brilliant combination of science, natural history, and first-person experience.... Anyone who wants to better understand the future of life&#8212;human and otherwise&#8212;should read this book.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UCSC <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/">Science &amp; Justice Research Center</a> will host a book launch event on Wednesday, November 10, at which Shapiro will discuss her book with Science &amp; Justice Training Program Fellows Jonas Oppenheimer and Jenny Pensky. More information and Zoom registration for this event are available on the <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/2021/09/20/nov10-sjtp-shapiro-book/">SJRC web site</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="84f23af8807270466cc00b0042186948"><name>new-model-for-free-speech</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Request for feedback on proposed new model to support free speech and protest Inbox</title><summary>To help our campus do better in the future, we invite the campus community to provide feedback on the Support Structures for Free Speech and Lawful Protest Proposal. </summary><start-date>1634281200000</start-date><display-name>Request for feedback on proposed new model to support free speech and protest Inbox</display-name><path>/2021/10/new-model-for-free-speech</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/new-model-for-free-speech</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634318039781</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634318039781</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write to you today to apologize. I regret the impact the large police presence in February 2020 had on our students and community, and especially that we lacked more mechanisms for listening, productive dialog and understanding our differences to help avoid that kind of impasse. Students have told me that they did not feel the decisions made during the February protests were intended to keep them safe. I recognize that for many, these events broke trust in our community. I know we will continue working through these experiences throughout the year as our campus returns to in-person instruction and work.</p>
<p>To help our campus do better in the future, I invite the campus community to provide feedback on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/free_speech_proposal/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634403921521000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTZR0P5DGkCgWkGhRNj0Np6wP08w" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/free_speech_proposal/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Support Structures for Free Speech and Lawful Protest Proposal</a>. The proposal reflects the cross-section of feedback we have received and operationalizes the call for a more community-centered approach. The proposal includes four groups that will have responsibilities for supporting students&#8217; First Amendment activities and describes how these changes will build upon our past structure by improving transparency, opportunities for listening, and broadening campus engagement. Over the course of the fall quarter, we are consulting with a wide range of campus stakeholders and will utilize this feedback to improve the proposed structure and processes. Every campus community member is invited to provide feedback directly through the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_das0hscn4xfYdyS&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634403921521000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExVhVNqsDZHd092zBLDMdoPf-3MQ" href="https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_das0hscn4xfYdyS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">linked survey which can be completed anonymously</a>.</p>
<p>During this transitional period, the structures that currently support protest activities, the Emergency Management Policy group (EMPG) and Demonstration Operations Team (DOT), will remain in place. The consultation period will conclude on December 10, 2021, the last day of fall quarter. Please submit all feedback to the linked form by that date. Updates to the proposal reflecting the feedback received will be shared in early January 2022 along with a timeline for transitioning to the new structure.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Campus Safety Community Advisory Board, ably led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Equity and Equal Protection Isabel Dees and Oakes College Provost and Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Marcia Ochoa, and the Graduate Student Association officers and graduate students who participated in listening sessions with campus leaders for <a

Santa Cruz Cowell Ranch Hay Barn for a special Fall Breakfast. Like so many other events, the annual Fall Breakfast had been previously interrupted or postponed for the last two years, due to the pandemic and power outages. This year&#8217;s ceremony was a celebration of hope in the wake of many crises.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a renewed sense of wonder and excitement this academic year,&#8221; said Dean Katharyne Mitchell. &#8220;It was delightful to be able to gather in person once again. The solidarity and tenacity this division has shown is inspiring.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The division presented several major awards recognizing outstanding accomplishments by faculty, staff, researchers, and emeriti faculty. It was noted that selecting recipients for the 2020-21 year was particularly difficult, given the extraordinary nature of the past year and the many contributions that all of the staff and faculty made to ensure the ongoing success of the division and the campus as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards presented included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Golden Apple Teaching Award: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liz Beaumont, an associate professor of politics and program director of legal studies, was recognized for her dedication to student success. Beaumont has demonstrated a particular commitment to teaching and mentoring undergraduate students in capstone work. In addition, she has served on 11 dissertation committees&#8212;acting as the primary advisor for two of those&#8212;and during the past two years, she has shepherded five students through to completion of doctoral degrees. Additionally, it was noted that she continually strives to make her classes even more engaging and effective and to better challenge and support her students in their growth.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Campbell Leaper was recognized this year for outstanding contributions in the field of psychology. Leaper is a renowned scholar in the psychology of gender, whose interdisciplinary, multi-method approach builds on theory and research in the developmental and social psychology of gender and sexism during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. He has studied topics of pressing social import related to gender inequalities in society, revealing the way in which such inequalities often have their basis in how society constructs and maintains traditional gender divisions.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Outstanding Staff Award: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Lawrence, Sociology Department Manager, was recognized as the recipient of this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award. Jessica was acknowledged for her leadership and creative problem solving, support for department staff, her valuable assistance in managing numerous sociology searches, and her time served as chair of the Executive Board of the Administrative Management Professionals on campus.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Award: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craig Reinarman, professor emeritus of sociology, was honored for his profound impact on the shifting discourse and public opinion surrounding drug policy, including the move toward the legalization of cannabis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sociologist with over 26 years of experience in researching, writing, and teaching about law, crime, social justice, drugs and addiction in society, and political sociology, Reinarman&#8217;s work has focused on the political, public policy, and sociological issues surrounding crack/cocaine in the United States, as well as the way crack cocaine has been presented in the media and political discourse.

<p>Ramirez-Ruiz was recognized &#8220;for innovations in mentoring, such as the Lamat Program, all of which have demonstrated how members of historically marginalized populations can thrive, lead, and advance scientific enterprise in astronomy and related fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy at UCSC, established the <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/">Lamat</a> program to give undergraduate students the opportunity to work with UCSC faculty and graduate students on computational astrophysics projects. As the director of the program, he works vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the Lamat program&#8217;s participants belong to historically marginalized groups in STEM, and two-thirds are first-generation college students. All of the program&#8217;s participants have graduated with STEM degrees, and 74 percent have gone on to graduate school.</p>
<p>The Nicholson Medal was established in 1994 by the Division of Plasma Physics and the Forum on Physics and Society. Previous winners include Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium. The award includes a stipend of $2,000, and Ramirez-Ruiz will be honored in an awards ceremony at an upcoming meeting of the American Physical Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/sacnas-award.html</url><title>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz wins SACNAS Distinguished Mentor Award</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="86265c8c807270466cc00b00b3f8342f"><name>equity-compensation-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Equity Compensation Program for Non-represented Staff - Employee Action Request and Funding Pause</title><summary>On September 14, 2021 Chancellor Larive announced a 3-year program to increase salary levels for non-represented staff that are low relative to market.</summary><start-date>1634281200000</start-date><display-name>Equity Compensation Program for Non-represented Staff - Employee Action Request and Funding Pause</display-name><path>/2021/10/equity-compensation-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/equity-compensation-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634338233464</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634338233464</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Subject: Equity Compensation Program for Non-represented Staff - Employee Action Request and Funding Pause</p>
<p>On September 14, 2021 Chancellor Larive <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/compensation-for-non-represented-staff.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634423777295000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6EXg6w5DIq9oIbmj3di6WXdcm-w" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/compensation-for-non-represented-staff.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced a 3-year program</a> to increase salary levels for non-represented staff that are low relative to market. The first phase of this compensation equity program is intended to provide salary adjustments to affected employees effective December 26, 2021 for biweekly-paid employees and January 1, 2022 for monthly-paid employees.</p>
<p>In order to determine eligible employees and levels of adjustment, a snapshot of data will be pulled from UCPath.</p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE IN TWO KEY AREAS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Complete all actions in UCPath prior to the pause window so the snapshot data is accurate.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Review and update funding entry records to ensure the budget will be allocated to appropriate units.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to your assistance, the Compensation team and Financial Affairs department will need to implement a pause for non-represented Employee Action Requests (EAR) and funding entry updates.</p>
<p><strong>EMPLOYEE ACTION REQUEST PAUSE<br/></strong>Any equity and classification review requests for <span><strong>non-represented</strong></span> staff must be submitted prior to November 1, 2021 to be captured in the snapshot. Due to the workload associated with implementation of this equity program, requests that are not submitted prior to November 1, 2021, should be submitted on or after January 17, 2022. Therefore, we are requesting units to suspend the aforementioned actions for non-represented staff from November 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.</p>
<p>Equity and classification review requests for non-represented staff submitted before November 1, 2021, should not have effective dates after November 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Equity and classification review requests for non-represented staff submitted after January 17, 2022, should not have retroactive effective dates that are prior to the effective dates of the equity program, which are December 26, 2021 for biweekly-paid employees and January 1, 2022, for monthly-paid employees.</p>
<p>Equity and classification review requests for <strong>represented employees</strong> can be submitted during the pause window.</p>
<p>Stipend requests for <strong>all</strong> employees can be submitted during the pause window.</p>
<p>This pause does not affect the Position Control Request process for recruitments.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the EAR pause, please contact <a href="mailto:compensation@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compensation@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING ENTRY CLEANUP BEFORE PAUSE<br/></strong>The Chancellor has committed $2.5 million to be allocated across campus divisions to help bridge the costs of the salary increases.</p>
<p>To maximize central funding support for the equity program divisions are advised to ensure UCPath Funding Entry data is valid and up-to-date for all non-represented staff. Divisions are encouraged to:</p>
<p>Plan ahead for needed Position or Job record changes (e.g. Dept ID) requiring a corresponding change in Funding Entry. Allow sufficient time for SHR to update Job records, and the division/unit to modify and approve Funding Entry by 5pm on November 17, 2021.</p>
<p>Frequently review InfoView&#8217;s &#8216;UCPath All Employees-Unit Roster&#8217; report leading up to the November 17, 2021 deadline. The Unit Roster report must be executed using solely the &#8216;Enter Dept Id&#8217; filter to capture all forms of problematic &#8216;Unfunded&#8217; and &#8216;Suspense&#8217; employee Funding Entry records. Use of any chart, or FOAPAL, related filters will prevent potential existing problems from being revealed.</p>
<p>Resolve problematic &#8216;Unfunded&#8217; and &#8216;Suspense&#8217; records via approved Funding Entry modifications by November 17, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING ENTRY PAUSE<br/></strong>We are requesting units to suspend UCPath Funding Entry page updates and approvals for non-represented staff from November 18, 2021 to November 23, 2021. Funding Entry page updates made during this window could negatively impact equity compensation program adjustments or budget allocation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cider.sites.ucsc.edu/">CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research</a> (CIDER) aims to support research and industry growth by bringing together diverse students, researchers, and industry partners from a variety of sectors, helping fuel research and innovation and develop a diverse drone workforce. The initiative includes a mentorship program for undergraduate students to provide career-enhancing experiential learning opportunities, hands-on field research, flight time, and FAA licensure.</p>
<p>The proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV&#8217;s) or aerial drones for research and commercial uses has dramatically increased over the past 10 years. As aerial drones become more affordable and the technology matures, the application of drones is expanding across many professional fields, which require trained, licensed pilots to conduct these flights.</p>
<p>With the global drone economy predicted to increase from $15 billion to $90 billion by 2030 (<a href="https://levitatecap.com/levitate/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/White-Paper-v4.pdf">Levitate Capital 2020</a>), the demand for skills applicable in the drone industry will only grow. Aerial drones have applications in nearly every field of study at UCSC, including, but not limited to, surveys of coastal and terrestrial ecosystems and animal populations; data capture of remote archaeological sites and support for sociological fieldwork; cinematography; drone development, autonomous navigation systems, and other new technology development; and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing.</p>
<p>The incoming director of CIDER, Becca Fenwick, brings over 10 years of experience using UAVs for a range of research applications. She previously served as director of environmental IT for the <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">UC Natural Reserve System</a> (UCNRS).</p>
<p>The incoming associate director, Justin Cummings, has spent the past two years flying drones with Fenwick as part of the California Heartbeat Initiative, a $2.2-million, 4-year project to map and measure water resources on UCNRS properties around the state. Cummings previously served as the founding director of the UCSC <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars</a> program, whose mission is to grow diverse leadership to strengthen conservation.</p>
<p>As part of the initial launch of CIDER, the extramural Pilot in Training (PIT) mentorship program is being offered to undergraduate students interested in working with drones, with an emphasis on targeting students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM. In late November, 20 students will be selected to participate in this nine-week program, which will meet two days per week for two hours per day during Winter Quarter 2022.</p>
<p>Students will learn how to fly drones, do photogrammetry, use software to create maps, study to earn their FAA part 107 license, and process imagery in GIS, among many other activities. To ensure all students are able to participate, those selected will receive a $600 stipend for participating in the program. The program will also cover the costs for students to take their FAA 107 license test. Students who earn their license will be eligible for volunteer and paid opportunities to support campus research and contracts to fly drones and process data.</p>
<p>Applications are available online at <a href="https://cider.sites.ucsc.edu/pilots-in-training-program/">cider.sites.ucsc.edu/pilots-in-training-program</a>. The application deadline is November 5, 2021.</p>
<p>CIDER has five core pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experiential learning for undergraduate and graduate students</li>
<li>Campus research support</li>
<li>Securing commercial contracts</li>
<li>Supporting students traditionally underrepresented in STEM</li>
<li>Industry outreach</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the PIT mentoring program, CIDER staff is also in the process of securing contracts for drone field research with local and state agencies that will provide opportunities for trained students to get paid field experience.</p>
<p>The program is also working to support capstone and independent study opportunities and develop certification programs and course-bearing curriculum with faculty and industry to support workforce development. Additionally, staff are developing relationships with companies to provide internships and employment opportunities for student pilots.</p>
<p>For any students and faculty currently interested in using drones for field research, CIDER staff is available to support their efforts.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5694"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate: From White Supremacy to Governmental Gridlock</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wirls supports these views with extensive historical research and modern-day observation and analysis. The book includes a study of records from the U.S Constitutional Convention and proceedings from all major Senate debates about the filibuster, dating back to before 1917. Wirls also includes insights from interviews with Senate staff across the past decade.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The weight of history should really push us to think about why some of these institutions should be changed,&#8221; Wirls said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the book focuses on two key aspects of the Senate that Wirls believes violate the democratic tenet of &#8220;one person, one vote&#8221; by promoting minority rule. First, a minority of the voting population in the United States can dictate what happens in the Senate, he says, because each state, regardless of population, is allotted two senators. Wirls sees this as a form of relative disenfranchisement for voters in more populous states, which also tend to be more diverse.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Wirls says the minority of elected officials within the Senate can block what the majority wants to do through the filibuster: a type of prolonged debate used to stall or prevent voting on a topic. Wirls argues that the filibuster has become a problem for the entire government, because a minority of senators determined to prevent passage of legislation can ultimately block the policy agendas of both the majority in the House of Representatives and the president.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We find ourselves in a situation where the filibuster is becoming increasingly dysfunctional, and equal representation among states, more than any time in American history, is giving an advantage to one party over the other,&#8221; Wirls said. &#8220;Regardless of which party that benefits, it&#8217;s not a democratic process.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book unpacks many common defenses of these aspects of the Senate, which Wirls argues essentially amount to a &#8220;mythology&#8221; with no strong constitutional foundation. For example, the Senate is often described as having a special role in protecting the interests of political minorities, but the book argues that the Constitutional Convention showed no such intent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our Framers saw it as the system as a whole&#8212;separation of powers and checks and balances&#8212;that prevents tyranny of the majority,&#8221; Wirls explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the Senate in particular that does that. It was never designated that way.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the book presents evidence that dysfunction in the Senate has more often been manipulated as a tool for active suppression of people from racial minority groups, particularly African Americans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The biggest contradiction between the Senate&#8217;s self-image and their actual history is that, in many very important cases, their main role was thwarting, vetoing, and preventing the passage of even moderate legislation that would have helped in terms of civil rights for actual minorities in this country,&#8221; Wirls said. &#8220;And that's consistent throughout a big chunk of the 20th century.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this history, Wirls says reforming the Senate could contribute to transformative change for racial justice and equity. He also believes reform would ultimately help the government function more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But building the political will for these types of reforms is a daunting task, as many failed attempts to abolish the filibuster have demonstrated. The book advocates for continued efforts, including serious consideration of how Senate representation could be reassigned in a way that would maintain a small deliberative body, as the Framers intended, while also ensuring equal power among voters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Wirls hopes his book will help more people to understand why these reform efforts could be important. Without meaningful change, he fears that continued government shortcomings will only produce more frustration and political polarization across the country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When the government looks like it's just hopelessly mired in confusion and polarization and nothing really gets done, people get angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if that goes on long enough, you're really in danger of diminishing or damaging public support for democratic institutions.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASFS will become the UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology, and future communications about the center&#8217;s work will soon begin to reflect this change. The rebranding development took place with input from a 2021 survey of stakeholders. The changes are intended to help reach new audiences as part of the center&#8217;s vision to create an equitable food system that empowers local communities, builds relationships, and nourishes all people and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This will be a thrilling aesthetic change for us, one that was determined by deeply respecting our history, evaluating our current work, and allowing ourselves to dream big about our future,&#8221; said Stacy Philpott, director of the Center for Agroecology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Agroecology will celebrate its 55th anniversary next year, and it remains focused on experiential education, participatory research, agricultural extension, and public service. The center manages what may be the oldest university-based organic farm in the country and supports an agroecology major, as well as an Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture that has trained more than 1,500 emerging leaders.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rooted in the Social Sciences Division, the Center for Agroecology brings a social justice perspective to envision an equitable future for food systems. Food access remains a core pillar of the center&#8217;s work. Campus-grown produce supports the student Basic Needs program, a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, and community produce stands.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center also provides free organic farming guides to support the needs of farmers and has a long history of conducting and collaborating on groundbreaking research in areas like pest and pathogen management, soil health, and no-till farming strategies.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9965e86b807270466cc00b00d1fa7b22"><name>sacnas-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz wins SACNAS Distinguished Mentor Award</title><summary>Ramirez-Ruiz will be honored by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science at the 2021 SACNAS National Diversity in STEM Conference.</summary><start-date>1634626800000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz wins SACNAS Distinguished Mentor Award</display-name><path>/2021/10/sacnas-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/sacnas-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1634661165145</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634664391401</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>104843</file-size><width>350</width><height>451</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20800</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Ramirez-Ruiz will be honored by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science at the 2021 SACNAS National Diversity in STEM Conference</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) has announced that Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will receive the 2021 SACNAS Distinguished Mentor Award.</p>

It is wonderful to see so many of you back on campus and in our classrooms, labs, libraries and gathering spaces. What you&#8217;re reading here is the first of what will be a quarterly communication from me, highlighting academic news from around campus. Keeping our community informed about the programs that are at the core of our mission is my goal, and I hope this information helps us strengthen our community.</p>
<p>Three weeks into the academic year is a good time to step back, take a breath, and appreciate all that we have accomplished in our return to primarily in-person instruction this fall quarter. Nineteen months ago, in the face of an emerging global pandemic, we pivoted in just one week to remote operation. It wasn&#8217;t possible to undertake significant course redesign at that time, but we spent the summer of 2020 supporting instructors to redesign courses, knowing we would likely be remote all last year. Efforts to upright our curriculum, over six remote quarters, were significant, and we should not undervalue this achievement.</p>
<p>Our adoption of new technology and teaching practices continues to benefit our entire community now that we have returned to in-person instruction. I am deeply grateful to Jody Greene and the team at our Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning. CITL led the charge on educating our educators on the latest research and developments in teaching.

<h2>Campus voted into prestigious library association</h2>
<p>Last week, University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell and I shared the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/association-of-research.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634826605185000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEF1bx4ysqKInBecNPZ-hLq6-hvnQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/association-of-research.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news that we had been invited to join the Association of Research Libraries</a> (ARL), a nonprofit organization comprising roughly 125 libraries and archives at major public and private universities, federal government agencies, and large public institutions in North America. It is a great honor; invitations are limited,and they are coveted in the research community.</p>
<p>The initiatives the ARL undertakes on behalf of members will benefit us greatly. ARL affiliates are leading institutions that attract millions of users annually, leaving them uniquely positioned to proactively address the information challenges and opportunities facing the research and learning community. The group fosters the open exchange of ideas and expertise, a practice we wholeheartedly embrace as a research university.</p>
<p>The UCSC University Library punches above its weight class as a research library. It has grown responsively alongside campus, adopting innovative approaches and new information technologies, strengthening our academic and research enterprises through a wide range of information resources. Our library is versatile and innovative, deep in technological expertise, and this honor reflects that. Congratulations to Elizabeth, who is already a leading voice in state and national advocacy efforts on behalf of university libraries. This is a richly deserved honor for her and her team &#8212; and something we should all take great pride in.</p>
<h2>Ramirez-Ruiz honored for innovations in mentoring</h2>
<p>Kudos to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, who was recently chosen as the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/nicholson-medal.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634826605185000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8ctc_5cbyaBLxvLWBvR1iAtTD8g" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/nicholson-medal.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recipient of the American Physical Society&#8217;s 2021 Dwight Nicholson Medal for Outreach</a>. Enrico was recognized for innovations in mentoring that have demonstrated how members of historically marginalized populations can thrive and advance scientific enterprise in astronomy and related fields.</p>
<p>Enrico holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy. He established the Lamat Institute (&#8220;star&#8221; in Mayan) a decade ago to give undergraduates the opportunity to work with faculty and graduate students on computational astrophysics projects. Two-thirds of the program&#8217;s participants belong to historically marginalized groups in STEM, and two-thirds are first-generation college students. All of the program&#8217;s participants have graduated with STEM degrees, and 74 percent have gone on to graduate school.</p>
<p>This honor is well-deserved, and an example of the pioneering efforts being undertaken on our campus to prepare and inspire our students for professional and personal success. Congratulations, Enrico!</p>
<h2>Mellon grant funds inclusion in national Latinx studies initiative</h2>
<p>Our campus learned late this past summer it would be part of a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/crossing-latinidades-grant.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634826605185000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGT689toXYTANC8rcyUR7cneEDbPg" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/crossing-latinidades-grant.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">national initiative in Latinx studies</a> called &#8220;Crossing Latinidades: Emerging Scholars and New Comparative Directions,&#8221; funded through a three-year, $5 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>Led by the University of Illinois Chicago, this initiative involves 16 Hispanic-Serving Institutions that also have R1 designations. A key component of the project will be the creation of a yearly summer institute on Latinx studies as well as a mentorship program that aims to boost the research skills, intellectual curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking of rising scholars. In years two and three of the grant, 10 research working groups will be funded that will include senior and junior Latinx studies scholars as well as graduate students.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful opportunity for our scholars in training to collaborate with experts in the field and with their peers at institutions nationwide, amplifying the importance of Latinx studies, and I&#8217;m grateful for the Mellon support.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Visualizing Abolition&#8217; initiative receives $2 million grant</h2>
<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has also been extremely generous to our campus on another front, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/mellon-visualizing-abolition.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634826605185000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3DeLlQyM52M-vwBSKQ43KkfBvmQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/mellon-visualizing-abolition.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">awarding nearly $2 million to our &#8220;Visualizing Abolition&#8221;</a> initiative, the nation&#8217;s most ambitious and sustained art and prison-abolition effort. It is led by Gina Dent, Associate Professor of Feminist Studies, and Dr. Rachel Nelson, Director of our Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The initiative, first launched in fall 2020 to examine the ways people understand issues of mass incarceration, detention, and policing, aims to foster creative research and to shift the perception of prisons through the use of art and education. The funding will support the development of new work by artists, musicians, humanists, and other researchers. Gina and Rachel&#8217;s collaboration has been a great success to date, and through this funding the initiative will continue to evolve and expand. The Institute of the Arts and Sciences was created with collaborations as a goal, and it&#8217;s wonderful to see the attention &#8220;Visualizing Abolition&#8221; is garnering, with a social justice effort &#8212; something that defines our campus &#8212; at its core.</p>
<h2>Expanding support for graduate students</h2>
<p>To support our graduate students, UC Santa Cruz over the past two years has created <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/enhanced-programs/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634826605185000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4FR6R5iDum6L3VbDZD-QE9cHlmQ" href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/enhanced-programs/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional and enhanced programs</a> focused on housing, student success, and family support. The programs are designed to be responsive to the specific concerns graduate students have raised about the challenges they face living, learning and working in our community. The effort is a good start, and represents an open dialogue and shared problem-solving effort between our graduate students and campus leaders.</p>
<p>Our population of graduate students dipped this past academic year, when COVID-19 impacts were being felt most acutely. This year&#8217;s cohort is back to pre-pandemic enrollment, with 656 total students, 382 of them master&#8217;s candidates, and 274 seeking doctoral degrees.</p>

The result is a complete picture of the death of a red supergiant star when it runs out of fuel, collapses under its own gravity, and explodes in a core-collapse supernova.</p>
<p>"We used to talk about supernova work like we were crime scene investigators, where we would show up after the fact and try to figure out what happened to that star," explained Ryan Foley, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "This is a different situation, because we really know what's going on and we actually see the death in real time."</p>
<p>Foley&#8217;s team reported their findings in a paper published October 21 in the journal <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>
<p>The supernova, called SN 2020fqv, is in the interacting Butterfly Galaxies, which are located about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered in April 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego, California. Astronomers realized that the supernova was simultaneously being observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a NASA satellite designed primarily to discover exoplanets. They quickly trained the Hubble Space Telescope on it as well as a suite of ground-based telescopes, including at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory and at the Keck and Gemini Observatories in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Together, these observatories gave a holistic view of a star in the very earliest stage of destruction. Hubble probed the material very close to the star, called circumstellar material, just hours after the explosion. This material was blown off the star in the last year of its life. These observations allowed astronomers to understand what was happening to the star just before it died.</p>
<p>"We rarely get to examine this very close-in circumstellar material since it is only visible for a very short time and we usually don't start observing a supernova until at least a few days after the explosion," explained first author Samaporn Tinyanont, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC. "For this supernova, we were able make ultra-rapid observations with Hubble, giving unprecedented coverage of the region right next to the star that exploded."</p>
<p>TESS provided an image of the system every 30 minutes starting several days before the explosion through the explosion itself and continuing for several weeks. The team also looked at Hubble observations of the star going back to the 1990s. Hubble was used again starting only hours after astronomers first detected the explosion. And from studying the circumstellar material with Hubble, the scientists gained an understanding of what was happening around the star in the previous decade. By combining all of this information, the team was able to create a multi-decade look at the star's final years.</p>
<p>"Now we have this whole story about what's happening to the star in the years before it died, through the time of death, and then the aftermath of that," said Foley. "This is really the most detailed view of stars like this in their last moments and how they explode."</p>
<p><strong>The Rosetta Stone of Supernovas</strong></p>
<p>Tinyanont and Foley have called SN 2020fqv "the Rosetta Stone of supernovas." The ancient Rosetta Stone, which has the same text inscribed in three different scripts, helped experts learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>In the case of this supernova, the science team used several different methods to determine the mass of the exploding star. These included comparing the properties and the evolution of the supernova with theoretical models; using information from a 1997 archival Hubble image of the star to rule out higher mass stars; and using Keck observations to directly measure the amount of oxygen in the supernova, which probes the mass of the star. The results are all consistent: around 14 to 15 times the mass of the sun. Accurately determining the mass of the star that explodes in a supernova is crucial to understanding how massive stars live and die.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time we've been able to verify the mass with these three different methods for one supernova, and all of them are consistent,&#8221; said Tinyanont. &#8220;Now we can push forward using these different methods and combining them, because there are a lot of other supernovas where we have masses from one method but not another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The findings also indicate that the star had a complicated history of mass loss a few years before core collapse. In the years before stars explode, they tend to become more active. Some astronomers point to the red supergiant Betelgeuse, which has recently been belching significant amounts of material, and they wonder if this star will soon go supernova. While Foley doubts Betelgeuse will imminently explode, he does think we should take such stellar outbursts seriously.</p>
<p>"This could be a warning system," said Foley. "So if you see a star start to shake around a bit, start acting up, then maybe we should pay more attention and really try to understand what's going on there before it explodes. As we find more and more of these supernovas with this sort of excellent data set, we'll be able to understand better what's happening in the last few years of a star's life."</p>
<p>Foley noted that these unique observations of a supernova were carried out during the COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020 and required extraordinary efforts and coordination by a large number of people, mostly working from home. Many observatories were shut down for part of the time, but they reopened soon enough to obtain crucial data for the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fantastic how people worked together to make this happen,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;A lot of people were involved, and it was logistically complicated, but in the end the data we got were amazing.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9fbdb78c807270466cc00b00d155c7dc"><name>flu-vaccination-mandate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC flu vaccination mandate compliance due Nov. 19</title><summary>The University of California issued an  executive order on  Oct. 8, 2021 , requiring flu vaccination for all students, faculty, other academic appointees, and staff who learn, live, or work at a UC location.</summary><start-date>1634713200000</start-date><display-name>UC flu vaccination mandate compliance due Nov. 19</display-name><path>/2021/10/flu-vaccination-mandate</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/flu-vaccination-mandate</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634767583087</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634767583087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><blockquote type="cite">

<p>The study, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1258">published October 13 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, focused on how much the pups weighed when they were weaned (weaning mass), because higher weaning mass increases a pup&#8217;s chance of survival. First author Rachel Holser, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz, said she expected major oceanographic events that affect the abundance and distribution of the seals&#8217; prey to have a big effect. To her surprise, however, other factors turned out to be much more important.</p>
<p>&#8220;The single most important factor in determining the weaning mass of pups was the age of the mother,&#8221; Holser said. &#8220;That was more important than the mother&#8217;s size, which is a measure of her foraging success, and certainly more important than conditions in the ocean. We expected major El Ni&#241;o events and other oceanographic events to have more impact than they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother&#8217;s age is important for several reasons, she noted. One is that older females produce milk with higher fat content at the start of lactation than young females do. But the mother&#8217;s experience is also crucially important. A more experienced female is better able to choose and defend a good location on the beach for rearing her pup, and she is better able to keep her pup from getting lost and wasting its energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she gives birth to this tiny pup, it&#8217;s got four weeks to put on as much fat as it can, which means it needs to spend as much time as possible nursing and resting,&#8221; Holser said.</p>
<p>This gets harder as the population grows and more and more animals are crowded together on the beach. &#8220;When the colony becomes more dense, there are more interactions&#8212;sometimes the females are fighting, or the males will cause a disturbance&#8212;and pups end up getting lost and wasting energy trying to find their mother,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study found that higher population densities led to smaller pups overall, but this effect was more pronounced for younger females than for the older, more experienced ones.</p>
<p>Holser noted that, while it is often assumed that a larger female will have larger pups, the mother&#8217;s age is actually more important than her size. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of variability in size, and the data show that what&#8217;s really important is the experience of having been through multiple reproductive cycles,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ocean conditions&#8212;such as El Ni&#241;o events, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and marine heatwaves&#8212;do matter, she said, but their effects on weaning mass are relatively small compared to other factors. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that it doesn&#8217;t play a role, but it&#8217;s not nearly as important as those onshore conditions&#8212;who your mother is and how dense the colony is,&#8221; Holser said.</p>
<p>This resilience in the face of changing environmental conditions is largely due to the elephant seals&#8217; reproductive strategy. Female elephant seals spend months at sea traveling vast distances across the North Pacific Ocean to feed and put on weight before returning to the colony to give birth. While nursing their pup, they do not leave the beach to feed, relying on the stored energy acquired during the foraging migration.</p>
<p>Other species, such as the California sea lion, depend on regular feeding forays while they are nursing their pups, so a change in conditions that makes it harder to find prey off the coast can be disastrous.</p>
<p>&#8220;During a major El Ni&#241;o, you can see almost complete reproductive failure in some years for species like sea lions,&#8221; Holser said. &#8220;With elephant seals, we don&#8217;t see that kind of boom and bust effect. Even in a poor year, they manage to be pretty successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cautioned, however, that the effects of ocean conditions on elephant seals can be seen in some measures of the population&#8217;s health other than weaning mass. In bad years, some females will skip breeding entirely to restore their body condition rather than rearing a pup. There may also be a decrease in the survival rate of adult females.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous work has shown that ocean conditions impact the ability of the mother to invest in her young, but this study shows that age and, more importantly, experience can compensate for those environmental changes,&#8221; said coauthor Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC. &#8220;As a senior scientist, it&#8217;s good to know that experience matters!&#8221;</p>
<p>Northern elephant seals were hunted to near extinction by the early 1900s, but the population has made a remarkable recovery since the end of commercial sealing. Thousands of pups are now born every year at the breeding colony at <a href="https://anonuevoreserve.ucsc.edu/">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve</a>, part of the UC Natural Reserve System.</p>
<p>The long-running elephant seal research program at UC Santa Cruz has been studying this colony since the 1960s, yielding an invaluable trove of data. Begun by Professor Emeritus Burney Le Boeuf, the program has continued under Costa&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study was only possible because of the work of hundreds of people who have been taking these measurements for over 40 years,&#8221; Holser said.</p>
<p>In addition to Holser and Costa, the coauthors of the paper include Daniel Crocker at Sonoma State University, Patrick Robinson at UC Santa Cruz, and Richard Condit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a3a5673d807270466cc00b00911468c7"><name>emergency-system-test</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Test of community emergency alert system at 10 a.m. today</title><summary>Santa Cruz County emergency response officials are planning a test of the countyâs alert and warning system at 10 a.m. today.</summary><start-date>1634799600000</start-date><display-name>Test of community emergency alert system at 10 a.m. today</display-name><path>/2021/10/emergency-system-test</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/emergency-system-test</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1634833098538</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634833130497</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Santa Cruz County emergency response officials are planning a test of the county&#8217;s alert and warning system at 10 a.m. today.</span></p>

(Image credit: Jessica Kendall-Bar)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>New tools for data visualization can transform data from animal-borne tags into cinematic and informative animations of marine mammal behavior</article-subhead><article-text><p>In her first year as a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Jessica Kendall-Bar began working as a freelance artist and started thinking about how to integrate her art and science more intentionally. Four years later, her work on animations to help scientists communicate their findings has led to the development of a powerful set of tools and procedures for generating realistic, data-driven animations of animal behavior.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/VISAP52981.2021.00007">paper</a> presented at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome">IEEE Visualization Conference</a> (October 24 to 29), Kendall-Bar showed how these animations not only help scientists convey their findings to other scientists and the public, but can also help them make sense of their data.</p>
<p>&#8220;By animating a three-dimensional model with data, we can simultaneously display several different data streams. This makes it easier and faster to recognize important patterns in the data,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For decades, marine mammal researchers have been using increasingly sophisticated tags to track animals and record their movements and diving behavior, capture video, and even record physiological data such as heart rates. Kendall-Bar&#8217;s thesis research explores new techniques for monitoring sleep in wild marine mammals.</p>
<p>In 2019, she offered to do an animation for a researcher whose presentation on humpback whale feeding behavior she had seen at a scientific conference. &#8220;He had a spectacular video of three whales feeding cooperatively at the bottom of the sea, but it was really difficult to see what they were doing,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;The talk generated a huge amount of interest at the conference, with hundreds of people squinting and craning their necks to decipher what was happening in the video.&#8221;</p>
<p>The animation she produced for the whale researcher, NOAA scientist David Wiley at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, not only shows the humpback feeding behavior more clearly than the video did, it also includes a simulated school of prey fish with scientifically accurate behavior, and shows how ropeless technology for lobster traps can reduce the risk of whale entanglements.</p>
<p>Subsequent projects have grown increasingly sophisticated in their use of data-driven animations. Working with Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, Kendall-Bar developed an animation showing how activity patterns in female elephant seals changed in the course of their seven-month foraging trip (see <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/elephant-seal-migration.html">&#8216;lightscapes of fear&#8217;</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;As we drafted our manuscript, Jessie's artistic skills helped us see our dataset from an entirely new perspective,&#8221; said Beltran, noting that the animation helped propel the paper into the public eye, with over 100,000 views on Twitter. &#8220;In the era of big data, we need more crossover between art and science. The art can inform the science, and the science can inform the art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another elephant seal video was developed with Gitte McDonald at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and Daniel Costa, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC. This 3D animation visualizes the swimming behavior and heart rate of a seal as it dives, demonstrating the fear response caused by the sound of a killer whale, an important elephant seal predator.</p>
<p>The fourth animation described in the paper is based on narwhal research led by Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. It shows the swimming behavior and heart rate of a narwhal after release from net entanglement in East Greenland and highlights the narwhal&#8217;s paradoxical fear response involving a very low heart rate during rapid swimming strokes (see &#8216;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/narwhals.html">Heart monitors on wild narwhals reveal alarming responses to stress</a>&#8217;).</p>
<p>&#8220;In these four projects, we integrated the data into narrated animations designed to reach particular audiences, including other scientists as well as educating the public or policy makers and people who might help achieve a conservation outcome,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said.</p>
<p>In addition to the marine mammal researchers, the collaborations also involved Angus Forbes, associate professor of computational media in the Baskin School of Engineering, who has expertise in data visualization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessica&#8217;s data-driven animations effectively communicate scientific results and provide insight into the many steps involved in achieving those results,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;Her research into new forms of visual communication benefits scientists working on interdisciplinary projects and helps to increase engagement with the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar has created an <a href="https://www.jessiekb.com/artforscicomm">online learning center</a> that provides an open-source code repository and step-by-step tutorials and workshops for scientists interested in using graphic design, animation, and other visual communication tools. She has also helped teach workshops and courses on data visualization at UC Santa Cruz, working with the <a href="http://artsresearch.ucsc.edu/openlab">OpenLab Network</a> and faculty in the Art Department and the Computational Media Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;The film industry has created powerful tools for animation, and we should be taking advantage of those tools for science,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These animations bring together biologists, artists, and computer scientists for interdisciplinary collaborations that advance each field. I think we should be working together more often.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a4ad9948807270466cc00b00c97bb4d2"><name>jwst-launch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>As launch of James Webb Space Telescope nears, astronomers anticipate new era of discoveries</title><summary>UCSC astronomers will be among the first to use the powerful new space telescope, and have been involved in the project from the start.</summary><keywords>Garth Illingworth, Natalie Batalha, Brant Robertson, Jonathan Fortney, Andrew Skemer</keywords><start-date>1635231600000</start-date><display-name>As launch of James Webb Space Telescope nears, astronomers anticipate new era of discoveries</display-name><path>/2021/10/jwst-launch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/jwst-launch</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1634850412849</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635263109612</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/jwst-illustration-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/jwst-illustration-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jwst-illustration-500.jpg</name><display-name>jwst-illustration-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>193222</file-size><width>500</width><height>423</height></image><image-alt>JWST illustration</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/mirror-test-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/mirror-test-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mirror-test-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mirror-test-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26697</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>JWST mirror</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An illustration of the James Webb Space Telescope after its deployment in orbit.

The $10 billion infrared telescope will complement and extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, providing greater sensitivity with its much larger primary mirror and capturing longer wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>&#8220;JWST is so much more powerful than our best current telescopes&#8212;100 times Hubble&#8212;it&#8217;s going to impact every area of astronomy, just like Hubble did,&#8221; said Garth Illingworth, a distinguished professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;And when you look at the UCSC astronomy group, there&#8217;s no doubt we are well positioned to play a major role in this mission, as we&#8217;ve done with Hubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Illingworth himself has been a key player in JWST&#8217;s long journey from concept to completion&#8212;leading initial planning studies, chairing important advisory committees such as the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/about/history/jwst-advisory-committee-jstac">JWST Science Advisory Committee (JSTAC)</a>, which he chaired for 8 years, and most recently serving as an external advisor on JWST to the director of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. JSTAC played a key role in maximizing the science return from JWST by, for example, defining the Early Release Science program, which gives astronomers quick access to fully open, public data, as well as advising NASA on the resources needed to fund JWST&#8217;s science programs.</p>
<p>Seeing the telescope as it underwent final tests before being shipped to the launch site, Illingworth couldn&#8217;t help but think back to his work more than three decades ago on what was then called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). At the time, he was deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), and Hubble had not even been launched yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little unbelievable to see it finished,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although the details of the implementation are very different, the core features of the concept we came up with in 1987 is basically what we&#8217;re flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>JWST will probe the earliest, most distant galaxies in the universe, peer into stellar nurseries shrouded in dust, and observe faint planets orbiting nearby stars, opening new windows for exploring every phase of cosmic history.</p>
<p>The telescope&#8217;s 21-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror enables it to gather more light from faint objects than Hubble&#8217;s 8-foot (2.4-meter) mirror, and its infrared vision, capturing wavelengths longer than visible light but shorter than radio waves, gives it unprecedented powers. Ultraviolet and visible light emitted by the first stars more than 13 billion years ago has been stretched by the expansion of the universe and is reaching us today as infrared light. Infrared light also penetrates the clouds of gas and dust in which stars and planets form.</p>
<h2>Other worlds</h2>
<p>UCSC astronomers will be involved in projects within each of the four main science themes JWST will study (first stars and galaxies, galaxies over time, lifecycle of stars, and planetary systems). A large group of UCSC astronomers is studying planets around other stars (exoplanets), one of the most exciting areas in which JWST is expected to open new territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be transformational,&#8221; said Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the <a href="https://owl.ucsc.edu/">Other Worlds Laboratory</a> at UCSC. &#8220;JWST will revolutionize the field in terms of telling us about the atmospheres of exoplanets in a way we haven&#8217;t been able to do before. Hubble is great, but it was never designed to get spectra of exoplanets.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spectrum shows the wavelengths of light from an object and can be used to identify the molecules present in a planet&#8217;s atmosphere. Infrared spectra from JWST&#8217;s instruments will reveal the chemical fingerprints of exoplanet atmospheres. &#8220;Infrared is good for seeing things like water, methane, ammonia&#8212;really common molecules in our solar system that we will now be able to see in other planetary systems,&#8221; Fortney said.</p>
<p>UCSC astronomers will be leading the first observations of exoplanets with JWST through the Early Release Science (ERS) program.</p>
<h2>Exoplanet hub</h2>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on the threshold of a new decade of exoplanet observations that will be characterized by the study of their atmospheres, and UCSC is a hub for atmospheric exoplanet science,&#8221; said Natalie Batalha, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and principal investigator of an ERS program to study transiting exoplanets.</p>
<p>A transiting exoplanet is one that passes in front of its host star, allowing astronomers to analyze light filtered through the planet&#8217;s atmosphere. Direct imaging of exoplanets is the focus of another ERS program co-led by Associate Professor Andrew Skemer.</p>
<p>Skemer explained that the ERS programs are intended to give the astronomy community a quick assessment of the performance of the telescope&#8217;s instruments in each of their specific observation modes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exoplanet observations are unusual compared to other JWST observations. For transits you need very precise time series, and for direct imaging you have to subtract the glare of the star so you can see the faint planet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s never been a telescope like JWST before, so figuring out how to do this optimally is very important, and we want to get these important datasets into the hands of the community as soon as possible. In the process, we&#8217;ll be doing some interesting science.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the ERS programs, UCSC astronomers will be involved in a broad range of projects in JWST&#8217;s Cycle 1 programs, including several major exoplanet studies. Batalha said she is particularly excited to learn more about the abundant &#8220;super-Earths&#8221; found by NASA&#8217;s Kepler Mission, for which she was project scientist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kepler taught us that the diversity of exoplanets far exceeds the diversity in our own solar system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The most common type of exoplanets are these super-Earths or sub-Neptunes that are intermediate in size between terrestrial planets and giant planets. We need to understand what those planets are like, because that has significant implications for understanding the propensity for life in the galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batalha, who leads a NASA <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/astrobiology-consortium.html">Interdisciplinary Consortium for Astrobiology Research</a>, will also be collaborating with Natasha Batalha at NASA Ames Research Center, the principal investigator of the largest exoplanet program in Cycle 1 (and Natalie&#8217;s daughter). Fortney, Skemer, and Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral scholar working with both Batalha and Skemer, will be leading several other exoplanet projects, including a search for newly formed planets lurking in the disks of protoplanetary material observed around some stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be James Webb exoplanet central here,&#8221; Skemer said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just the exoplanet research.&#8221;</p>
<h2>First galaxies</h2>
<p>UCSC astronomers are also key players in investigations of the earliest galaxies. Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Brant Robertson is involved in several major programs using JWST to map the distribution of galaxies in the early universe and study how the first galaxies formed and evolved over time. With its infrared vision and large mirror, JWST will be a powerful time machine, peering deeper into the universe and further back in time than ever before possible.</p>
<p>Robertson serves on the steering committee for the largest single program in Cycle 1, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a collaboration between two instrument teams that will use about 800 hours of observing time. As part of the Guaranteed Time Observations program, the JADES collaboration will retain the data for an initial exclusive access period.</p>
<p>&#8220;JADES is designed so we can take deep images to find the most distant galaxies, and then follow up by taking spectra of those galaxies, which will allow us to pinpoint their ages and measure all kinds of amazing properties, such as how fast they are making stars and how rich in metals they are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will be able to look at the first population of galaxies in the universe and say what they are and how they came to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robertson is also the lead theorist for the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/cosmos-webb.html">COSMOS-Webb galaxy survey</a>, the largest of the Cycle 1 General Observer Programs, with more than 200 hours of observing time, and is a co-investigator of PRIMER, a major public Treasury Program. Each of these complementary galaxy surveys will make important contributions to understanding the story of how galaxies formed in the early universe. COSMOS covers the widest area but not as deeply as the other surveys, PRIMER is the next biggest in area and goes slightly deeper, and JADES goes even deeper and adds spectroscopy to tease out the properties of the galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re like the tiers of a wedding cake, and we&#8217;ll be learning different things about the galaxy population with each one,&#8221; Robertson said.</p>
<p>Illingworth is involved in &#8220;first galaxies&#8221; projects, too, including serving as the U.S. lead for PRIMER and another international Treasury Program (FRESCO), both of which, like the ERS programs, will provide unrestricted data access. Illingworth&#8217;s team pushed Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope to their limits to capture the most distant galaxies ever observed. Now JWST is poised to go much further and transform our understanding of the earliest galaxies. Illingworth said he expects JWST to yield new discoveries even in its first few days of observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so astonishingly powerful, it will answer a lot of questions about how the first galaxies are growing in the first 1 to 2 percent of the life of the universe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;First galaxies were at the heart of what JWST was conceived to do over 20 years ago. Tackling this incredibly challenging problem is going to be so exciting.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Neutron stars</h2>
<p>Other UCSC faculty leading JWST observations include astrophysicist Ryan Foley, whose team will be using the space telescope for follow-up observations of gravitational wave sources, capturing infrared light from the &#8220;kilonova&#8221; explosion when two neutron stars collide. &#8220;It&#8217;s really an exciting program,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need JWST&#8217;s unique capability to go deeper into the infrared and capture a real picture of what&#8217;s going on in these events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many projects of this size and complexity, JWST was plagued by delays and cost overruns. Illingworth has been in the thick of it in his various roles, responding to funding crises and advising Congress and NASA administrators to help keep the project moving forward. Under-budgeting was at the root of many issues, he said. &#8220;Every project needs to carry large enough reserves so you have money available to fix problems immediately when they arise, because the costs go up so fast whenever there are delays,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Now that the telescope is finally ready for launch, the anticipation is mounting for astronomers at UCSC and throughout the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;In certain fields, JWST is going to blow everything else away,&#8221; Skemer said. &#8220;Some types of observations we will never do from the ground again.&#8221;</p>
<p>JWST is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. The Space Telescope Science Institute will operate the telescope after launch. It will take about a month to get the telescope and its sunshield deployed and settled into its orbit 1 million miles from Earth, and another 5 months to get JWST fully commissioned and operational before it can begin observations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://jwst.nasa.gov/</url><title>James

(Photo by Kat Beheshti)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Restored plots of eelgrass in Elkhorn Slough expanded rapidly, providing improved habitat for fish and invertebrates and other benefits of a healthy ecosystem</article-subhead><article-text><p>As the dominant seagrass species on the U.S. West Coast, eelgrass supports a wide range of ecosystem services and functions, making its preservation and restoration a top priority for the region. Eelgrass restoration has a spotty record of success, however, and studies of restoration sites have rarely assessed the full range of ecosystem functions.</p>
<p>In a new study <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2466">published October 6 in <em>Ecological Applications</em></a>, researchers demonstrated that eelgrass restoration efforts can lead to rapid expansion of restored plots and recovery of ecosystem functions.</p>
<p>The study involved small-scale experimental seagrass restoration efforts in Elkhorn Slough on the Central Coast of California. Researchers transplanted 2,340 shoots of eelgrass from healthy meadows into 117 small plots, and evaluated their success relative to areas without vegetation and natural eelgrass meadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within a few years, most of the ecosystem functions were near or at the level seen in natural eelgrass meadows, suggesting that these habitats can recover pretty quickly if the conditions are right,&#8221; said first author Kathryn Beheshti, who earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2021 and is currently a California Sea Grant Fellow at the Ocean Protection Council&#8217;s Climate Change Program.</p>
<p>The restored plots expanded dramatically, resulting in eelgrass beds covering an area 85 times larger than the initial plots. The restored beds began to resemble the natural meadows in structural features such as canopy height and shoot density, in the richness and abundance of species using the restored habitat, and in water quality. The study assessed a suite of seven ecosystem functions, and the researchers also developed a multifunctionality index to assess the overall functional performance of the restored beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that overall the restored plots are performing higher than unvegetated plots and just slightly below the natural meadows,&#8221; Beheshti said.</p>
<p>The benefits of eelgrass meadows range from coastal protection and sediment stabilization to providing food and shelter for many species of fish and invertebrates. Eelgrass meadows provide crucial nursery habitat for many commercially important species, such as Dungeness crab, California halibut, and Pacific herring, whose juveniles find protection within the dense canopy. By slowing water flow and attenuating waves, eelgrass can act as a storm buffer and can protect developed coastlines from storm surges. Eelgrass meadows also counteract ocean acidification by absorbing carbon dioxide from seawater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seagrass provides a whole suite of ecosystem services that we rely on, including all the recreational uses by folks like birders, kayakers, fishers, and others,&#8221; Beheshti said.</p>
<p>She noted that the California Ocean Protection Council&#8217;s <a href="http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/agenda_items/20200226/OPC-2020-2025-Strategic-Plan-FINAL-20200228.pdf">Strategic Plan to Protect California&#8217;s Coast and Ocean</a> includes a target to preserve the existing, known 15,000 acres of seagrass beds and create an additional 1,000 acres by 2025. In addition, she said, NOAA&#8217;s National Marine Fisheries Service is updating its <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/california-eelgrass-mitigation-policy-and-implementing-guidelines">California Eelgrass Mitigation Policy</a>, which currently calls for &#8220;no net loss of eelgrass habitat function&#8221; but does not require mitigation projects to assess habitat function.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study will be a valuable resource for these ongoing efforts,&#8221; Beheshti said.</p>
<p>In June, Beheshti and Melissa Ward, an environmental scientist at San Diego State University, published a report on eelgrass restoration for the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership (&#8220;<a href="http://honu.psmfc.org/media/PMEP/Eelgrass_Restoration_Synthesis/Documents/PMEP_Beheshti_Ward_2021_EelgrassSynthesisReport.pdf">Eelgrass Restoration on the U.S. West Coast: A Comprehensive Assessment of Restoration Techniques and Their Outcomes</a>&#8221;).</p>
<p>In addition, Beheshti, Ward, and Brent Hughes at Sonoma State University, a coauthor of the new paper, are working on a tutorial video about seagrass restoration techniques funded by the Anthropocene Institute. Beheshti said their assessments of past restoration efforts have identified site conditions as the primary driver of success.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the site has poor water quality or is prone to erosion or sediment deposition, those are the main predictors of success or failure,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At Elkhorn Slough, the natural eelgrass meadows were also expanding at the same time as our restoration project, so the conditions were primed for success. At this point we can only speculate, but we&#8217;d like to explore in a more quantitative way why the restoration was so successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Beheshti and Hughes, the coauthors of the paper include Susan Williams at UC Davis, Katharyn Boyer at San Francisco State University, Charlie Endris at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Annakate Clemons at UC Santa Cruz, Tracy Grimes at San Diego State University, and Kerstin Wasson at UCSC and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. This work was supported in part by grants from the Ocean Foundation and the Anthropocene Institute.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a930fa2c807270466cc00b002497483b"><name>blue-pioneers-accelerator</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Emerging ocean conservation leaders set to visit UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>The Blue Pioneers Program (BPP) Accelerator recently announced its 2021 cohort of international ocean conservation professionals who will visit UC Santa Cruzâs Coastal Science Campus.</summary><start-date>1634886000000</start-date><path>/2021/10/blue-pioneers-accelerator</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/blue-pioneers-accelerator</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1634926131733</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1634926131733</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/bpp-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/bpp-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bpp-250.jpg</name><display-name>bpp-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>39676</file-size><width>250</width><height>141</height></image><image-alt>BPP accelerator logo showing an illustrated wave</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Pioneers Program (BPP) Accelerator recently announced its </span><a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/bluepioneers/2021/2021?authuser=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 cohort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of international ocean conservation professionals who will visit UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Coastal Science Campus as part of an eight-week leadership development training program taking place over a span of five months.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://bluepioneers.ucsc.edu/what-we-do"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPP Accelerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hosted by UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CSP), recruits participants from around the globe&#8212;with a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region&#8212;and equips them to address complex challenges through systems thinking and design thinking, collaborative problem solving, and rapid solution development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 30 participants in this year&#8217;s program are mainly early-to mid-career innovators, entrepreneurs, and NGO leaders. Their work intersects the fields of ocean conservation, sustainable food systems, climate change, renewable energy, gender equity, rights of indigenous peoples, and racial justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants will begin their online learning through the program in November. Then, in March, they&#8217;ll travel to UCSC to wrap up their experience with ten days of in-person classes, field trips, and networking events in Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley, and surrounding areas. Shiyu Rachel Wang, assistant director of the program, said that the opportunity to visit UC Santa Cruz is often a draw for participants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program&#8217;s goal is to train global leaders, and when we think about the best places to do that, Santa Cruz is definitely state-of-the-art in coastal conservation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This region of coastal California is among the most advanced in the world for technology, policy, and science in ocean conservation, and UCSC is a leading force in that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff from UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies collaborate to deliver curriculum throughout the program, alongside executives from social impact organizations. The BPP Accelerator originally launched in 2017 at Middlebury Institute, as part of a larger suite of longstanding global programs initiated by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and Paradise Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the BPP Accelerator moved to UC Santa Cruz, and it&#8217;s currently operating with more than $1 million in grant funding from the Packard Foundation. Yuwei Shi, academic director for the BPP Accelerator and a visiting professor in UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program, says the move to UC Santa Cruz has helped the program grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beautiful Coastal Science Campus is such a natural fit in terms of physical infrastructure, and the Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program has amazing faculty, staff, and students&#8221; he said. &#8220;UCSC offers a strong network of relationships.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since coming to UC Santa Cruz, the BPP Accelerator has also been able to launch a new </span><a href="https://bluepioneers.ucsc.edu/news"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement experimental marine conservation projects developed collaboratively by participants. Overall, the program&#8217;s focus on real-world, experiential, project-based learning is an aspect it shares with UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program. That&#8217;s part of what made the hosting arrangement a good fit, along with the global outlook of both programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, program leaders want to build and leverage new partnerships between BPP Accelerator participants and UCSC faculty, students, and staff. Anne Kapuscinski, Director of the Coastal Science and Policy program, said that &#8220;the BPP Accelerator is an exciting part of CSP becoming an innovation hub for practical solutions.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oceans and coastal communities everywhere need help now,&#8221; she added. &#8220;This partnership between CSP and the BPP Accelerator enhances our similar missions to recruit, train, and seed the world with entrepreneurial and diverse leaders in coastal and ocean sustainability.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a97cbf24807270466cc00b004f086518"><name>dybdahl</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In memory: Yolanda Dybdahl</title><summary>The community leader served as a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee during a period of significant change</summary><start-date>1634931000000</start-date><display-name>In memory: Yolanda Dybdahl </display-name><path>/2021/10/dybdahl</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/dybdahl</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1634931097360</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635193799136</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

She was 96.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Yolanda and her husband, Chris Dybdahl, M.D., were involved with UC Santa Cruz beginning with its establishment when they became members of UCSC Affiliates. As a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, Yolanda Dybdahl helped oversee the University's fundraising from 1997 to 2007. In that period the campus significantly expanded support from donors and established 10 new academic chairs endowed by private gifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dybdahl's other community work included the Dominican Hospital Advisory Board and Dominican Hospital Foundation Board on which she served for 32 years. She was instrumental in the hospital's development of Dominican Oaks, a retirement community inspired by a similar project in Santa Rosa that has been led by a close friend. As a volunteer in Dominican Hospital Auxiliary she logged over 20,000 hours. In 1973 Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce named her Woman of the Year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dybdahl was born Yolanda Addeman. She grew up in El Paso, Texas on a property owned by her grandparents, who had emigrated with her parents from Hidalgo Del Parral, Chihuahua, Mexico. Her first language was Spanish. She met Chris when she was 21 at her first volunteer job teaching Spanish at William Beaumont Army Hospital.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Providing affordable, stable, and robust child care is critical for our campus community. In order to focus on our work&#8212;whether studying, teaching, research, or the business of UC Santa Cruz&#8212;we must feel confident that our children are in a good environment with people who will support their development and education.&#160;</p>
<p>After hearing from critical stakeholders in our campus community, I write to share my decision to have UC Santa Cruz continue providing in-house childcare services once the new center is built. An outside provider will not operate Early Education Services at the new facility when it opens.&#160;</p>
<p>Enhancing and expanding our childcare service remains a top priority. The listening sessions in spring&#160; and fall 2021 provided us all with an opportunity to hear from critical stakeholders, including the parents served by EES and the EES staff. I heard a strong preference to continue providing early childhood education in-house and support for the new program and curriculum that we&#8217;ve been developing.&#160;</p>
<p>We are still planning to expand Early Education Services so that we can offer faculty and staff child-care support that is currently available only to students with children. Student Housing West, which is being held up by lawsuits, will eventually enable UC Santa Cruz to build a new childcare facility next to the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge drives. This facility will have the space to serve 140 children, ranging from infants to school age. We anticipate hiring additional staff to support the program&#8217;s expansion once construction is well underway on the new facility.&#160;</p>
<p>To provide additional support to families, UC Santa Cruz will continue providing subsidized <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635042265470000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLB1hrFsZhx4JJlZu7bBOoJ2KIcQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>back-up care for employees and students</span></a> through a contract with Bright Horizons. This includes both in-home care and care at one of the child-care centers that will be in a care network now being assembled.</p>
<p>I appreciate our community&#8217;s commitment to our Early Education Services program and its valuable perspective on ensuring we have a program that is best for our campus and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;the children it serves.&#160;</p>

The deadline to apply is </span><span>November 5th, 2021</span><span>.&#160; If you are interested in the program, please read more below and click a link at the bottom to apply!&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you have any questions or concerns, email </span><a href="mailto:staffadv@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>staffadv@ucsc.edu</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>UCSC Mentorship Concept</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The UCSC SAB Staff Mentorship Program is a volunteer program that pairs experienced UCSC staff from all campus units with newer staff who are seeking to develop themselves professionally. The program provides a supportive structure in which participants can cultivate contacts, explore challenges, and enhance effectiveness as they design their personal growth and career paths.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Once pairs are set, mentors and mentees will define the shape and scope of their personal experience. Some pairs may choose more reading suggestions, for example, where others may choose to rely exclusively on dialogue. The mentor relationship will officially run for one calendar year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Program Cycles</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Staff Mentorship Program cycle runs 12 months. The next program cycle will run the calendar year from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Who Can Participate</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program encompasses UCSC employees who are policy governed by Professional and Support Staff (PSS) and Managers and Senior Professionals (MSP).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mentors are experienced UCSC career employees and well-respected advisors, coaches and colleagues that guide and challenge, and who are willing to share their experiences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mentees are UCSC career employees interested in career development and who have relatively fewer years of service.&#160;</span></p>
<strong>Eligibility requirements for 2022 program participants include:<br/></strong>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Non-represented staff in exempt and non-exempt (report time hourly) payroll titles governed by the Professional and Support Staff (PSS) or Manager and Senior Professional (MSP) policies</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Supervisor approval</span></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Mentees accepted for the program will be sent a list of 3 potential mentors; mentees are expected to arrange brief meetings (in person, virtual, or phone) with potential mentors. After the meeting, mentees and mentors will separately submit their match preferences in ranked order to the UCSC Staff Advisory Board Mentorship Committee. The committee will complete the matching process.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Once matching is completed, pairs will be notified and the mentoring process will begin January 1st, 2022.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>The UCSC Staff Advisory Board will sponsor a networking event to launch the Mentorship Program cycle, at which time mentors and mentees can meet in an informal setting. Mentees and mentors will receive the date, time and location of this 'Program Kick-Off Reception' via email. (Location TBD)</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Once matched, the mentor and the mentee establish mutually agreeable terms for the mentorship relationship. Mentors and mentees meet together on an established schedule for one calendar/fiscal year.</span></p>

Schneider</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his latest book, Assistant Professor of Anthropology Tsim Schneider examines the history of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples in California from an Indigenous perspective, uncovering stories of resilience and continued connection to culture and homelands from the 18th through 20th century, despite multiple waves of colonial intrusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider, who is a citizen of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, has worked with his tribal community for more than 20 years to gather and interpret archival and archaeological evidence in new ways that combat the erasure of Indigenous peoples from historical narratives. </span><a href="https://uapress.arizona.edu/book/the-archaeology-of-refuge-and-recourse"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Archaeology of Refuge and Recourse: Coast Miwok Resilience and Indigenous Hinterlands in Colonial California</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares these findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many anthropologists wrote off my culture a long time ago as being either extinct or on the verge of extinction because of the traumas of the mission period and the late 19th century, but we are still here, and we&#8217;ve been here all along,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;This book is an opportunity, as an archaeologist and anthropologist, to try to write my family and our culture and history back into existence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Archaeology of Refuge and Recourse </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reconstructs histories of Bay Area Indigenous peoples partly through clues found across six archaeological sites within what is now China Camp State Park and Toms Point Preserve. Schneider and his collaborators centered Indigenous knowledge to guide where they looked, what they looked for, and how to interpret what they found. In that process, they documented what prior Euro-centric archeological research methods had overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider says archaeologists are often trained to look for introduced materials&#8212;like glass, metal, and pottery&#8212;to answer questions about Native people after contact with Euro-American colonizers when, in fact, many important Indigenous cultural phenomena continued to incorporate natural materials that don&#8217;t leave the same physical traces. He also argues that archaeologists have misinterpreted artifacts found outside of missions as being prehistoric, rather than evidence of cultural resilience, perhaps due in part to prominent narratives about the extinction of Native cultures during the mission period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we had a chance at China Camp State Park and Toms Point Preserve to bring a new understanding to the long-term occupational histories of these places through viewing the material assemblages differently,&#8221; Schneider explained.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At China Camp State Park, the historical site of several Coast Miwok villages, Schneider and his collaborators examined a series of traditional shell mounds and found evidence that these sites had continued to be in use throughout the mission period. The findings offered what Schneider calls &#8220;a more fine-grained picture&#8221; of Indigenous resistance during this time in history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People were running away from missions and seeking refuge in homelands that were still relevant to them, and they were going back to these places to hunt and gather, to hold dances, and to meet up with friends and family,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These are all ongoing processes that were taking place within Native communities, even while they were being oppressed by colonial institutions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider also examined a series of sites around Toms Point to gain new insight into the lives of Indigenous peoples after the missions were secularized. Toms Point was home to a 19th-century trading post, established on traditional lands by a white settler who married with a local Coast Miwok family. Schneider said the site&#8217;s history shows how Indigenous people maintained long-term relationships to their homelands, including through selective engagement with colonial projects.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Native families and communities came back together after the mission period to start picking up the pieces of their history and their identity, and they found really creative new ways to persist,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Schneider&#8217;s favorite examples of this concept is a collection of cutting tools found near Toms Point. Some tools had been produced from natural materials, such as obsidian and chert. Other tools were shaped out of dark green bottle-glass shards using similar traditional Indigenous knapping techniques. Schneider says these and other belongings are a demonstration of how Indigenous knowledge and ingenuity have helped to protect and prolong cultural traditions.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To me, it really speaks to a process of resilience, or resisting the imposed structures that are pushing Native people out of the picture by constantly finding ways to reassert identity in these new contexts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Native people have transformed their families and their cultures, but also maintained their traditions, and we're continuing to do that in the present day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Schneider hopes to see more of these types of stories incorporated into how history is taught for future generations, both in classrooms and at heritage sites like China Camp State Park and Toms Point Preserve. He also says continued improvements in the telling of history will require more Indigenous voices in archaeology and anthropology and a push for greater accountability among all practitioners within those fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are elders in my community who still have really strong memories about the often destructive forms of archaeology that were practiced in the mid-20th century and how that excluded Native voices,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;As an archaeologist and a tribal member, one of the best things I can do is to be cautious and proactive in working productively with my tribe and to always remain responsible to my community.&#8221;</span></p>

Lewis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis was a renowned student leader in the civil rights movement who stood against racism with bravery, conviction, and organized action during many pivotal moments that helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Later, Lewis served for 17 terms in the House of Representatives, during which time he became known as &#8220;the conscience of Congress&#8221; for his continued commitment to justice and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced the naming in Washington, D.C., alongside Linda Earley Chastang, who was Lewis&#8217;s chief of staff and serves as the president &amp; CEO of the John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation. The announcement included live interaction with students, staff, and faculty gathered at College Ten. The official dedication of John R. Lewis College at UC Santa Cruz will take place in spring of 2022, after a series of events that will expand upon a campus-wide commitment to social justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a profound honor and a great responsibility for UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Larive said, regarding the naming news. &#8220;Our campus community must strive daily to live up to the legacy of Congressman John R. Lewis and to answer his call to create a more just and fair society. This urgent work of advancing social justice is fundamental to our work as a university and is continued by our alumni throughout their careers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz affiliate with one of 10 residential colleges, each of which focus on different themes, including environmental stewardship, creativity, cultural identity, or in the case of College Ten, social justice and community. College Ten will be the first residential college at UC Santa Cruz to be named in honor of a person of color.</span></p>

<h2 style="line-height: 1.4;">College Ten cultivates change-makers</h2>
<p>College Ten hosts a wide variety of programs that support students in advancing social justice and building community. To learn more about the initiatives highlighted below&#8212;and many others&#8212;<a href="https://collegeten.ucsc.edu/">visit the college&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practical Activism Conference:</strong> This student-organized annual event highlights pathways for change, from voting and civic engagement to nonviolent protest. In 2021, the keynote speaker was renowned educator and social justice activist Dr. Angela Davis, a UCSC distinguished professor emerita. Workshops addressed themes including global youth activism, Black Lives Matter, and the effects of COVID-19 on BIPOC communities.</li>
<li><strong>Transcommunal Peace Making:</strong>In partnership with Barrios Unidos and the Cemanahuac Cultural Group at Soledad Correctional Training Facility, this course brings together undergraduates and incarcerated men to learn with and from each other about peacemaking, solidarity, and unity through difference.</li>
<li><strong>Campus/Community Partnerships</strong>: The Apprenticeship in Community-Engaged Research, or (H)ACER, teaches students how to address injustices through research methods that facilitate the co-creation of knowledge. College Ten also features a volunteer club called PRAXIS and an Alternative Spring Break program in partnership with organizations in Watsonville and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UCSC.</li>
<li><strong>Building Student Leadership and Skills:</strong> The College Ten Social Justice &amp; Community Leadership Certificate is awarded at commencement to students who engaged in consistent and sustained leadership linked to the college&#8217;s theme. Upper-division College Ten students can also apply to teach the college&#8217;s Social Justice Issues Workshop, where students deepen their understanding of social justice, learn how to foster constructive dialogue, and undertake an action project.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a wonderful opportunity to deepen the alignment between our community&#8217;s aspirational and lived values,&#8221; said Interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Jennifer Baszile. &#8220;The endowment that will be created with this naming will allow us to advance the experiential opportunities for students to enact social change-making. Congressman Lewis offers us all an inspiring example of student empowerment and institutional transformation that is certainly worthy of celebration.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bearing Lewis&#8217;s name will be a momentous calling for the faculty, staff, and students of College Ten to work in community in the pursuit of social justice, a principle to which Lewis dedicated his life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This opportunity to name the college for someone as inspirational as John Lewis is deeply humbling, and it comes with a major responsibility,&#8221; said Flora Lu, who is provost of College Ten and College Nine and a professor of environmental studies. &#8220;This will be about doing the hard work, individually and together, to aspire to meet the call of what John Lewis entreated us all to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Ten is the youngest and one of the most diverse of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s residential colleges, and since its founding in 2002, it has been focused on offering programming and courses to help students become change agents for justice and equity. While UCSC undergraduates from any field of study can join College Ten, the college has a formal connection with the Social Sciences Division, which helps to support its work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The naming of John R. Lewis College really advances our driving motivations as a division,&#8221; said Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell. &#8220;John Lewis was passionate about social justice, racial justice, civic engagement, and democracy, and we are too. We strive every day to walk that walk, and this naming will be a very important moment to lift our aspirations even higher.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure the college is positioned to create new programs and scale existing ones that advance those values, a donor-funded endowment will support the college in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future John R. Lewis College will seek new avenues for social justice impact while building upon College Ten&#8217;s strong foundations. The college&#8217;s curriculum and programs were designed from the outset to provide learning opportunities, both inside and outside of the classroom, that empower students with crucial skills, knowledge, and perspective to build a more just and equitable world.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to teach our students what it means to be a social change agent,&#8221; said Sarah Woodside Bury, senior director for college student life at College Ten and College Nine. &#8220;That comes with an understanding of the history and legacy of the hard work of those who have come before us, and it also means students understand that they have their own voice and agency to be the future of that change.&#8221;</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Lewis&#8217;s own path to becoming a change agent began when he was a student at seminary school and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He learned nonviolent civil disobedience from Rev. James M. Lawson, Jr. and helped to organize the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960 with the Nashville Student Movement. The success of those early nonviolent direct action campaigns convinced Lewis of the need to get into what he called &#8220;good trouble, necessary trouble,&#8221; in order to drive change. He lived the rest of his life by that motto.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis was arrested 40 times during the 1960s as he continuously put his life on the line to push for civil rights. In 1961, Lewis was one of the original 13 freedom riders who faced constant violence as they rode buses together in inter-racial groups to enforce the desegregation of interstate travel across the South.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His success in demanding change came not only from his personal courage, but also from his dedication to organizing. Drawing inspiration from Ella J. Baker and others, Lewis was one of the founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and was elected chair of the organization in 1963. In that role, he became one of the &#8220;big six&#8221; civil rights leaders who organized the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famed &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis was 23 years old at the time, and he spoke before a crowd of more than 250,000 to deliver a message of his own about the urgent need for action on civil rights. His words resonated with young people across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We must say, &#8216;Wake up, America! Wake up!&#8217;&#8221; Lewis called. &#8220;For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Professor Emeritus of Sociology John Brown Childs was among the members of the crowd that day, and he said Lewis&#8217;s words left a lasting impression on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For those of us who were young people at the time, he spoke directly to us, and it had a deep impact,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;John Lewis was inspiring to me because he deeply believed in the reality of nonviolence and that, whatever we had to struggle for, the struggle must go on. And he didn't work in isolation; he reached out to the world.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is our hope that, through the naming of the John R. Lewis College, we will inspire a future generation of &#8216;good trouble&#8217;-makers that our country and world deserve. Through such steps, we continue to build upon &#8216;the beloved community&#8217; the Congressman fought so hard to advance.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the leader of SNCC, Lewis played an instrumental role in organizing the Freedom Summer of 1964, which sought to register Black voters across Mississippi. UC Santa Cruz Professor Emeritus of Sociology </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/hardy-frye-memoriam.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardy T. Frye</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who passed away in June, was volunteering for SNCC in Mississippi at the time. At one point, he was arrested and spent several hours in jail alongside John Lewis. Frye </span><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/friends-of-frye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later recalled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the experience &#8220;felt like being in jail with the Lord.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis and Hosea Williams also famously led the first march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. State troopers were waiting at the other end of the bridge and began beating the peaceful demonstrators. The violence of that day shocked the nation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterward, Lewis, who suffered a fractured skull, called on President Johnson to take action. The marches continued, and the movement grew. It became a major turning point that rallied public support for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Lewis&#8217;s work ultimately made essential contributions to the passage of both the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years that followed, he took his struggles for justice inside the halls of government. Lewis served 17 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives for Georgia&#8217;s 5th District, where he remained a constant guardian and advocate for civil rights and voting rights. The proposed John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021&#8212;which seeks to protect and strengthen elements of the 1965 Voting Rights Act&#8212;was named in recognition of Lewis&#8217;s impact.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a legislator, Lewis never lost sight of the value of direct action. He set an example for other elected officials by standing up for what he believed was right. He was arrested in Washington on several occasions, including for protesting against apartheid in South African and genocide in Darfur and advocating for immigration reform. He also led a sit-in in the House of Representatives in an effort to force action on gun-control legislation in the aftermath of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama, who awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 for a lifetime of service, characterized his impact by saying:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Generations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind&#8212;an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis passed away on July 17, 2020, but before his death, he reached out across generations to lend his support to new waves of activism around the Black Lives Matter movement, climate change and environmental justice, and other struggles for the future. Lewis always hoped and believed that today&#8217;s young leaders would carry the fight for liberty forward, in their own way. In his 2017 book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across That Bridge: A Vision for Change and the Future of America</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lewis left behind a message that will resonate long into the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Freedom is the continuous action we all must take,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;And each generation must do its part to create an even more fair, more just society."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Collins, Lewis&#8217;s former chief of staff and a representative of his trust, hopes the students, faculty, and staff of the future John R. Lewis College will play a part in making that vision a reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On behalf of the John R. Lewis family, we are deeply grateful for this distinguished honor and tribute to the legacy of Congressman Lewis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is our hope that, through the naming of the John R. Lewis College, we will inspire a future generation of &#8216;good trouble&#8217;-makers that our country and world deserve. Through such steps, we continue to build upon &#8216;the beloved community&#8217; the Congressman fought so hard to advance." </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bebf8496807270466cc00b0066a4e77a"><name>slug-strong-oct-26</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Slug Strong Update: Be sure to get your flu vaccine</title><summary>Weâre continuing to see a decline in COVID-19 cases, both in our campus community and in Santa Cruz County. </summary><start-date>1635231600000</start-date><display-name>Slug Strong update</display-name><path>/2021/10/slug-strong-oct-26</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/slug-strong-oct-26</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1635287794814</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635287794814</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout fall quarter, interim Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan and Student Health Center Medical Director Elizabeth Miller are providing regular updates about efforts to support the campus community&#8217;s health and well-being.&#160;</span></i></p>

<p>Mascharak's research focuses on the structure and function of enzymes, green chemistry, and designing novel drugs for cancer and other diseases. In recent years, his lab has been studying and synthesizing photoactive compounds that release nitric oxide or carbon monoxide when exposed to light. Since nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are biological signaling molecules with antimicrobial and other properties, there is great potential to use compounds that release them in biomedical therapies.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Mascharak received the the Chemical Research Society of India Medal in 2017, the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Samman Gold Medal in 2014, and the 2015-16 Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Mascharak earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees at the University of Burdwan, India, and his Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2002, a UC Santa Cruz college with the theme of social justice and community opened with distinguished professors, politically engaged students, and a number for a name: College Ten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That changed for good, and for better, this week when College Ten was named for John R. Lewis, the late American civil rights leader and politician who stood up to Jim Crow&#8211;era segregation in the 1960s. He was one of the key organizers of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The son of Alabama sharecroppers, Lewis went on to become a longstanding congressman. He was elected in 1986 to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Georgia&#8217;s fifth congressional district. He held his post until his death last year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The naming gift was made by donors who prefer to remain anonymous. This is the first college that UCSC has named since 2016, when the former College Eight was named for the pioneering environmentalist Rachel Carson, a marine biologist best known for her groundbreaking nonfiction book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Spring.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joint announcement, held on campus at UCSC&#8217;s Namaste Lounge, and the University of California Washington Center in Washington, D.C., met with loud whoops and a standing ovation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now we begin the hard work to live up to this extraordinary honor and responsibility," said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive, speaking from the Washington Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a joyous moment for our campus, attesting to our deep commitment to educate students to become agents for justice, equity, inclusivity, and social change, and marking our ambition to be an educational institution that, through our mission and the work of the students who choose to learn here, continues to honor the legacy of Representative Lewis,&#8221; Larive continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larive noted that the college is the youngest on campus, and one of its most diverse.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of its 1,500 undergraduates, more than 60 percent grew up speaking another language either in addition to or instead of English, and more than 30 percent are first-generation students, the first in their family to attend college,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who attended the Namaste event were given blue souvenir T-shirts with one of Lewis&#8217;s famous sayings on one side: &#8220;Go out there. Speak up. Speak out. Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news was cause for celebration for Chloe Magidoff (John R. Lewis '22, legal studies), who said that her college community finally has a name to match its mission.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a student, I chose College Ten because of its social justice and community values," she said. &#8220;The name connects very deeply to what we have been learning here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been aware of John Lewis and his work for a long time,&#8221; said Magidoff, who serves in the student government, representing her college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name change brings a whole new level of engagement with the issues that College Ten holds dear, she continued. &#8220;When you connect those values to a person, it&#8217;s much more tangible.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Moran (John R. Lewis '22, politics, critical race and ethnic studies), who also serves in the student government, savored the moment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It means a lot," he said. &#8220;John Lewis was a great fighter in congress, and it is amazing that we get to have a college&#8212;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">college&#8212;dedicated to him.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies Professor and John R. Lewis College Provost Flora Lu spoke about the immersive learning that all the college&#8217;s students receive, giving them a living sense of Lewis&#8217;s legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All entering students take courses examining the roots of prejudice and violence," she told the crowd at the Namaste Lounge. &#8220;Our students learn to think critically about privilege and inequality and forms of resistance. We teach our students that they are complex, with intersectional identities. We have a shared humanity and are all worthy of dignity and respect.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emeritus professor of sociology John Brown Childs moved the crowd when he spoke about the newly named college &#8220;standing strong, inspired by John Lewis&#8217;s life, animated by the creative energy of our students, faculty, alumni, and staff, and supported by our generous donors and hardworking administrators.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke of the critical importance of social justice workshops and training at John R. Lewis College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today our democracy is in danger,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;We are confronted by voices and actions inflaming our nation with fear and hatred. The voting rights that so many struggled and died for now face an alarming avalanche of restrictive voting bills.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), who attended the ceremony in Washington, shared a moving anecdote about traveling to Selma, Alabama, in March of 2020. Panetta and his family walked arm in arm with Lewis over the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the 55th anniversary of historic voting rights protests. Lewis was seriously injured in the March 5, 1965, protests, often referred to as &#8220;Bloody Sunday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This enshrines his legacy on the Central Coast of California,&#8221; Panetta said. &#8220;He was and still is the conscience of congress. Now John Lewis is the conscience of this college, and the students at John Lewis College will be the conscience of who we are as a country.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linda Earley Chastang, who served as John Lewis&#8217;s chief of staff when he was in congress, and is now president and CEO of the John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation, was a special guest at the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can only begin to tell you how excited John Lewis would be to celebrate with you," she said. &#8220;Young people were very important to him, and there was nothing more important to him than a good education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The naming endowment will allow the college to advance its mission of justice and social equity with a number of potential projects including:&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Good Trouble Academy:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Named for John R. Lewis&#8217;s famous credo about the need to get into &#8220;good trouble, necessary trouble" in the face of profound injustice, this on-campus academy will train students in the art of collective action with the help of a diverse group of community organizers and activists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Social justice internships and support: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC already takes part in social justice internships, but this program would have a special focus on John R. Lewis college students while providing stipends for underresourced students&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Expansion of programs geared toward the graduates of historically black colleges, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">enabling them to attend Ph.D. programs at UCSC. Though UCSC already participates in such a program, it could be expanded, according to community supporters of the naming gift.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the ideas being discussed for the college&#8217;s future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larive thanked the organizations and people that made this week&#8217;s renaming possible. Among them: Michael Collins and The John R. Lewis Trust, represented at the ceremony by Linda Earley Chastang, former chief of staff to Congressman Lewis and president and CEO of the John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation; former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young; U.S. Congressman Jimmy Panetta; University of California President Michael V. Drake; the Reverend Dwight Andrews; and the generous donors.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c3f5042a807270466cc00b00c70b684e"><name>prescribed-burns</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prescribed burns scheduled today to Nov. 5 in Wilder Ranch State Park</title><summary>California State Parks is planning to begin prescribed burns at Wilder Ranch State Park in Santa Cruz County beginning today (Oct. 27), pending weather conditions.</summary><start-date>1635318000000</start-date><display-name>Prescribed burns scheduled today to Nov. 5 in Wilder Ranch State Park</display-name><path>/2021/10/prescribed-burns</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/prescribed-burns</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1635375186965</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635375186965</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>California State Parks is planning to begin prescribed burns at </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id%3D549&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635449872979000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtbfTLAnaK26a-SHsOe-HDpOQpoQ" href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=549" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Wilder Ranch State Park</span></a><span> in Santa Cruz County beginning today (Oct. 27), pending weather conditions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These burns are part of the prescribed fire program for vegetation management, hazardous fuel load reduction, wildlife habitat improvement, and other ecological benefits. This treatment will enhance the health of the grassland by removing thatch, restoring essential nutrients to the so</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>, </span><span>and reducing the chance of a catastrophic</span><span> </span><span>wildfire.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The burns are scheduled between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. starting on Wednesday, Oct. 27 through Friday, Nov. 5, 2021. Proactive monitoring and patrol will continue through the week and weekend.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At Wilder Ranch State Park, California State Parks will burn roughly 600 acres of different grassland habitats. Some trails will be closed temporarily to ensure public safety, including Enchanted Loop, Baldwin Loop, Wilder Ridge and Zane Gray Cutoff Loop.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These prescribed burns are permitted, planned and coordinated with the Monterey Bay Air Quality Management District and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in order to minimize the smoke impacts on surrounding communities. All burning depends on weather and air quality conditions that are favorable for smoke dispersal. If the conditions are not conducive for burning, the burns will be rescheduled.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>People around the Monterey Bay area as well as those driving on Highway 1 may see smoke on the day of the burns. In the unlikely event you smell smoke, Santa Cruz County officials urge you to take precautions and use common sense to reduce any harmful health effects by limiting outdoor activities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Prescribed burns produce significantly less smoke than wildfire. If you see or smell smoke in your surroundings, officials recommend avoiding strenuous outdoor activity and remaining indoors as much as possible. These precautions are especially important for children, the elderly and people with respiratory and heart conditions.</span><span> P</span><span>lease use extreme caution while driving near prescribed fire operations due to fire personnel and equipment in the area.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Personnel participating in the project will adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state guidelines to minimize exposure to and the spread of COVID-19. California State Parks is adhering to the safety protocols set by public health officials and have made accommodations to limit exposure among first responders and field crews to protect staff from COVID-19 during prescribed burns.</span></p>

I am thrilled and honored to announce that <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635449877872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTk7WJ7yT7froKtoQi9lFBBJWi4A" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">College Ten will be named John R. Lewis College</a>. The naming was announced just a few minutes ago during a virtual event, with students, faculty, staff, campus leaders and special guests gathered both on our campus and at the University of California&#8217;s Washington Center in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Representative Lewis was a civil rights icon, a leader in this country&#8217;s historic and continuing struggle for freedom, equality, democracy, and basic human rights for all. He was an organizer whose bravery and conviction helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He later served 30-plus years in the House of Representatives, where he became known as the &#8220;conscience of Congress&#8221; for his commitment to justice and equity.</p>
<p>While Representative Lewis represented Atlanta in Congress, his constituency always included the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised, regardless of where they called home. UC Santa Cruz, with our mission to provide access and opportunity to all, strives to honor Representative Lewis&#8217; legacy through educational experiences with transformative power that give our students the tools they need to change their own lives and to change the world.</p>
<p>Our residential colleges are an important component of the UC Santa Cruz student experience. Each of our 10 colleges is a hub of intellectual and social engagement &#8212; a unique living and learning environment that provides a platform for engaging in a large research institution. College Ten is our youngest and one of our most diverse colleges. Of its roughly 1,500 undergraduates, more than 60 percent grew up speaking another language either in addition to or instead of English, and more than 30 percent are first-generation students, the first in their family to attend college. College Ten is home to a series of robust programs designed to realize its founding themes of Social Justice and Community, all aimed at empowering students to create positive change. It is a fitting choice for College Ten to become John R. Lewis College.</p>
<p>We are humbled by this naming, and excited for the next steps in this journey. An endowment, pledged by a private donor and longtime supporter of UC Santa Cruz, will fund programming, courses, experiential opportunities, and initiatives that will carry social-justice ideals forward generation after generation. While we are announcing this naming today, we will officially change the name of the physical spaces on campus this coming spring, when we will host an official dedication that I hope all of you will join us for. Between now and that dedication, the college and university will begin the development of programming that will highlight and advance the work of Rep. Lewis.</p>
<p>There are many people and organizations who helped make this moment possible. I would like to thank the John R. Lewis Trust, represented by Michael Collins, Rep. Lewis&#8217; longtime chief of staff and current senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young, Rep. Jimmy Panetta, University of California President Michael V. Drake, and the Rev. Dwight Andrews also helped advance our proposal. I am also deeply grateful for the extraordinary donor behind this naming, whose continued, selfless acts of philanthropy demonstrate to us how to advance vital and just causes in meaningful ways with kindness, humility, and joy.</p>
<p>John Lewis did immense good in his lifetime, demonstrating the remarkable difference just one person can make. A college in his name is a profound honor and a great responsibility for UC Santa Cruz. Our campus community will strive daily to live up to the legacy of Representative Lewis, to answer his call to create a more just and fair society, and to leave the world a better place than we found it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy</p>
<p>Cynthia Larive<br/>Chancellor</p>

<p>27 de octubre del 2021</p>
<p>Estimada comunidad del campus:</p>
<p>Hoy es un d&#237;a memorable para la UC Santa Cruz y para nuestra extendida comunidad del campus. Me emociona y honra anunciar que <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635449877872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTk7WJ7yT7froKtoQi9lFBBJWi4A" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">el College Ten ahora se nombrar&#225; John R. Lewis College</a>. El nombre se anunci&#243; hace apenas unos minutos durante un acto virtual, con estudiantes, miembros de la facultad, personal, dirigentes del campus e invitados especiales reunidos tanto en nuestro campus y en el Centro Washington de la Universidad de California en el Distrito de Columbia.</p>
<p>El Representante Lewis fue un &#237;cono de los derechos civiles, un l&#237;der en la lucha hist&#243;rica y actual de este pa&#237;s por la libertad, la igualdad, la democracia y los derechos humanos b&#225;sicos para todos. &#201;l fue un organizador cuya bravura y convicciones ayudaron a allanar el camino para la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derecho al Voto de 1965. M&#225;s adelante sirvi&#243; durante m&#225;s de 30 a&#241;os en la C&#225;mara de Representantes, donde lleg&#243; a ser conocido cono &#8220;la conciencia del Congreso&#8221; por su dedicaci&#243;n a la justicia e igualdad.</p>
<p>Mientras el Representante Lewis represent&#243; a Atlanta en el Congreso, su electorado siempre incluy&#243; a los desfavorecidos y a los privados de derechos civiles, vinieran de donde vinieran. La UC Santa Cruz, con nuestra misi&#243;n de proporcionar acceso y oportunidades a todos, nos lleva a honrar el legado del Representante Lewis mediante experiencias docentes con el poder de transformaci&#243;n que entrega a nuestros estudiantes los instrumentos que ellos necesitan para cambiar sus propias vidas y cambiar el mundo.</p>
<p>Nuestros colegios residenciales son un componente importante de la experiencia estudiantil en la UC Santa Cruz. Cada uno de nuestros 10 colegios es un n&#250;cleo de empe&#241;os intelectuales y sociales &#8212; un ambiente &#250;nico de vivencia y aprendizaje que proporciona una plataforma para encajar en una gran instituci&#243;n de investigaciones. College Ten es el m&#225;s joven de nuestros colegios y uno de los m&#225;s diversos. De sus aproximadamente 1,500 estudiantes de bachillerato, m&#225;s del 60 por ciento se cri&#243; hablando otro idioma adem&#225;s o en vez de, el ingl&#233;s, y m&#225;s del 30 por ciento son estudiantes de primera generaci&#243;n, es decir, los primeros de su familia en asistir a un colegio. College Ten es hogar de una serie de programas robustos, concebidos para hacer realidad los temas con que se fund&#243;, justicia social y comunidad, todos ellos encaminados a empoderar a los estudiantes para crear cambios positivos. Nada m&#225;s justo que el College Ten se convierta en el John R. Lewis College.</p>
<p>Darle tal nombre nos hace m&#225;s humildes, y tambi&#233;n nos emociona respecto a los pr&#243;ximos pasos en esta jornada. Una dotaci&#243;n, prometida por un donante privado y patrocinador de la UC Santa Cruz desde mucho tiempo atr&#225;s, subvencionar&#225; cursos de programaci&#243;n, oportunidades para adquirir experiencia, e iniciativas que llevar&#225;n adelante ideales de justicia social, generaci&#243;n tras generaci&#243;n. Mientras anunciemos este nombramiento hoy, estaremos cambiando oficialmente el nombre de los espacios f&#237;sicos en el campus para la primavera entrante, cuando seremos sede de una dedicaci&#243;n oficial a la que espero que todos Uds. nos acompa&#241;en. Del momento actual al de esa dedicaci&#243;n, el colegio y la universidad comenzar&#225;n a desarrollar un programa que resaltar&#225; y llevar&#225; adelante la obra del Repr. Lewis.</p>
<p>Hay muchas personas y organizaciones que ayudaron a que este momento sea posible. Quisiera darle las gracias al John R. Lewis Trust, representado por Michael Collins, jefe de personal del Repr. Lewis por mucho tiempo y actual consejero de la Vicepresidenta Kamala Harris. El antiguo Embajador de EE.UU. ante las Naciones Unidas Andrew Young, el Repr. Jimmy Panetta, el Presidente de la Universidad de California Michael V. Drake, y el Rvdo. Dwight Andrews tambi&#233;n ayudaron a llevar adelante nuestra propuesta. Tambi&#233;n estoy profundamente agradecida a los extraordinarios donantes que avalaron este nombramiento, cuyos desinteresados actos de filantrop&#237;a nos demuestran c&#243;mo adelantar causas vitales y justas de formas significativas con bondad, humildad y alegr&#237;a.</p>
<p>John Lewis hizo un inmenso bien durante su vida, demostrando la notable diferencia que tan solo una persona puede hacer. Que un colegio lleve su nombre es un profundo honor y una gran responsabilidad para la UC Santa Cruz.

They are among the few salmon that survive in those difficult years and return to spawning rivers to keep their populations alive, according to a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01186-4">published October 28 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em></a>.</p>
<p>The trouble is that this late-migrating behavior hangs on only in a few rivers where water temperatures remain cool enough for the fish to survive the summer. Today, this habitat is primarily found above barrier dams. Those fish that spend a year in their home streams as juveniles leave in the fall. They arrive in the ocean larger and more likely to survive their one to three years at sea.</p>
<p>Researchers led by first author Flora Cordoleani, associate project scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries, based their findings on an analysis of the ear bones of salmon, called otoliths. These bones incorporate the distinctive isotope ratios of different Central Valley Rivers and the ocean as they grow sequential layers.</p>
<p>The team used otolith data from returning (that is, successful) adult spring-run Chinook salmon to reconstruct their juvenile outgoing migration patterns and growth rates, focusing on two tributaries of the Sacramento River without dams that begin beneath Lassen Peak, north of Sacramento. Late-migrating juveniles from Mill Creek and Deer Creek returned from the ocean at much higher rates than more abundant juveniles that leave for the ocean earlier in the spring.</p>
<p>The different timing characteristics of the fish are referred to as &#8220;life-history strategies.&#8221; Those with a late-migrating life history strategy represented only about 10 percent of outgoing juveniles sampled in fish monitoring traps. However, they were about 60 percent of the returning adult fish across all years, and more than 96 percent of adults from two of the driest years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some years the late migrants were the only life-history strategy that was successful,&#8221; Cordoleani said. &#8220;Those fish can make it through the difficult drought conditions on the landscape because they come from the few remaining rivers with accessible high-elevation habitats where water is cool enough through the summer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Recovery strategies</h2>
<p>The finding underscores the importance of providing secure cool-water habitat for fish so they can survive difficult conditions during drought and ocean warming, said senior author Rachel Johnson, a research scientist with NOAA Fisheries and UC Davis. &#8220;Most salmon blocked from their historical habitats appear to migrate just too early and perish once they encounter the warmer water temperatures during droughts,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Corey Phillis at the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California said, &#8220;It appears the late-migrating life history has evolved as an insurance policy against the unfavorable spring river conditions that occur during droughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also projected how Central Valley river temperatures would rise with climate change, leaving only a few higher-elevation rivers cool enough to still sustain salmon. Many of those areas are above existing dams without fish passage.</p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries has outlined reintroduction of salmon to cold-water rivers above dams as a critical recovery strategy for endangered Sacramento River winter-run Chinook. The reintroduction of threatened spring-run Chinook salmon to the San Joaquin River watershed has taken hold. Offspring of reintroduced spring-run Chinook salmon are now returning from the ocean. NOAA Fisheries is also advancing the reintroduction of spring-run Chinook to the upper Yuba River upstream of Englebright Dam.</p>
<p>The study found that temperatures would remain cool enough for salmon to survive in the north Yuba River as the climate changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to reconnect salmon to their historical habitats so they can draw from their own climate-adapted bag of tricks to persist in a warming world,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>By growing for a year in their home river, the later-migrating fish head for the ocean bigger than the others and in cooler temperatures. That way, more survive and return to rivers to spawn when marine heatwaves warm the ocean and depress salmon survival. A Marine Heatwave Tracker developed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center shows that heatwaves have become an increasing presence in the Pacific Ocean in the last decade.</p>
<h2>Heatwaves reduce survival</h2>
<p>A large heatwave currently stretching across the Pacific off Northern California and Oregon, as shown by the tracker, may affect salmon survival. Warmer ocean waters are generally less productive, reducing salmon survival and depressing returns to rivers.</p>
<p>The researchers highlighted the importance of protecting varied life histories that may help a species survive climate change. This is particularly true in California, which is at the southern end of the range of many salmon and at the edge of conditions where they can survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rarest behaviors observed today may be the most important in our future climate,&#8221; said coauthor Anna Sturrock of the University of Essex.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors wrote, &#8220;We show for the first time that the late-migrating strategy is the life-support for these populations during the current period of extreme warming. As environmental conditions continue to shift rapidly with climate change, maximizing habitat options across the landscape to enhance adaptive capacity and support climate-resilient behaviours may be crucial to prevent extinction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The EEE Scholars initiative addresses one of the recommendations from the ESA&#8217;s diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice task force to support and elevate diverse scientists in the ecological community.</p>
<p>&#8220;This effort seeks to remove critical barriers to full participation in the retention and promotion of scholars who have traditionally been excluded or underrepresented in our community to make ESA more inclusive, especially for Black, indigenous, and people of color,&#8221; said ESA President Dennis Ojima.</p>
<p>Zavaleta received the ESA&#8217;s 2021 Commitment to Human Diversity in Ecology Award earlier this year. Since 2015, she has directed the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a>, which recruits a diverse cohort of students each year for experiential training in field research and conservation leadership. As a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, Zavaleta launched the <a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/">Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-Based Opportunities (CAMINO)</a> for students in ecology and conservation programs and developed a training program for preventing sexual harassment in field biology activities.</p>
<p>Zavaleta&#8217;s research focuses on global change ecology, conservation justice, and addressing racial disparities in science. She studies the effects of biodiversity and climate changes on ecological and sociocultural systems, the effectiveness of conservation under rapid global changes, and the effectiveness of programs that address racial disparities in science and conservation.</p>
<p>Zavaleta earned her B.A. and M.A. in anthropology and a Ph.D. in biological sciences at Stanford University. She joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2003.</p>
<p>EEE Scholars receive an award of $5000 over two years to support travel for a speaking opportunity at an ESA annual meeting or event, to support research or family/childcare, to host a research topic web event, and for publication fees in one of ESA&#8217;s open access journals. ESA anticipates the experience will build peer support among the scholars and its alumni in addition to access to mentors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecology shows us that diversity within an ecosystem makes it stronger. Today, we take one small step to showcase the excellence of diverse ecologists in our profession. We recognize that more work is needed. ESA is committed to increasing opportunities for BIPOC ecologists. Young ecologists or those considering a career in ecology will be influenced if they see themselves represented by those in leadership positions,&#8221; said ESA Diversity Committee Chair Carmen Cid.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s nothing Egill Bjarnason enjoys more than a good story. Like the October day in 1975 when 90 percent of the women in his native country of Iceland decided to take the day off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flights were cancelled, classrooms sat empty, and bankers found themselves answering phones as women gathered in downtown Reykjavik to protest the fact they were paid less and didn&#8217;t get the same opportunities as men. One woman, anthropologist Sigridur Duna, a child at the time, recalled how the smell of burning meat filled her neighborhood as men attempted to cook, with catastrophic results.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That 24 hours of ringing phones and spoiled dinners would, however, reverberate around the world, as UC Santa Cruz alum Bjarnason writes in his 2021 book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Iceland Changed the World: The Big History of a Small Island</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Five years later, Iceland would elect former theater director Vigdis Finnbogadottir as president, the world&#8217;s first democratically elected female head of state, and set the stage for Iceland to become a global role model in gender-equality policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That story is just one in Bjarnason&#8217;s 288-page tome, which the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called &#8220;a joyously peculiar book&#8221; that explains exactly how one tiny island has influenced the world. Published by Penguin, the book reflects Bjarnason&#8217;s time at UC Santa Cruz where he earned a master&#8217;s degree in social documentation in 2015. His stories are quirky and inspiring, often told through the eyes of everyday Icelanders, an independent, risk-taking, confident people who didn&#8217;t have a word for nepotism until 1995 since almost everyone is more or less related and that&#8217;s just how things worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s the story of the open scorn the feisty Icelanders had for the Nazis who came to explore the island and how the tiny nation helped prevent Germany from winning the Battle of the Atlantic. Another tale documents the role Iceland played in birthing the country of Israel when the island&#8217;s freshly minted ambassador to the U.N. did what any good Icelander would do and took a job nobody else wanted because Icelanders don&#8217;t duck responsibility. He ended up heading a U.N. ad hoc committee tasked with deciding what to do with Palestine and delivered a rousing speech urging the international body to vote for a two-state solution, according to Bjarnason.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think one of the basic principles of Soc Doc [the Social Documentation program at UC Santa Cruz] is about giving voice to people being left out of the local, national, and global conversations,&#8221; said B. Ruby Rich, emerita professor of film and digital media at UC Santa Cruz, &#8220;and finding a way to let those voices be communicated and recognized. &#8230; I think he [Bjarnason] may very well have used the Soc Doc idea that you can change the lens and see a different version of history and geography&#8221; for his book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bjarnason, now a freelance journalist for media companies from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Associated Press, agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking by phone from his home in the northern beach town of Husavik, Iceland, he said, &#8220;I always liked the Soc Doc idea that you can initiate change with stories and that stories are the best way to move things forward; to get people to look at an issue and mobilize change.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bjarnason&#8217;s career as a storyteller began when he was still a teenager. At 18, he quit school and headed to Palestine to explore and document life there. With the wry sense of humor that permeates his book, Bjarnason explained how, in a country of only 360,000 people, Icelanders tend to be filled with self-importance, which breeds confidence and also risk-taking. So, a failure, like dropping out of school, is easily forgiven in that country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way the school system is set up in Iceland, it incentivizes dropouts,&#8221; Bjarnason, 33, said with a sparkle in his voice. &#8220;I totally blame the school system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Palestine, he got a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science, worked as a journalist, and then came to UC Santa Cruz as a Fulbright Scholar. At UC Santa Cruz, he said, he not only mastered technical skills but also learned the importance of planning, commitment, and being nimble. His thesis film, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Ice Melts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, started out as a film about mining and ended up as an exploration of what happens when globalization and climate change meet an Indigenous community in Greenland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His book was born after he returned to Iceland and began working as a freelance journalist. The Associated Press, he said, approached him about researching and penning a series of pre-written obituaries for influential Icelanders. The AP keeps an archive of obituaries for famous people that can be quickly sent out to other media when someone dies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And that got me thinking about the theme of my book: how Iceland has made an impact on world history,&#8221; Bjarnason said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spent eight years researching and writing the book, creating a narrative that is both approachable and view-changing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now working on a proposal for another book project and penning articles for news organizations, Bjarnason believes Iceland&#8217;s next appearance on the world stage will be centered on environmental solutions to climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iceland is making an impact on being greener and finding green solutions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s going to be my theme for the next couple of years."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/10/images/egill-bjarnason-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/10/images/egill-bjarnason-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>egill-bjarnason-featured.jpg</name><file-size>14012</file-size><width>500</width><height>203</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Egill BJarnason</thumb-alt><title>Egill Bjarnason: Big History of a Small Island</title><description>Egill Bjarnason, a journalist and Soc Doc alumnus, explains how his native Iceland changed the world in a "joyously peculiar book."</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c8a9292e807270466cc00b001d265e1b"><name>open-enrollment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2021 for UC Faculty &amp; Staff Starts Today</title><summary>University of Californiaâs annual Open Enrollment (OE) period will take place from 8 a.m. October 28th through 5 p.m. on November 19th.</summary><start-date>1635404400000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment 2021 for UC Faculty &amp; Staff Starts Today</display-name><path>/2021/10/open-enrollment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/10/open-enrollment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1635454101742</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635454101742</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>University of California&#8217;s annual Open Enrollment (OE) period will take place from </span><span>8 a.m. October 28</span><span>th</span><span> through 5 p.m. on November 19</span><span>th</span><span>.</span><span> Changes made during Open Enrollment become effective January 1, 2022.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC is offering the same high-quality health plans as last year, with minimal increases in premiums &#8212; ranging from $0 to $47 per month, depending on the medical plan you choose and the family members you cover. There are a few important changes you should know about, including increases to some medical plan premiums, a new administrator for prescription drug benefits for UC Care, UC Health Savings Plan and CORE medical plans; family service enhancements to legal insurance benefits; and an increase in annual contact lens allowance for the optical plan. Now is the time to make decisions around your coverage for next year. If you decide that your health and welfare benefits should remain unchanged, your benefits will continue with no action necessary for </span><span>most</span><span> plans. As always, if you want to continue participation in Health and/or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA&#8217;s), enrollment is required annually during Open Enrollment.

All the same, as we have seen in recent years unplanned events can occur, leading to<span>&#160;</span><span class="il">disruptions</span><span>&#160;</span>to instruction. Many in our community are already experiencing intermittent power<span>&#160;</span><span class="il">outages</span>, as well as the need to stay at home due to illness or quarantine, and a variety of situations, from weather to protest activities, can make the<span>&#160;</span><span class="il">campus</span><span>&#160;</span>inaccessible. In case there are<span>&#160;</span><span class="il">disruptions</span><span>&#160;</span>to your planned teaching activities, the<span>&#160;</span><em>Teaching During Unplanned Events</em><span>&#160;</span>webpage has been revamped to provide centralized<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/unplanned-events&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637083938120000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3EedQq1iEBoPYeP-PL4wET" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/unplanned-events" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resources and guidance</a>, which may be useful for you if you need to quickly shift modalities for delivering your classes. This page can be useful if you anticipate a<span>&#160;</span><span class="il">disruption</span>, or if you encounter an unanticipated obstacle to your existing teaching plans on any given day.</p>
