of computational media at UC Santa Cruz, has received funding through the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/pit-un/">Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)</a> for a program to provide community-engaged experiential learning for students. The program involves a scalable community consultancy delivering public interest technology to help local organizations, and it includes both a formal course and co-curricular opportunities for students.</p>
<p>Lee, who leads the <a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/">Tech4Good Lab</a> at UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, will build on a successful pilot program he led last spring with 130 students in his Business Strategy and Information Systems class. Working with the <a href="https://www.mountainartcenter.org/">Santa Cruz Mountains Art Center</a>, the class delivered a large strategic assessment and design exploration consulting project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We organized the whole class around one big project, blending together aspects of business strategy and human-centered design to develop a deep understanding of the partner organization&#8217;s needs and strategic direction,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>Students surveyed more than 100 volunteers, staff, and clients of the nonprofit arts organization, conducted more than 50 interviews, analyzed the results, and brainstormed ideas. They explored dozens of concepts to help meet the center&#8217;s needs, of which several were selected for further development.</p>
<p>With the PIT-UN grant, a new iteration of the course will include a co-curricular component open to more students than the roughly 150 in the formal course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can now build on what we&#8217;ve learned to establish something that works in a sustainable way, including a co-curricular component so that students who might not have time to take the course can be involved for a few hours a week and still accomplish something in the real world,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Usually, it&#8217;s hard to do project-based courses with large numbers of students, so one aspect of this is creating opportunities for more students.&#8221;</p>
<p>To organize the students&#8217; work on such a large, complex project, Lee uses a novel approach based on his research on the use of &#8220;micro-role hierarchies&#8221; in experiential learning. The idea is to break the project down into discrete chunks (micro-roles), while tracking individual progress to ensure that each student is proceeding toward his or her learning goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s organized like a workplace, so students get to experience what it&#8217;s like to carry out a large project within an organization,&#8221; Lee explained. &#8220;The goal is to help them learn not just the skills for analyzing a problem, but also the skills needed to collaborate, lead teams, and organize their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The partner organization, meanwhile, benefits from a more comprehensive assessment and consultation than they would get from a smaller student project or internship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want it to be valuable for the community partner and valuable for the students,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;An important part of that is to set a foundation of deep engagement with the partners to understand the organization and their needs. The ideas generated from this can lead to additional collaborations in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s Business Strategy and Information Systems course attracts a wide range of students. Most are in the engineering school or the business management economics program, but Lee said he also has many students from psychology and other social sciences programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s designed to engage anyone interested in how to design technology for the public interest and do it in a way that is grounded in a deep understanding of organizational needs and business strategy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The PIT-UN grant is important for more than the funding it provides, Lee said. &#8220;Being a part of this PIT-UN community of people doing the same kind of thing, developing novel experiential learning experiences around technology for the public interest, will be really impactful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Public Interest Technology University Network is a partnership that fosters collaboration between universities and colleges committed to building the nascent field of public interest technology and growing a new generation of civic-minded technologists.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd3b3f55807270466cc00b00641be445"><name>policy-review-title-ix</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Review of proposed revisions to the Sexual Violence &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy</title><summary>The UC Title IX Office has announced several proposed revisions to the Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment to ensure compliance with a new state law and to better account for prohibited conduct in the clinical setting. </summary><start-date>1635750000000</start-date><display-name>Review of proposed revisions to the Sexual Violence &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy</display-name><path>/2021/11/policy-review-title-ix</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/policy-review-title-ix</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1635799220030</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635799220030</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr">On August 26, 2021, the Systemwide Title IX Office announced several proposed revisions to the Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (&#8220;SVSH Policy&#8221;) to ensure compliance with a new state law (Senate Bill 493) and to better account for Prohibited Conduct in the clinical setting.&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center will receive $1.3 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Talent Search program to serve 500 students annually in grades 7-12. Talent Search helps disadvantaged students who have the potential to succeed in postsecondary education. UC Santa Cruz has received funding from the program since 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yathziri Orozco, a junior at Yerba Buena High School, said the program has helped her better understand the course admission requirements for entry to the UC system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The staff from the program are really friendly and approachable,&#8221; she said, praising Jacob Urquia, the Talent Search academic coordinator for the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center. &#8220;He&#8217;s very nice, he&#8217;s constantly there for us and guiding us through everything.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to serving students at Yerba Buena High School, Talent Search will continue serving students from James Lick High School both in the East Side Union High School District, Joseph George Middle School in the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District and Bridges Academy in the Franklin-McKinley School District. More than half the students are Hispanic/Latinx and about a quarter are English language learners, with their first language being Spanish or Vietnamese.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talent Search offers a variety of services, including college, career and financial aid advising,&#160; academic tutoring, and more, and is working in cooperation with other organizations in the area, including the Silicon Valley Education Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Silicon Valley Education Foundation will be offering Talent Search students support in science, technology, engineering and math programs through Elevate (Math), a summer program that helps kids get prepared for the coming year&#8217;s Common Core math classes, and the Computer Science Institute, which teaches computational thinking and problem solving skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We hope this grant will be able to provide additional STEM exposure, especially in mathematics and computer science enrichment to low-income students, who have the least access to support,&#8221; said Vy Nguy&#7877;n, associate director at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonia Ramos, project director at the Educational Partnership Center, said the program is happy to be returning to in-person services this year after offering only remote services since the onset of the pandemic. The key to the program is building relationships and building trust with students, she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the program were encouraging even in 2019-20, the school year that the pandemic hit.

Our campus is part of a larger Indigenous historical homeland known as Popeloutchom, which is cared for today by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.</p>
<p>We are a campus committed to inclusive excellence, and Native Americans are an integral part of our community. They include undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, and&#160; alumni, and they are members of numerous communities that we serve. The relationship between Native peoples and our campus is grounded on the very land on which Santa Cruz sits. Members of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, comprising descendants of indigenous people taken to missions Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during Spanish colonization of the Central Coast, have long been stewards of the land. The tribe&#8217;s members serve as guardians and practitioners of the Native culture and traditions that took root here before, during and after colonization in the 18th century.</p>
<p>Native American Heritage Month is a time to celebrate these rich and diverse cultures, traditions, and histories, and to acknowledge the important contributions of Native people. It is also an opportunity to educate the general public about the unique challenges Native people have faced both historically and in the present, and the ways in which tribal citizens have worked to overcome these challenges. Throughout this month we will release stories on our campus newscenter that focus on some of what is happening on our campus.&#160;</p>
<p>Tsim Schneider, Assistant Professor of Anthropology,<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/archeology-coast-miwok-history.html"> recently published a new book</a> that examines the history of two tribal groups in California from an indigenous perspective, offering stories of resilience and detailing how tribal members have worked to remain connected to native culture and their homelands despite waves of colonial intrusion. Schneider, a citizen of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, will discuss The Archeology of Refuge and Recourse alongside other citizens of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria during a <a href="https://calendar.library.ucsc.edu/event/8013836">virtual event Nov. 8</a> presented by the <a href="https://airc.ucsc.edu/index.html">UC Santa Cruz American Indian Resource Center</a> (AIRC) in partnership with the University Library Special Collections and Archives.&#160;<img alt="" height="467" src="images/annual-indigethanx-2021-500px.jpg" style="float: right; border-width: 1px; margin: 8px;" width="350"/></p>
<p>On Nov. 6, <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_JfK8RPSxQw2V3A1kS2OF8Q">the next installment in the Amah Mutsun Speaker Series is planned</a>, with Caitlin Keliiaa, Assistant Professor of Feminist Studies, speaking on &#8220;Settler Colonialism is a Sickness: How Federal Indian Health Failed Native Women,&#8221; also sponsored by our American Indian Resource Center. Keliiaa will speak to the difficulties Native women experienced in accessing health care, and how its inadequacy cost the lives of Native women.</p>
<p>We are inspired by the scholarship being undertaken by Tsim, Caitlin, and other faculty and students to ensure that the stories of California&#8217;s first inhabitants are not lost to time.</p>
<p>We encourage you to look for a story on Indigethanx, AIRC&#8217;s alternative Thanksgiving celebration. The goal of the annual event is to provide the campus community with an opportunity to rethink the Thanksgiving holiday. It also serves to help educate our community about traditional native food ways. The center alternates every year between serving a meal and hosting a speaker. For Indigethanx 2021, a <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_bKzJscOqQz2h1Be2ihHF_A">virtual conversation between Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino</a>, founders of Cafe Ohlone, is planned.&#160;</p>
<p>Native Americans have built thriving societies that have lasted for thousands of years, and Native American Heritage Month is a special opportunity to pause and to uplift that legacy. It is also a time for us to recommit our support for the members of our Native American community and to acknowledge the rich diversity they bring to our learning experiences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e27d0a03807270466cc00b00153360d8"><name>whales-and-krill</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers find whales eat more than expected</title><summary>New estimates of how much whales eat suggest that past culling of the creatures by humans has contributed to broader declines in ecosystem health and productivity.</summary><keywords>Ari Friedlaender</keywords><start-date>1635955200000</start-date><display-name>Researchers find whales eat more than expected</display-name><path>/2021/11/whales-and-krill</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/whales-and-krill</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1635887417840</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1635955158913</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Taylor Kubota (Stanford) &amp; Tim Stephens (UCSC)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/humpback-feeding-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/humpback-feeding-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>humpback-feeding-410.jpg</name><display-name>humpback-feeding-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>77417</file-size><width>410</width><height>272</height></image><image-alt>humpback whale feeding gulp</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/humpback-feeding-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/humpback-feeding-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>humpback-feeding-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>humpback-feeding-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19412</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>humpback whale feeding gulp</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Humpback whales and other baleen whales feed by engulfing a large amount of prey and water and filtering it through their baleen plates so the water is forced out and the prey can be swallowed.

From the perspective of krill&#8212;the tiny shrimp-like creatures the whales feast on&#8212;this would seem to be a boon. But new research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03991-5">published November 3 in <em>Nature</em></a> suggests the opposite: that the decline of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean has led to a decline of krill.</p>
<p>This paradoxical result is a sign of just how much the precipitous decline of the large marine mammals has negatively impacted the health and productivity of ocean ecosystems, the researchers say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty years after we stopped hunting whales, we're still learning what impact that had. The system is not the same,&#8221; said Matthew Savoca, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford&#8217;s Hopkins Marine Station and lead author of the paper. &#8220;We're looking into ways of using this information to restore ocean ecosystems and bring whales back. And hopefully, that will have benefits on everything from biodiversity conservation to fisheries yield to carbon storage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Ari Friedlaender, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, led the Antarctic field projects over the past 10 years that yielded key data for this novel study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study not only increases our fundamental knowledge of the ecology of baleen whales, but also gives a more holistic view on their function in marine ecosystems around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This information is critical because many of the places where these whales live are under direct and indirect threats from human activities. The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing rapid warming that is occurring as these whales begin to slowly repatriate this ecosystem after commercial whaling. Our ability to predict and understand the impacts of climate change and commercial krill fishing are intimately tied to whales and their recovery in a way that we certainly didn't understand and appreciate fully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers came to their troubling conclusion after asking a very fundamental question: How much do whales eat?</p>
<h2>High-tech tags</h2>
<p>Large whales are inherently difficult to study because they can&#8217;t be studied in captivity. Previous estimates of how much whales consume were generally limited to either studies of dead whales or metabolic extrapolations based on much smaller animals.</p>
<p>For this study, the researchers looked at blue, fin, humpback, and minke whales&#8212;all whales that feed by gulping a large amount of water and filtering it through their mouths&#8217; fringed baleen plates until only their prey remains. They employed high-tech tagging devices developed by Friedlaender&#8217;s Biotelemetry and Behavioral Ecology lab at UC Santa Cruz and the Goldbogen lab led by senior author Jeremy Goldbogen, co-director of Hopkins Marine Station. The tags attach to the whales by suction cup and stay on for up to 24 hours, recording their movements, acceleration, sound, and, if light allows, video.</p>
<p>Drones, operated by the Duke Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, measured the length of individual tagged whales, which helped the researchers estimate the size of each whale&#8217;s gulp. In collaboration with the Environmental Research Division at NOAA and UC Santa Cruz, the researchers also ran an underwater device called an echo sounder, which Savoca likens to &#8220;a fancy fish finder&#8221; and which uses sound waves at several different frequencies to measure how much prey is around.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of that put together really gives us this amazing view,&#8221; said coauthor Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a graduate student in the Goldbogen lab. &#8220;From each one, you can learn a lot about whales, but the combination takes the research to another level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Analysis of the data they captured revealed that whales in the Southern Ocean eat about twice as much krill as previous estimates suggested, and that krill-feeding blue and humpback whales off the coast of California eat two to three times as much as previously thought. Fish-feeding humpback whales, however, might eat the previously estimated amount or even less. This range seems to reflect the energy density of the food&#8212;whales need to eat more krill to get the same energy as they would from a smaller amount of fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;As large baleen whales get bigger, the anatomical machinery that allows them to eat also gets relatively bigger,&#8221; Goldbogen said. &#8220;They have evolved these systems that allow them to be eating machines. That disproportionately bigger gulp size allows them to take advantage of abundant food, like krill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers made their estimates of consumption based on their data about prey density, gulp size, and lunge frequency, as recorded by the tags. With these new consumption estimates, the researchers calculated that the early 20th-century abundance of krill in the Southern Ocean had to be about five times what it is now in order to feed the pre-whaling whale population. This implies a complex role for whales in their ecosystems where the decline or recovery of their populations is strongly tied to overall ecosystem productivity and functioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully, work like this can really get people to consider the ecosystem-wide repercussions of human activities, because we are still continually affecting their environment,&#8221; said Kahane-Rapport.</p>
<h2>Processing krill</h2>
<p>The Southern Ocean is among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, largely due to the abundance of microscopic algae, called phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a vital food source for krill, small fish, and crustaceans&#8212;which are, in turn, consumed by larger animals, including whales, birds, and other fish. But whales also help sustain phytoplankton. Through eating krill and then defecating, whales release iron locked within krill back into the water, making that iron available to phytoplankton, which need it to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of these large whales as mobile krill processing plants,&#8221; Savoca said. &#8220;Each fin whale or blue whale is the size of a commercial airliner. So in the first half of the 20th century, before whaling, there were an additional one million of these 737-sized krill processing plants moving around the Southern Ocean eating, pooping, and fertilizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The many twists and turns of these findings demonstrate the potential impact of asking simple questions. By trying to pin down how much whales eat, this work has cast doubt on what people thought whales needed to survive, and how the activities of whales and humans affect ocean ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this idea that if you remove large whales, there's actually less productivity and potentially less krill and fish is amazing,&#8221; said Goldbogen. &#8220;It&#8217;s a reminder that these ecosystems are complex, highly intricate, and we need to do more to fully understand them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mounting evidence supports the idea that a person&#8217;s environment, including things like diet and stressful experiences, can influence the health and longevity of their descendants. These effects are not the result of mutations or other genetic changes to the DNA passed down in the chromosomes, but are thought to be mediated by &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; factors that change how genes are expressed.</p>
<p>Sharma has done pioneering research on the mechanisms of this phenomenon, known as &#8220;transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,&#8221; focusing on how a father&#8217;s lifestyle or experiences can affect the development of his children. In mouse studies, she found that when males are given a low-protein diet, their offspring can have metabolic disorders that affect their development. Furthermore, her research indicates that information about the male&#8217;s diet is transmitted to his sperm via small RNA molecules.</p>
<p>The new grant will fund Sharma&#8217;s efforts to provide a detailed molecular explanation for these observations. This project aims to provide the first deep understanding of the key steps involved in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of the father&#8217;s life experiences and environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Determining the mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance has important implications for public health and policy,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;Many common metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, have both genetic components and contributions from a patient's lifestyle and environment. Only a fraction of the heritability of such diseases can be explained by genetic variation; instead, it is now increasingly appreciated that epigenetic inheritance likely contributes to such diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent findings have challenged pre-existing notions about inheritance of acquired traits, which held that a hypothetical barrier&#8212;known as the &#8220;Weissman barrier&#8221;&#8212;prevents transmission of information from somatic cells (the body&#8217;s non-reproductive cells) to germ cells (eggs and sperm).</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a ton of data now from different laboratories that supports transmission of paternal environmental effects to offspring, but the mechanism remains a mystery,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>Her previous studies point to a possible mechanism, suggesting that a subset of small RNA molecules in mature sperm are not synthesized by the germ cells that produce the sperm, but instead are made in the cells of the epididymis, a long convoluted tubule where sperm mature after they are produced in the testes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sperm carry very little RNA, especially compared to the egg, so one question is, are sperm RNAs transferred to the embryo at fertilization and contributing to embryonic development?&#8221;</p>
<p>To answer this question, she plans to generate &#8220;tracer&#8221; RNAs that she can use to track the transmission of small RNAs from the somatic cells of the epididymis to the sperm, and from the sperm to the embryo. Sharma will also investigate whether environmental perturbations cause changes in the small RNAs produced in the epididymis and transmitted to sperm. Another important question she will tackle is whether these changes are transmitted to all sperm or only a subset of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to investigate whether all sperm are the same with respect to the epigenetic effects of environmental stressors,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to know, because only one sperm fertilizes the egg, so the effects might not be seen in all of the offspring.&#8221;</p>

most compelling science goals and provides recommendations for funding agencies</article-subhead><article-text><p>Every ten years, a committee of U.S. astronomers produces a Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, presenting funding agencies with the astronomy community&#8217;s key science goals for the next decade and recommendations for the programs and projects needed to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, served on the 20-member steering committee for the &#8220;Astro2020&#8221; decadal survey, &#8220;<a href="https://nap.edu/resource/26141/interactive/">Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s</a>,&#8221; released on Thursday, November 4. The highly anticipated report identifies the most compelling science challenges and frontiers in astronomy and astrophysics and presents a comprehensive research strategy to advance the field in the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a huge honor to be asked to serve on the steering committee,&#8221; Fortney said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a really exciting next decade for the field of astronomy and astrophysics.&#8221;</p>
<p>A top priority in the report is a large space-based telescope mission with the goal of searching for signs of life on other planets outside our solar system and providing a powerful infrared/optical/ultraviolet space telescope for general astrophysics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of life on other planets is something people have wondered about since we first started looking up at the stars, so it&#8217;s not just the science community but we think the public also sees this as an important thing to investigate,&#8221; said Fortney, who directs the Other Worlds Laboratory at UCSC.</p>
<p>This is the seventh decadal survey in astronomy, and for the first time the report addressed issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, co-chaired a panel on the &#8220;State of the Profession and Societal Impacts&#8221; which addressed these issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our guiding principle was that the pursuit of science is inseparable from the people who animate it, and if they are not supported we will not get the best science,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>The survey recommended several programs to support early-career researchers, with a strong emphasis on broadening access, removing barriers to participation, and creating an environment that eschews harassment and discrimination of all kinds. Among other things, the report recommended that funding agencies and professional societies should address harassment and discrimination as forms of scientific misconduct. All of the panel&#8217;s recommendations can be found in Appendix N of the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The health of our field depends on thinking about these priorities,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;We need to remove barriers where there are bottlenecks in our field that are keeping people from fully participating and causing major losses of talent. This is long overdue, but I give a lot of credit to Fiona Harrison and Rob Kennicutt [co-chairs of the steering committee] for creating this panel and supporting us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the Astro2020 decadal survey was sponsored by the major funding agencies for the field&#8212;NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy (DOE). To produce the final report, the steering committee weighed recommendations from 13 panels, as well as hundreds of white papers submitted by the astronomy community at large. Each of the panel reports is published as an appendix to the survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;The agencies really try their best to align with the decadal priorities, so the highest priority recommendations typically get done,&#8221; Fortney said.</p>
<p>The key science challenges identified in the survey include understanding planetary systems, identifying habitable worlds, and searching for signs of life on other planets; using a range of complementary observations&#8212;from radio to gamma rays, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and high-energy particles&#8212;to investigate the most energetic processes in the universe and address larger questions about the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and cosmological inflation; and understanding the origins and evolution of galaxies, from the cosmic webs of gas that feed them to the formation of stars.</p>
<p>The survey&#8217;s recommendations include a new approach for planning and implementing the next generation of space telescopes, encouraging NASA to create a new &#8220;great observatories&#8221; program that would provide early investment in technology development to lower the risks and costs of projects.</p>
<p>For ground-based facilities, the top priority recommendation is for a major investment in the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) Program. The report said NSF should invest in at least one and ideally both of the ELTs&#8212;the Thirty Meter Telescope (sited in either Hawaii or the Canary Islands) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (sited in Chile). The survey also recommends a new array of radio telescopes and a next-generation facility for observations of the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>Fortney said the committee began meeting in 2019 and soon had its plans disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. &#8220;We had two in-person meetings, and then everything else was online,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would have been nice to be able to see everyone in person more.&#8221;</p>

The lecture series, a joint project of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s American Indian Resource Center and the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, focuses on issues vital to the Indigenous community of Santa Cruz and beyond.</p>
<p>Caitlin Keliiaa, a historian and assistant professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Feminist Studies Department, will be presenting her talk, &#8220;Settler Colonialism is a Sickness: How Federal Indian Health Failed Native Women,&#8221; a discussion on the young Native women who contracted TB, but received subpar treatment&#8212;or no help at all&#8212;due to their ethnicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sad reality is that they weren&#8217;t getting the treatment that they needed,&#8221; Keliiaa said. &#8220;Local hospitals at that time did not want to take Native women, and the Indian Health Service wasn&#8217;t a system that had many resources or well-equipped medical staff. Native women should have been able to tap into and benefit from both local and federal hospitals, but that&#8217;s not what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plight of these young Native women, many of them between ages 14 and 19, should sound familiar to anyone following the news about the current coronavirus pandemic, according to Dr. Keliiaa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know that because of certain kinds of disparities, whether it&#8217;s poverty or race, certain people are going to be more at risk for certain types of illnesses, whether that&#8217;s tuberculosis or COVID&#8211;19,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to tie that into what this history looks like, and, unfortunately, it&#8217;s a very sad picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The picture is even broader than that. Keliiaa&#8217;s upcoming talk is adapted from a chapter of her forthcoming book <em>Unsettling Domesticity: Native Women and 20th-Century Federal Indian Policy in the San Francisco Bay Area</em>, which explores the Bay Area Outing Program, an exploitative program that sent Indigenous children living in boarding schools into nearby communities to serve as laborers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal for these boarding schools was assimilation,&#8221; Keliiaa said. &#8220;A lot of times we think of that as a soft thing, when in reality, it can be really aggressive. And if you pair that with the fact that Native girls are being put to work in these private homes, with little to no oversight, it is clear that the government willingly placed them in potentially dangerous situations. One of the things I&#8217;m always looking at is the root of the labor exploitation of this program that is always peddled as &#8216;work experience.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>While Keliiaa&#8217;s research touches on decades of inequality that minoritized communities have experienced throughout the U.S., the subject of her book also has a deeply personal resonance. Her grandmother attended Stewart Indian School in Nevada starting at age six and, as part of the Outing Program, began doing domestic work before she relocated to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to go back a couple of decades in my research to really understand that that&#8217;s where it all started,&#8221; Dr. Keliiaa said. &#8220;I became driven to understand this story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keliiaa&#8217;s talk &#8220;Settler Colonialism is a Sickness: How Federal Indian Health Failed Native Women&#8221; will be held through a Zoom conference call at 1 p.m. on November 6.

<p>UC DDC provides funding and mentorship for UC researchers to advance the creation of drugs that address important unmet medical needs. In addition to seed-funding for innovative research in drug discovery and development, the consortium connects researchers to industry for sponsored research partnerships. The industry partners benefit from access to the largest pool of academic biomedical researchers in the United States.</p>
<p>The consortium currently brings together eight UC campuses: UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC San Diego, UCSF, and now UC Santa Cruz. It is governed by experts in drug discovery and development who serve as site lead representatives for their respective UC campuses.</p>
<p>Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and director of the UCSC Chemical Screening Center, is the UCSC campus lead and a member of the UC DDC executive committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz brings to the consortium its unique strengths in the areas of genomics and bioinformatics, natural products research, RNA and structural biology, and drug discovery technology,&#8221; said Lokey, who has 20 years of experience in the area of drug design and discovery, including numerous industry partnerships with his UCSC research group. He cofounded Circle Pharma, a Bay Area biotech company dedicated to early stage discovery of anti-cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very excited to join this powerful UC-wide consortium, which will bring enhanced opportunities for inter-campus collaboration and industry partnerships,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The primary mechanism of funding opportunities for UC researchers is through the DDC's Annual Seed Grant Award. This early-stage funding helps accelerate projects to a position of seeking advanced stage funding or investment. UC researchers also benefit from drug discovery education and training workshops sponsored by the DDC, and members have expedited access to core facilities across the UC system.</p>
<p>To support the translation and development of drug discovery research, the UC DDC prioritizes building partnerships with industry members. Industry sponsors have an opportunity to co-develop early-stage projects with UC researchers and gain early access to licensing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consortium gives industry partners a single entry point to the UC system and makes it easier for them to identify research programs that align with their interests,&#8221; Lokey said. &#8220;From the UC researcher&#8217;s perspective, it&#8217;s not just a funding opportunity. Industry partnerships provide great training for graduate students and postdocs who get to see how the pharmaceutical industry works and make connections with people. Also, doing this kind of translational research gives you a sense that the work you&#8217;re doing has real-world applications.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05a83d0b807270466cc00b00cfb46a16"><name>students-thanksgiving-break</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student action required - Instructions for Thanksgiving Break</title><summary>With the Thanksgiving holiday quickly approaching, there are several COVID-related precautions we would like you to be mindful of as you plan to visit with family and friends over the break.</summary><start-date>1636358400000</start-date><display-name>Student action required - Instructions for Thanksgiving Break</display-name><path>/2021/11/students-thanksgiving-break</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/students-thanksgiving-break</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1636477451502</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1636503678207</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the Thanksgiving holiday quickly approaching, there are several COVID-related precautions we would like you to be mindful of as you plan to visit with family and friends over the break (Nov. 25 through Nov. 28).

<p>&#8220;It was the beginning of the breeding season, and I was seduced by their behavior and the research possibilities,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;I was writing a grant proposal in my head as we drove back to Santa Cruz after that first visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus began the UC Santa Cruz elephant seal research program, a remarkable long-term study of an extraordinary animal. Le Boeuf, now a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, summarizes the findings of more than 50 years of elephant seal research in a new book, <em><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/animal-behaviour/elephant-seals-pushing-limits-land-and-sea">Elephant Seals: Pushing the Limits on Land and at Sea</a></em> (Cambridge University Press, November 2021).</p>
<p>&#8220;These animals are fascinating because they stretch the boundaries of what can be done both on land and at sea, pushing the behavioral and physiological limits of adaptation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They are the largest seals, with males weighing over two tons. Elephant seals dive deeper and longer than any other seals or sea lions, and while at sea they spend 90 percent of their time submerged (more than most whales). The differences between the sexes are extreme, with males three to 10 times larger than females, and their polygynous mating system is also extreme. A dominant &#8220;alpha&#8221; male may mate with hundreds of females, while most males seldom or never mate, which leads to fierce battles for dominance among the males. Alpha males stop eating and barely sleep for more than 100 days during the breeding season, and females fast while nursing their pups.</p>
<p>No other large mammal has come so close to extinction and made such a rapid and successful recovery. In the 1800s, elephant seals were slaughtered for the oil rendered from their blubber, and by 1890 their population was reduced to an estimated 10 to 20 seals on one remote island off the coast of Mexico. With protection, however, the population had expanded enough by 1970 to resettle its former range from Baja California to Point Reyes.</p>
<p>Elephant seals began recolonizing A&#241;o Nuevo Island, now part of the UC Natural Reserve System, in the late 1950s, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences started tagging seals there in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started in 1968, but we actually had some tagging data from as early as 1961, and the research continues to the present day,&#8221; Le Boeuf said. &#8220;Long-term studies are essential for understanding the forces that shape an animal&#8217;s natural history, but they are very difficult to do. It&#8217;s exceptional that we have been able to study elephant seals continuously at the same site for over five decades. We have tracked more than 8,000 individual females throughout their lives and recorded their lifetime reproduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two things have made this possible. One is the easy accessibility of the colony at A&#241;o Nuevo, just 25 minutes north of UC Santa Cruz. In 1975, the growing rookery shifted from the island to the beach on the mainland at A&#241;o Nuevo State Reserve, where most of the elephant seal breeding activity now takes place, making it even more accessible for researchers.</p>
<p>The other important advantage is that elephant seals are exceptionally amenable to study. They are not easily disturbed and do not flee in fear of humans; individuals can be identified and followed for life and their reproductive success determined; animals can be tagged, weighed, and studied on the beach; and they can carry recording instruments for up to a year at sea without harmful effects on their behavior.</p>
<p>The development of time-depth recorders enabled Le Boeuf and his colleagues to begin learning about the lives of elephant seals at sea. Over time, researchers have developed ever more sophisticated tags for tracking the migrations of elephant seals and recording their behavior at sea and the physiological aspects of diving.</p>
<p>The UCSC elephant seal research program has been led for many years by Le Boeuf&#8217;s colleague Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. Over the years, hundreds of UCSC undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, staff scientists, and collaborators at other universities have participated in the research. More than 200 peer-reviewed research papers have been published on the elephant seals at the A&#241;o Nuevo rookery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now know a great deal about this animal, more than we do about most other animals, and UCSC has been instrumental in this work,&#8221; Le Boeuf said.</p>
<p>Le Boeuf co-edited an earlier book on elephant seals&#8212;<em>Elephant Seals: Population Ecology, Behavior, and Physiology</em> (UC Press, 1994)&#8212;but much has been learned about these astonishing creatures in the years since then.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to have been able to bring this new book together in this stage of my retirement,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05e773ca807270466cc00b001150bcec"><name>bullying-policy-comments</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC invites comments on proposed policy on abusive conduct, bullying in the workplace</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy on Abusive Conduct/Bullying in the Workplace.</summary><start-date>1636444800000</start-date><display-name>UC invites comments on proposed policy on abusive conduct, bullying in the workplace</display-name><path>/2021/11/bullying-policy-comments</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/bullying-policy-comments</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1636481594271</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1636481594271</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a </span><a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/abusive_conduct-bullying_10-20-21.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed Presidential Policy on Abusive Conduct/Bullying in the Workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The proposed policy covers abusive conduct/bullying and retaliation by and against members of the University community in the workplace.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is fully committed to fostering an environment free from bullying and abusive conduct and affirms that everyone in the UC Santa Cruz community is entitled to work in an atmosphere free from bullying and abusive conduct.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abusive conduct may include repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets, verbal or physical conduct that a reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating, or the gratuitous sabotage or undermining of a person&#8217;s work performance. A single act shall not constitute abusive conduct, unless especially severe and egregious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy includes the following key provisions:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy affirms the University of California&#8217;s commitment to promoting and maintaining a healthy working and learning environment in which each individual is treated with civility and respect.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy identifies examples of abusive conduct/bullying, as well as examples of reasonable actions that do not constitute abusive conduct/bullying.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy prohibits retaliation against any person who, in good faith, reports abusive conduct/bullying, assists someone with a report of abusive conduct/bullying, or participates in an investigation or other process under the policy.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy addresses free speech and academic freedom. The proposed policy is intended to protect members of the University community from abusive conduct/bullying, not to regulate protected speech. The proposed policy recognizes that freedom of speech and academic freedom are not limitless and do not protect speech or expressive conduct that violates federal, State, or University policies.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy outlines the consequences of noncompliance, which include remediation, educational efforts, and/or employment consequences including informal counseling, adverse performance evaluations, corrective action/discipline, and termination.&#160;</span></li>

The Title IX Office plays a critical role by fostering a campus climate in which members of our community are protected from all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, and gender-based harassment and discrimination. Sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place on our campus. This is a shared responsibility and we are grateful to all of you who have collaborated, consulted, and supported this work.</span></p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Title IX Office will respond quickly to reports, can provide safety and supportive measures as needed, and can work with the complainant to determine how to proceed. By reporting to Title IX, you can help us connect with parties that are in need of resources and support, and provide us with important information for addressing safety concerns on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to emphasize to all staff and faculty that the goal of the Title IX Office at UC Santa Cruz is a support resource for students, staff, and faculty who may have experienced sexual violence and sexual harassment, and sex based discrimination.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage staff and faculty to reach out for support. Title IX is a resource for staff and faculty as well as students. You can report to Title IX to receive support or to assist others in gaining support from our office. Our ultimate goal is to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for learning, teaching, research, and working. You can </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/resources/printable-resourcesandoptions-4page.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">find more information about resources and options on our website here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Report</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that are not confidential, are required to report to Title IX if they learn about sexual violence or sexual harassment which involves a student. Supervisors must also report if an employee shares possible misconduct under the </span><a href="https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SVSH Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have an </span><a href="https://uctitleix.i-sight.com/portal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online reporting form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can use to fulfill your reporting responsibilities and ensure that we can respond quickly or request a consultation. You may also call our office at 831-459-2462. Our office is more than happy to meet with you if you have any questions or concerns.&#160;</span></p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that Biju Kamaleswaran, our Associate Vice Chancellor, Financial Affairs and Campus Controller, has agreed to serve as interim Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. His interim appointment takes effect Jan. 4, 2022, pending approval by the UC president.</p>
<p>Sarah Latham, our longtime vice chancellor of BAS, was appointed as the new Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration at Brown University in September. She will continue at UC Santa Cruz through the end of fall quarter, working closely with Biju. A national search for a permanent replacement is expected to be launched in early 2022, with a goal of having the new leader in place before the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>In his current campus role, Biju is a financial management leader. He has been a key leader in BAS&#8217;s adoption of optimization processes and move toward lean thinking, which involves eliminating wasteful business steps and maximizing employee empowerment to create a more efficient and effective university. Biju strives to make sure our faculty and staff can spend their time on the mission-critical parts of their jobs, not on antiquated processes and tools, with an end goal of better serving our students.</p>
<p>He is a strong manager and has a passion for our core missions &#8212; improving the student experience and enabling research and scholarship that can make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Biju joined our campus in May 2019, coming to us from Arizona, where he served as the Deputy Director of Operations and Chief Financial Officer for the Arizona State Lottery. Prior to that position, Biju was Director Fiscal Budget and Deputy Chief Financial Officer for the Arizona Attorney General&#8217;s Office. He holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Business Administration from Widener University, and a master&#8217;s in finance from Temple University.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Biju for agreeing to lead the division in the months ahead.</p>
<p>In addition to service as vice chancellor for BAS, Sarah was also our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Isabel Dees, our Associate Vice Chancellor for Equity &amp; Equal Protection (EEP), will now take on that role, which closely aligns with her role in overseeing the administration of policies and procedures regarding discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, religion, disability, sex, gender, age and other protected identities. I appreciate her willingness to take on this important role for our campus.</p>
<p>I have also asked Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer to temporarily oversee Athletics and Recreation (A&amp;R), a change that was effective Nov. 1. Lori oversaw the Department of Athletics while she was Provost and Dean of Faculty at Colby College, where competitive athletics was at the NCAA Division III level as it is here, and the department included intramurals, physical education, and recreation. With this experience, Lori is uniquely qualified to steward this area through a period of transition.</p>
<p>We anticipate this change in reporting for A&amp;R to be temporary. In the year ahead, we will continue conversations and engagement about the most appropriate organizational home to ensure the success of Athletics and Recreation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy</p>

At UC Santa Cruz, it hasn&#8217;t been that. Instructors have been dealing with teaching in multiple modalities, helping students reorient to in-person learning, and navigating complex public health protocols. Still, in some ways, including innovations and improvements in instruction, it has been </span><span>better</span><span> than normal. Instructors across the campus are using more new tools and techniques in their teaching than ever before. A lot of work went into making that happen, and much of that work was done by graduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One example of graduate students&#8217; contribution to the ongoing successful transition back to campus is the Instructional Support Corps. The Instructional Support Corps was a group of 17 graduate student fellows from across the divisions who developed instructional resources in preparation for the Fall Quarter that continue to help teaching assistants and faculty&#8212;and students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer&#160;provided funding for the Instructional Support Corps to offer meaningful paid opportunities for graduate students, for whom summer appointments can be rare, and to increase the capacity of the many units on campus that support instruction. The graduate fellows worked with staff from the Library, the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL), and Online Education on projects designed to result in broadly usable instructional resources. The projects are described below.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Open Educational Resources</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Emily Travis, Jennifer Guerrero, and Chessa Adsit-Morris worked with Associate University Librarian Kerry Scott and Katharin Peters, the Library&#8217;s Head of Research and Support Services, on the Library&#8217;s efforts to promote and support the use of open educational resource (OER) textbooks in undergraduate courses. (OER textbooks are free, high-quality textbooks that are available online. </span><a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/affordable-textbooks"><span>More information is here.</span></a><span>)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hybrid Instruction</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brittany Caldwell and Leslie Lodwick developed a self-paced version of Online Education&#8217;s &#8220;</span><a href="https://canvas.ucsc.edu/enroll/GXH4RB"><span>Integrated Course Design for Hybrid Instruction</span></a><span>&#8221; workshop with Instructional Designers Caitlin Binder and Megan McNamara. (A hybrid course combines synchronous and asynchronous elements. Students in a hybrid course typically watch lecture videos on their own time and engage in active learning during class time.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CITL Website</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Katie Kobayashi worked with Samara Foster, Managing Director of the CITL, to redesign </span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/"><span>the CITL&#8217;s website</span></a><span>. </span><span>Harikrishna Kuttivelil, Melody Nixon, and Nikka Malakooti supported the development of the content for the redesigned teaching and learning resources.</span><span> The new site was launched in October.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8220;Booster Packs&#8221;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Batu Aytemiz worked with CITL staff to develop a set of teaching materials (&#8220;booster packs&#8221;) for Computational Media instructors and TAs to use with their undergraduate students. (A booster pack is a curation and distillation of articles, videos, books, and other resources on a specific game design topic. These booster packs provide foundational resources and compress them into digestible bites and also provide links for those wanting a deeper dive. An example can be found </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/boosterpack-leveldesign"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pedagogy and Technology Guides</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Esra Ozban, Ellie Frazer, and Ryan Lambe developed a set of pedagogical and instructional technology guides, which can be found in the &#8220;Teaching Practices&#8221; and &#8220;Digital Tools&#8221; sections of </span><a href="http://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/"><span>keepteaching.ucsc.edu</span></a><span>, for teaching assistants and faculty with Online Education&#8217;s Instructional Technology Support Specialist Dana Conard. Vishal Chakraborty also worked on an OE project: the &#8220;Integrity Key,&#8221; a website that generates a visual key that shows students which resources they may use on exams and other high-stakes assessments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Project Real</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Amanda Carbajal and Elsie Carrillo joined the CITL&#8217;s &#8220;</span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/project-real/"><span>Project Real</span></a><span>&#8221; teaching team to provide design consultations and lead a session on how faculty can best support their teaching assistants and readers. (&#8220;Project Real&#8221; is a multipart workshop that helps faculty identify and address equity gaps in their courses.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>None of these projects would have been possible without the Instructional Support Corps. The Library, CITL, and Online Education are highly productive units, but none had the capacity to produce these new resources on its own. Speaking for all three units, Foster said, &#8220;We are grateful for this funding that both provided a paid professional development opportunity for graduate students and allowed our units and the campus as a whole to benefit from the talents and skills of our amazing graduate students. Their contributions were pivotal to supporting teaching and learning during the transition to Fall Quarter and beyond.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="06ef6f82807270466cc00b00d929127d"><name>feedback-free-speech</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Provide feedback on Support Structures for Free Speech and Lawful Protest Proposal</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz campus community is encouraged to provide feedback on the Support Structures for Free Speech and Lawful Protest Proposal.</summary><start-date>1636444800000</start-date><display-name>Free speech proposal</display-name><path>/2021/11/feedback-free-speech</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/feedback-free-speech</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1636498894702</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1636498974680</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The UC Santa Cruz campus community is encouraged to provide feedback on the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/free_speech_proposal/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634403921521000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTZR0P5DGkCgWkGhRNj0Np6wP08w" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/free_speech_proposal/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Support Structures for Free Speech and Lawful Protest Proposal</a><span>. </span></p>

Knowing there is a heightened risk for COVID infection when traveling or gathering in large groups, we are reaching out today to provide information for reducing that risk before leaving, while you are traveling, and when you return to campus.</p>
<p>We have been tremendously successful this quarter in reducing the spread of COVID in our campus community. Our seven-day positive rate among students and employees remains well below 1 percent, and we have not recorded any cases of person-to-person transmission on campus. We remain focused on supporting the health and safety of our community and have developed a protocol for employees and students with that in mind.</p>
<p>The guidance for employees is below and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/students-thanksgiving-break.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEbvOLUGxMS9vmc5hrOtXBsXMcfw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/students-thanksgiving-break.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guidance for students is available online</a> for those who are interested in knowing more.

</ul>
<h3>Before Leaving</h3>
<p>First, we want to remind you of the University of California&#8217;s <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/10/2021-22-flu-vaccination-executive-order.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXKSZH56poj6JIuYDHY-gDKwoApw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/10/2021-22-flu-vaccination-executive-order.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">executive order</a> requiring flu vaccination for all students, faculty, other academic appointees, and staff who learn, live, or work at a UC location. The deadline for obtaining and verifying compliance is <strong>Nov. 19, 2021.</strong>Vaccination against influenza is an important measure in protecting the health of our communities based on a review of guidance from public health authorities and scientific studies, as well as consultation with UC experts.</p>
<p>For employees, there are two steps to this process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GET VACCINATED OR OPT-OUT:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Employees can receive the flu vaccine via their medical provider or at a local pharmacy.</li>
<li>Employees who wish to do so may affirmatively opt-out of the requirement in writing <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVORUQQjSb-yai1KZk4vlgPUAoOT07ABVoQFoD_L_bMxOEw/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwPN-L2b5YQOnWISd7-IQUwL5MOg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVORUQQjSb-yai1KZk4vlgPUAoOT07ABVoQFoD_L_bMxOEw/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using this form</a> .
<ol>
<li>Those who opt-out will be required to agree to this <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/2021-2022-influenza-vaccination-declination-statement-for-staff-and-academic-employees.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcsszMo-SYOLCtwKQmWjp9x72-cg" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/2021-2022-influenza-vaccination-declination-statement-for-staff-and-academic-employees.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Declination Statement</a> and wear face coverings on campus through the end of the flu season even if campus COVID-19 requirements for face coverings are lifted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>COMPLETE THE FORM:</strong> All employees are required to fill out <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVORUQQjSb-yai1KZk4vlgPUAoOT07ABVoQFoD_L_bMxOEw/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwPN-L2b5YQOnWISd7-IQUwL5MOg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhVORUQQjSb-yai1KZk4vlgPUAoOT07ABVoQFoD_L_bMxOEw/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the attestation form</a> to inform the campus of their flu vaccination status. <strong>The compliance deadline for completing the attestation form is Nov. 19, 2021.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We also recommend you review these <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-faq-uc-2021-2022-flu-vaccination-executive-order.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoLHJe33vN9KAoxckSTwGQEMhyDw" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-faq-uc-2021-2022-flu-vaccination-executive-order.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> about UC&#8217;s 2021-2022 flu vaccine executive order to learn more about UC&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you are 100% remote, then vaccination is not required but is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Anyone planning to travel away from UCSC and its surrounding communities for the Thanksgiving Break should also familiarize themselves with the CDC&#8217;s recommendations for <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7IFhhFxBK-gOvFvQl-_OvWV-XOA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">domestic</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGD1Vj39v3Mi4jCoZWjmrlMog-S0Q" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">international</a> travel.</p>
<h3>While Traveling</h3>
<p>If you plan to travel over the Thanksgiving Break, please familiarize yourself with CDC guidelines for minimizing infection risk at the time of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/celebrations.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636643490299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4gNPoRIS9wyhvFehqdRiEfJFcCg" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/celebrations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">holiday celebrations</a> and carefully follow those instructions. For example, wear a face covering while on a plane or other form of public transportation or around a family member who is immune-compromised if you are gathering indoors.</p>
<h3>Upon Returning to Campus</h3>
<p><strong>For fully vaccinated employees,</strong> pre-arrival testing is not required for returning to campus.</p>
<p><strong>For unvaccinated employees,</strong> pre-arrival testing is not required but is advised. You will need to resume the testing cadence at least once every 4 days after your return to campus.</p>
<p><strong>We recommend that all employees</strong> self-monitor for any COVID-like symptoms within 7 days of their return as a best practice. Please notify your medical provider if needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention and for working arm in arm to keep our UCSC community Slug Strong!</p>
<p>Whether you travel or not, all best wishes for a terrific break.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Sarah Latham  Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b0ff0e2807270466cc00b006ad86e63"><name>giving-day-feature-2021-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The fast and the generous </title><summary>Generosity was out in force at UC Santa Cruz’s sixth-annual Giving Day, with 3,056 donors kicking in more than $629,414, which surpassed last year’s $600,000 figure. UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, parents, friends, and alumni across the country participated.</summary><start-date>1636567500000</start-date><display-name>givingday2021feature</display-name><path>/2021/11/giving-day-feature-2021-dw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/giving-day-feature-2021-dw</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1636568133833</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1637609003995</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/givingday2021carolyn400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/givingday2021carolyn400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>givingday2021carolyn400.jpg</name><display-name>givingday2021carolyn400.jpg</display-name><file-size>68835</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/givingday2021carolynthumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/givingday2021carolynthumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>givingday2021carolynthumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>givingday2021carolynthumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22270</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sammy the Slug was on hand to greet students at Quarry Plaza and stir up enthusiasm for Giving Day on campus.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, parents, friends, and alumni across the country participated in supporting Giving Day, a fast-paced and mostly online philanthropic festival.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The strong response just goes to show that our donors are very passionate," said Marissa Fullum-Campbell, director of annual support at UCSC. &#8220;Donors give to projects because they feel engaged and connected throughout the entire year. They respond to programs they like, especially when those programs are in need of funds or trying to move forward to create new opportunities and exciting projects.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fullum-Campbell said the total figures could tick up in the coming weeks because staff members are tallying results. Some donors gave to the university in honor of Giving Day but did not use the Giving Day platform, so their donations have not yet been added to the totals, she noted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, donors came out in force to support projects responding to the COVID crisis and to wildfires that devastated Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This time around, we&#8217;re seeing more of a return to normalcy, with donors following that trend, returning to projects that have a large student support network,&#8221; Fullum-Campbell noted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a special shout-out for UCSC community members&#8212;including faculty, staff, administration, and friends of the campus&#8212;who put forward their own matching funds or pooled resources with coworkers and friends for matching challenges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the fun of Giving Day is the "real time" aspect. With a finger click, donors could see how their projects are faring in challenges throughout the day. Each Giving Day project gets its own dedicated web page, with detailed information on projects and where the funding is needed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive was one of the many community members who got caught up in the action of Giving Day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I watched the tally inch up all day and into the night" said Larive, who praised the impact and reach of this annual event.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving Day is an important mechanism for fundraising for student groups, but it is so much more,&#8221; Larive noted &#8220;It strengthens our engagement and connections with our broader community of alumni, parents, and employees and builds camaraderie as we all work together to advance the institution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, at least 130 projects vied for funding. Though most of the action happened online, there was a booth on campus with Sammy the Slug greeting members of the campus community, who made pledges and posed for photos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraiser hinges on peer-to-peer outreach, a strong sense of social responsibility, and the good-natured spirit of teams trying to outdo each other to win bonus challenge dollars.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result is a formula for success</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A pattern seems to be emerging; every year, donors and teams keep stepping up their game, with more projects participating, more donors kicking in funds, and more money for teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of exciting challenges kept the adrenaline flowing throughout the day-long event. The <a href="https://okinawamemories.org/">Okinawa Memories Initiative&#160;</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">performed at the top or as a runner up in several challenges, earning more than $5,000 in challenge funds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative, formerly called the Gail Project, is designed to help undergraduate and graduate researchers gain valuable out-of-classroom experience from professionals while advocating Okinawan history. Proceeds from last year&#8217;s Giving Day helped the initiative send a group to Okinawa to capture the stories of many local people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored by Chemistry and Biochemistry Professor John MacMillan, interim vice chancellor of research, the Early Riser gift goes to the two teams that earn the most gifts from 7 to 9 a.m on Giving Day. The Okinawa Memories Initiative also triumphed in the &#8220;Mad Dash&#8221; challenge that took place between 6 and 8 p.m, gaining $1,000 for the project, made possible by an anonymous donor and Herbie Lee, vice provost for academic affairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three teams with the highest number of donors earned additional funds in the much-anticipated</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Frenzy competition, thanks to the generosity of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number-one team in that competition was the STEM Diversity Program, which earned a $7,800 matching-gift prize, with an impressive 381 donors. Matching funds were provided by Xingci Situ, a staff member of the campus&#8217;s STEM Diversity Programs&#8217; Yulianna Ortega, director of the diversity program; and anonymous donors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> STEM Diversity Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides direct services that support students and bolsters their science identity through research training, professional development, and academic support. It supports students from underrepresented and underserved backgrounds to achieve their educational and career goals by providing hands-on research experience and fostering a sense of inclusion, acceptance, and community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STEM Diversity Program has mentored more than 1,500 undergraduates and 215 Ph.D. students in STEM fields over the past 40 years</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okinawa Memories Initiative came in second in that challenge with 329 donors, earning a $2,500 matching-gifts prize. Outdoor recreation provider </span><a href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/adventure/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventure Rec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; weekly student newspaper </span><a href="https://www.cityonahillpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">City on a Hill Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and the </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/make-a-gift/scholarship.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Association Scholarship Fund, now celebrating its 30th anniversary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, took the third and fourth place, respectively.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s Giving Day site was the most engaging and interactive to date, with a U.S. map showing where all the donations were coming from in real time, and also ranking the states in terms of donation numbers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California had the number-one spot by a wide margin, with 3,251 gifts. But almost every state in the union had people who stepped up for UCSC.

<p>Even with all those honors under his belt, Young sounds a little awestruck at being asked to be the guest speaker at the <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/gary-young-morton-marcus-poetry-reading/">12th annual Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</a>, happening on November 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s humbling,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of great poets who&#8217;ve participated so far. To count myself among Gary Snyder and Gary Soto and Dorianne Laux and Joe Stroud and all the other great poets is thrilling, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inaugurated in 2010 and presented by The Humanities Institute, the Morton Marcus Poetry Reading was created to pay tribute to its namesake, Morton Marcus, the author of 12 volumes of poetry and a fixture of the Santa Cruz arts community who passed away in 2009. Each event features a reading by a distinguished poet as well as the announcement of the winner of the Morton Marcus Poetry Contest, which comes with a $1,000 prize.</p>
<p>Young is no stranger to these events nor to its namesake. Morton Marcus has long been one of Young&#8217;s favorite poets, and the two became friends through their time teaching at the summer Writer&#8217;s Conference at Foothill College and sharing the stage at readings. Since Marcus&#8217; passing, Young has hosted several Morton Marcus Poetry Readings and served on the organizing committee.</p>
<p>He is also no stranger to UC Santa Cruz. Young is an alumnus of the university and currently serves as a Continuing Lecturer for the school&#8217;s Creative Writing program as well as working as the Director of the Cowell Press, the letterpress printing operation housed in Cowell College.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve really enjoyed teaching at UCSC,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;The department&#8217;s great and our students are wonderful. And being asked to revitalize the Cowell Press, I essentially have two jobs. I&#8217;m being punished for all those years that I didn&#8217;t have a job!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young didn&#8217;t start teaching until later in his life, right around the time he turned 50 in 2001. Before that, he devoted his energies to his writing and his art. In addition to his poetry and his work as a translator of works originally published in China and Japan, Young has illustrated, designed, and printed several art books and trade publications over the years. Through it all, he has continued to produce incredible poems&#8212;powerful, richly detailed verses often inspired by the bounty of the natural world. And as with most great poetry, Young&#8217;s work is great on the page, but truly comes to life when it is read aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that poetry is aural art,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;The first poems were chanted or sung. Poems were not written down on a page until quite recently in human history. I do like to read and I enjoy talking a bit about the poems. My favorite readings are ones where it&#8217;s split between an explanation by the poet and the poems themselves. That&#8217;s what I try to do in my readings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fulbright Program, the U.S. government&#8217;s flagship international educational exchange program, was created to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The primary source of funding for the Fulbright Program is an annual appropriation made by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>
<p>According to Department of State, Fulbright HSI Leader status has been conferred on this group of 35 HSIs, including UCSC, because they have demonstrated noteworthy engagement with Fulbright exchange participants during the 2019&#8211;2021 academic years and have promoted Fulbright Program opportunities on campus. Fulbright HSI Leaders were announced Oct. 27 during an international plenary session at the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) annual conference.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of the U.S. State Department&#8217;s longstanding commitment to build diversity and inclusion within the Fulbright Program and within all the Bureau&#8217;s international exchange programs.</p>
<p>2021 marks the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program. Celebrations throughout the year are highlighting the impressive accomplishments and legacy of the program and its alumni over its first 75 years, both in the United States and around the world. A <a href="https://fulbright75.org">dedicated 75th anniversary website</a> showcases Fulbright alumni, partner countries, and anniversary events.</p>
<p>Fulbright is active in more than 160 countries worldwide and partners with participating governments, host institutions, corporations, and foundations in foreign countries and in the United States. Many of these organizations also provide direct and indirect support. ECA sponsors the Fulbright program, and several non-profit, cooperative partners implement and support the program on the Bureau&#8217;s behalf.

Fairlie was honored for his August 2020 paper in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Economics and Management Strategy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;</span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jems.12400"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of COVID-19 on small business owners: Evidence from the first three months after widespread social-distancing restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie&#8217;s paper was among the first published in academic journals to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on small business in the United States. In it, he found that, from February to April of 2020, minority-owned businesses were affected by pandemic-related closures at substantially higher rates. The number of active African-American-owned businesses dropped 41 percent, Latinx business ownership fell by 32 percent, and Asian business ownership dropped by 26 percent, compared to a 17 percent decline for white business owners.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings drew international attention to demographic inequities in the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact. More than 160 media outlets shared the news, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">USA Today</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PBS, CBS, CNBC, BBC, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The paper has received more than 400 academic citations and was used in U.S. Senate bills, California legislation, and other policy work that ultimately restructured the $800 billion Paycheck Protection Program to better aid minority-owned businesses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">given testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives and the California State Assembly to share both his original findings and follow-up research that tracks progress toward equitable economic recovery. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s economic team has also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached out to Fairlie on many occasions for updates on his research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I originally wrote the paper and tried to get it out there quickly at a time when we knew very little about the effects of the pandemic on small businesses,&#8221; Fairlie said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, it has received way more attention than I ever thought it would. Researchers and policy makers pulled out one of the key messages: that business owners of color were struggling disproportionately in the pandemic, and that aid was needed to help them stay afloat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie said it has been an honor to be recognized for this work, particularly with an </span><a href="https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/bradford-osborne-research-award/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> named for University of Washington Professor Emeritus of Finance William Bradford and Alfred E. Osborne, Jr., senior associate dean for external affairs at UCLA&#8217;s Anderson School of Management. Over the course of their careers, Bradford and Osborne have published more than 60 research articles on entrepreneurs of color and their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bradford and Osborne are both luminaries in the field,&#8221; Fairlie said. &#8220;Most of my research builds on their earlier work, so receiving this award has been an incredible honor.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="25d390b0807270466cc00b00f207719a"><name>labor-strike</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announced labor strike at UC campuses on Wednesday and Thursday</title><summary>UC-AFT, the union that represents lecturers, has announced that it will be holding a systemwide labor strike at the nine undergraduate-serving UC campuses this Wednesday and Thursday, November 17 and 18.</summary><start-date>1636963200000</start-date><display-name>Announced labor strike at UC campuses on Wednesday and Thursday</display-name><path>/2021/11/labor-strike</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/labor-strike</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1637017161876</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1637017161876</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC-AFT, the union that represents lecturers, has announced that it will be holding a systemwide labor strike at the nine undergraduate-serving UC campuses this Wednesday and Thursday, November 17 and 18. Picketing is expected at the main entrance and west entrance of UC Santa Cruz beginning around 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Up-to-date information will be published on the UC Santa Cruz website at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://status.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637102302712000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jhbM-qQWPYP1e0AwMTjp5" href="https://status.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://status.ucsc.edu</a>. For questions, staff employees may call their Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst in Staff HR or email: <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elrinfo@ucsc.edu</a>. Academic employees may email <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apo@ucsc.edu</a> with questions and concerns.</p>
<p>An all-campus email about the strike will be sent out today to inform our campus community.</p>
<p>This is a systemwide contract, and the University of California Office of the President has been bargaining with UC-AFT leadership to establish a successor contract. The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/news/2021/facts-about-uc-lecturers-and-ucs-contract-negotiations-with-the-uc-aft-10-12-21.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637102302712000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-cPHjI4qXlqbK-R4k4aBg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/news/2021/facts-about-uc-lecturers-and-ucs-contract-negotiations-with-the-uc-aft-10-12-21.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest proposal</a>&#8212;which reflects genuine responsiveness to union concerns related to compensation, employment stability, and workload&#8212;shows the University of California to be bargaining in good faith and working hard to address the most important issues raised during negotiations.</p>
<p>We respect all unions&#8217; right to organize, strike and engage in lawful free speech activities. While organizing and strike activities can create disruptions, we are hopeful that certain actions, such as blocking campus entrances are not pursued.</p>
<p>Preventing vehicles or individuals from entering or leaving campus imposes burdens on those who already must overcome obstacles in their day. Students, staff, and faculty with mobility challenges face additional difficulty getting to the academic core because buses are unable to cross onto campus. Parents face uncertainty or delays taking their children to school or child care. Students, staff, faculty and their families living on campus experience stress about getting to off-campus jobs or appointments on time.</p>
<p>We must all remain informed and adaptable during this strike and through other campus disruptions. We offer the following guidance to help you and your employees plan in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Employees are expected to work their normal schedules on Wednesday and Thursday. Please instruct your employees to check campus accessibility before they come to campus if they are scheduled to work on campus. Employees who work on campus and can safely come to campus should do so in accordance with information that will be provided on the campus&#8217; website. Information will be posted on a special web site, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://status.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637102302712000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jhbM-qQWPYP1e0AwMTjp5" href="https://status.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://status.ucsc.edu</a>, and will also be recorded on the campus communication hotline (831-459-INFO). If access to the campus is not possible, UCSC will issue a Cruz Alert text message and phone call.</li>
<li><strong>Work Flexibility</strong>: To minimize the number of people attempting to access the campus, employee requests to work from home or for an alternate work site should be considered and approved based on operational needs. We encourage you to be as flexible as possible when considering these requests from your employees.</li>
<li><strong>Request for Vacation or Compensatory Time Off (CTO)</strong>: Managers and supervisors may approve advance requests to schedule vacation or CTO (overtime leave) in accordance with policy and labor agreements and as it is customarily administered within your unit/division.</li>
<li><strong>Request for Sick Leave</strong>: You may require that employees provide reasonable documentation to support their request for sick leave if the requested day off is concurrent with the strike day. Managers and supervisors should notify employees within a reasonable period of time before the strike that medical documentation will be required.</li>
<li><strong>Request for Union Business Leave</strong>: Please forward the employee's request to the Employee &amp; Labor Relations' Administrative Specialist, Jennifer May, at 459-1873 or <a href="mailto:jemay@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jemay@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Absence without Approval</strong>: If the campus is accessible and an employee who is scheduled to work on campus is absent without advance approval to use vacation or compensatory time off and has not called in sick, then the day should be recorded as an unapproved absence and the employee's pay will be adjusted in accordance with policy and labor agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Recording Attendance</strong>: Employee attendance will be reported as normal through CruzPay and other time reporting practices. In order to assess the impact of the strike, we may ask supervisors or units to provide additional information on absences for a report to the Office of the President.</li>
<li><strong>Absence due to Inaccessibility</strong>: If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who were expected to work on campus but are unable to access the workplace. Employees should not be encouraged to enter the campus to work if it is deemed inaccessible.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Safety</strong>: Please ensure that your employees know that their safety is always the first priority. Employees should not be expected to jeopardize their safety in attempting to get to work if access to the campus is blocked. Please emphasize to your employees that they should follow the directions regarding campus access that will be communicated through the channels noted above.</li>
<li><strong>Instruction</strong>: Faculty and teaching assistants are expected to hold all exams, classes, discussion sections/ labs, and office hours as scheduled. Rescheduling or relocation must follow established department and college practice and accommodate the needs of the instructor and all students in the class, keeping in mind that students may experience difficulty finding transportation onto or off campus. College provosts and department chairs are responsible for ensuring effective delivery of their academic programs. If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, additional information will be provided to the campus community.</li>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>UC&#8217;s current proposal focuses on compensation, employment stability, and workload</li>
<li>UCSC supports protected free speech activities.</li>
<li>Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community</li>
<li>Campus community should stay informed, remain flexible</li>
</ul>
<h3>UC&#8217;s current proposal focuses on compensation, employment stability, workload</h3>
<p>This is a systemwide contract, and the UC Office of the President has worked hard to try to reach an agreement with the systemwide union&#8217;s leadership. The <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/news/2021/facts-about-uc-lecturers-and-ucs-contract-negotiations-with-the-uc-aft-10-12-21.html">latest proposal</a>, which reflects genuine responsiveness to union concerns related to compensation, employment stability, and workload, shows the University of California to be bargaining in good faith and working hard to address the most important issues raised during negotiations.</p>
<h3>UCSC supports protected free speech activities</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise their constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly, nondisruptive demonstrations which include picketing.</p>
<p>Our campus <a href="https://freespeech.ucsc.edu">Free Speech website</a> provides additional information.</p>
<p>No employee is ever obligated to engage in collective labor activities, such as striking, picketing, or protesting. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Academic and staff employees should remain in contact with their supervisors, managers, and chairs to discuss their schedules and work locations when warranted.</p>
<p>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee and labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9&#8211;1&#8211;1.</p>
<h3>Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community</h3>
<p>Preventing vehicles or individuals from entering or leaving campus imposes burdens on those who already must overcome obstacles in their day. Students, staff, and faculty with mobility challenges face additional difficulty getting to the academic core because buses are unable to cross onto campus. Parents face uncertainty or delays taking their children to school or childcare. Students, staff, faculty and their families living on campus experience stress about getting to off-campus jobs or appointments on time.</p>
<h3>Campus community should stay informed, remain flexible</h3>
<p>Though we do not know precisely how these strike activities will impact the operation of the residential campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. Campus Transit shuttles will be operational. However, potential strike-related disruptions at the main and / or west campus entrances may result in transportation delays, including an inability of METRO buses to access campus. In that situation, we anticipate that METRO campus routes will instead stop at the Barn Theater, and riders can board a Campus Transit shuttle nearby.</p>
<p>TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and modifying regular Loop and Upper Campus services as needed.</p>
<p>We anticipate that three dining halls will be open during the strike; however, dining hall hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the types of prepared food available will be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UC Santa Cruz Dining may be closed.</p>
<p>We anticipate that Student Health Services, including CAPS, will be open during the strike, but services may be limited. For medical advice, contact our Nurse Advice Line at 831&#8211;459&#8211;2591. For urgent matters or emergencies, please refer to our <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/forms/student-handbook/HC-816-After-Hours-Care-Info-Sheet.pdf">after hours webpage</a> for information on how to get care when SHS is closed.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing emotional or psychological distress, call 831&#8211;459&#8211;2628 or go to the <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/counseling/crisis-assistance.html">crisis assistance webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Information about campus operations on strike days will be posted on a special web site <a href="https://status.ucsc.edu">https://status.ucsc.edu</a> and recorded on the campus communication hotline (831&#8211;459-INFO). The campus may also send <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">Cruz Alert notifications</a> as appropriate.</p>

That&#8217;s what makes <a href="https://virtual.santacruzmah.org/doyouknowmyname/"><em>Do You Know My Name?: Sharing The Stories of Santa Cruzans</em></a>, a new exhibition on display at Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History (MAH) such a refreshing change of pace.</p>
<p>Sponsored by University of California, Santa Cruz&#8217;s The Humanities Institute and curated by THI&#8217;s Summer Public Fellow Morgan Gates, <em>Do You Know My Name?</em> highlights the stories of everyday Santa Cruzans throughout the region&#8217;s history who were neither rich nor famous but whose lives are remarkable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scope of the exhibit is broad, and it means to say that anyone who has lived in Santa Cruz County has an important story to tell as a part of Santa Cruz history,&#8221; said Gates. &#8220;Sharing these stories empowers folks to continue to tell their own story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates worked with MAH staff&#8212;particularly installation assistants Veriche Blackwell and Jennifer Villegas-Naranjo&#8212;to create an exhibition that was inspired by the MAH publication, <em>Do You Know My Name?</em> The publication, and now the exhibition, honors the work of Phil Reader, a writer and historian who dedicated himself to amplifying the stories of citizens often overlooked in historical accounts of the Santa Cruz region. Gates chose to highlight 20 people from the area. She looked as far back as 1793, the birthdate of Lino, a member of the Chaloctaca tribe indigenous to the Santa Cruz mountains, and as recently as today with the stories of Oscar Corcoles, a community organizer serving Latinx youth, and Ekua Omosupe, a writer and professor of English at Cabrillo College.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to represent lived experiences in different time periods, different places or environments in the county, and different age groups and communities to capture the diversity of the people who lived or live in the county,&#8221; Gates said.</p>
<p>The work involved in getting these stories documented was not easy. While Gates was excited to have her proposal accepted by THI, she had to grapple with COVID restrictions that kept her from physically doing research at local historical archives. Instead, Gates worked outward, starting with stories from an issue of the Santa Cruz County History Journal produced by the MAH and then contacting historians and archivists who shared their expertise and scanned documents and photos for her. &#8220;Research was a community effort,&#8221; Gates said.</p>
<p>The project also took her to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Regional History Project, a trove of oral histories of the region that has been part of the university since 1963.</p>
<p><em>Do You Know My Name?</em> also gave Gates the opportunity to reach out to people working in the Santa Cruz community right now, including Ariana Jones, a native of Santa Cruz who helped found Blended Bridge, an organization that helps members of marginalized groups find community, and Rhonda Harper who created Black Girls Surf to provide training and resources to Black girls and women who surf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching out to these people and asking them to tell their story was challenging for me,&#8221; said Gates. &#8220;I was nervous that I was being intrusive, and cold-calling felt really awkward. What I realized, though, was that they were excited to tell their story. All I had to do was listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The on-site version of <em>Do You Know My Name?</em> at MAH&#8217;s Santa Cruz County History Gallery through August 21, 2022 is a slightly truncated version with only seven of Gates&#8217; profiles of everyday Santa Cruzans, but it does come with some bonus features. For example, visitors will be able to see a piece of a shaped tree created by Axel Erlandson, an arborist who created elaborate works of natural art by, he claims, &#8220;talking&#8221; to the plants.</p>
<p>Gates&#8217; work goes even deeper in the virtual exhibition, created in collaboration with MAH designer Michaela Clark-Nagaoka, and offering sound clips, photos, and a wealth of rich detail that Gates hopes will inspire future conversations among the residents of Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>This approach of uplifting everyday people and their stories is the hallmark of the MAH&#8217;s History Gallery. It&#8217;s through telling these diverse stories that we all are a part of making our community stronger and more connected. &#8220;What makes any of these stories important is that these folks gave back and shaped their communities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They took action to make people&#8217;s lives better. They educated, made art, gave shelter, jobs. They are relatable. Knowing their names and their stories is a very real act of community.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2969a1bd807270466cc00b00e35619d9"><name>highly-cited-researchers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>List of most highly cited researchers features 20 UCSC scientists and engineers</title><summary>The 2021 Highly Cited Researchers list, released November 16 by Clarivate’s Web of Science Group, includes 20 scientists and engineers at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1637078400000</start-date><display-name>List of most highly cited researchers features 20 UCSC scientists and engineers</display-name><path>/2021/11/highly-cited-researchers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/highly-cited-researchers</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1637077328301</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1637078592039</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/ribbon.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/ribbon.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ribbon.jpg</name><display-name>ribbon.jpg</display-name><file-size>45074</file-size><width>265</width><height>388</height></image><image-alt>clarivate logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/ribbon-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/ribbon-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ribbon-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ribbon-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20292</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>clarivate logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new list of the world's most highly cited researchers includes 20 scientists and engineers at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2021/">2021 Highly Cited Researchers</a> list, released November 16 by Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science Group, identifies researchers from across the globe who have demonstrated exceptional influence in their field or fields through the publication of multiple papers frequently cited by their peers during the last decade.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers on the list include materials science researchers <strong>Shaowei Chen</strong> and <strong>Yat Li</strong>, both professors of chemistry and biochemistry, and <strong>Yichuan Ling</strong>, a former graduate student in Li&#8217;s lab. Also on the list are three members of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics&#8212;<strong>Jonathan Fortney, Garth Illingworth,</strong> and <strong>Rychard Bouwens</strong> (now at Leiden University)&#8212;and a number of researchers affiliated with the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, including Director <strong>David Haussler</strong>, professor of biomolecular engineering, and Associate Director <strong>Benedict Paten</strong>, an associate professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>

<p>Among those were learning about the application process for admission and financial aid, and the option to enroll in community college first and then transfer. Camacho, who now serves as a college facilitator for EPC&#8217;s South Monterey County GEAR UP program, is thrilled that the center has received an $8.8 million, seven-year GEAR UP grant from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>The grant will serve more than 1,600 students in the Salinas Valley beginning in their sixth and seventh grades and on through their first year of college. This GEAR UP grant was one of only 27 programs funded nationally out of 156 applications. She&#8217;s glad these students will have more opportunities to receive college guidance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super needed in those areas where students don&#8217;t really have anybody at home to ask,&#8221; Camacho said.</p>
<p>GEAR UP stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs and is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The program offers customized college, career, and financial aid advising, tutoring, services that extend and enrich the school day and year, such as summer academies, opportunities for gaining job-ready skills in high demand industry sectors, college and educational field trips, workshops on financial aid and more. The program is already offered in Watsonville and in north and south Monterey County.</p>
<p>Maria Rocha-Ruiz, executive director of the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center, which oversees GEAR UP, said the funding will help advance the center&#8217;s commitment to improve high school graduation and college-enrollment and attainment rates for low-income, first-generation college students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am excited about the opportunities this funding will provide students in the Salinas Valley to gain a foothold on the path to college eligibility and realize their aspirations of graduating from college,&#8221; Rocha-Ruiz said. &#8220;Building upon our prior successes with GEAR UP, we are looking forward to our partnership with the Salinas Union High School District and Santa Rita Union School District to jointly foster enduring college-going cultures for students and their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>With funding from the new grant, GEAR UP will serve Harden and La Paz middle schools and Everett Alvarez, Rancho San Juan and North Salinas high schools in the Salinas Union High School District. It will also serve Gavilan View Middle School in the Santa Rita Union School District.</p>
<p>Jazmin Hernandez, Watsonville lead college facilitator for UC Santa Cruz Early Academic Outreach Program, her experience in GEAR UP helped her overcome obstacles as she pursued higher education. She and her mother attended many workshops and programs sponsored by GEAR UP starting when Hernandez was in middle school. When she finally applied for college at California State University, Monterey Bay, she was initially rejected. But her mother, inspired by the information she had received at the workshops over the years, encouraged her to reach out to the university and see if there was a mistake. Ultimately, Hernandez was accepted to the university. Now Hernandez works hard to make sure today&#8217;s young students have the same experiences and are also encouraged to pursue their college dreams. She feels strongly that she wants to give back what she has received. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be here doing the job I do if it wasn&#8217;t for being involved at a young age,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As part of GEAR UP, the EPC will work with partner organizations: Bay Federal Credit Union, Boys and Girls Club of Monterey County, Digital NEST, Hartnell College, Monterey County Office of Education, Salinas Library, Salinas Union High School District, Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare System, Santa Rita Union School District, and UC Merced.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EPC and its partners will offer services that emphasize college and career readiness and create a sustainable college-going and completion culture, work that is guided by recent research, best practices, and a unified framework of academic preparation and college and career readiness,&#8221; said Rocha-Ruiz.</p>
<p><em>The Educational Partnership Center, a program of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Undergraduate Education, coordinates new and longstanding student academic preparation efforts of UC Santa Cruz with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to postsecondary education for underrepresented students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. Through nine vital programs and with support from federal and state funding, EPC provides an array of direct services which support students on the college-going pathway through college, career, and financial aid advising, tutoring, mentoring, academic planning, leadership training, college and career awareness and enrichment, and teacher professional development.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="29ec8bd2807270466cc00b008a21147f"><name>africa-brass</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jazz virtuoso Charles Tolliver to reimagine Coltrane’s iconic ‘Africa/Brass’ on 60th anniversary</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will celebrate the 60th anniversary of John Coltrane’s iconic 'Africa/Brass' with jazz virtuoso Charles Tolliver joining the UC Santa Cruz Jazz Orchestra and Jazz Choir in a reimagining of the work.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will celebrate the 60th anniversary of John Coltrane&#8217;s iconic <em>Africa/Brass</em> with jazz virtuoso Charles Tolliver joining the UC Santa Cruz Jazz Orchestra and Jazz Choir in a reimagining of the work.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/ucsc-jazz-big-band-john-coltranes-africabrass-experience">live performance</a>, featuring Karlton Hester as a soloist and Charles Hamilton as a performing artist will be at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 4 at the UC Santa Cruz Mainstage. Presented by the Music Department, the show is being directed by Charles Tolliver and emceed by KPFA-FM and KCSM-FM radio host/producer, Greg Bridges.</p>
<p>Tickets are $5-$30 and available at ucsctickets.com. (COVID&#8211;19 protocols will also be in place for this in-person performance.)</p>
<p>In late 2020, Tolliver shared with Hester his plan to revisit <em>Africa/Brass</em> for the 60th anniversary and asked whether it could be hosted at UC Santa Cruz. The Music Department went on to invite Tolliver to campus for fall 2021. In addition to teaching a class on spontaneous composition and jazz music theory, Tolliver is also working in Charles Hamilton&#8217;s jazz ensemble to present <em>Africa/Brass</em>. The preparation, which has involved the transformation of the UCSC Big Band into a full jazz orchestra with vocals, has required an intense focus to prepare students for this historical occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project is a great opportunity for the UCSC students to perform the music of John Coltrane, the epic <em>Africa/Brass</em>, and for them to work with many seasoned professionals who reside in the area, providing outstanding mentorship that&#8217;s usually not available outside of New York and other music hotspots. It will also be productive for the music department and the campus as a whole because of the magnitude of what we are performing and the audience we will reach,&#8221; said Charles Hamilton.</p>
<p><em>Africa/Brass</em> was released in September 1961. It is an important album within Coltrane&#8217;s musical journey. Unfortunately, after the recording sessions the original orchestra arrangements were destroyed in a fire in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>At the urging of bassist Reggie Workman, the only artist still alive who performed on the original recording, Tolliver in 1998 created the definitive transcriptions of Coltrane&#8217;s monumental work.</p>
<p>Tolliver reimagined and reorchestrated <em>Africa/Brass</em> by adding a vocal choir as he created and scored it, updating the original recorded performance made so electric by the John Coltrane Quartet and brass orchestra.</p>
<p>Tolliver is an acclaimed trumpeter, bandleader, composer, arranger and educator. In 2007, he issued on Blue Note Records his big band recording With Love which earned a Grammy nomination. The Jazz Journalists Association presented Tolliver with the &#8220;Best Large Ensemble of the Year 2007&#8221; award for his new tour de force group The Charles Tolliver Big Band.</p>
<p>In an historic reenactment and presentation of Thelonious Monk&#8217;s historic 1959 Town Hall concert in 2009, he was featured performing his definitive transcription of the lost scores of arranger Hal Overton&#8217;s orchestrations of Monks&#8217; music exactly as it was performed and recorded for the original concert. His latest big band CD Emperor March, recorded live at the Blue Note in New York City, was released in March 2009.</p>
<p>Tolliver has an extremely individual and distinctive sound which sets him apart from other trumpet players.</p>
<p>Characterized by a strong sense of tradition, he said in a recent Downbeat magazine interview about his approach to improvising that, &#8220;I like to rumble. I take the most difficult routes for improvisation. It&#8217;s easy to play a number of choruses effortlessly and never make a mistake, never break down. That&#8217;s no fun. You need to get in hot water by trying something out right from the jump, get yourself out of that, and move on to the next chorus.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>About the UC Santa Cruz Music Department</strong> </em></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone wants to celebrate Thanksgiving, a holiday that recalls a 17th-century feast shared by&#160;<span>Wampanoag</span> people and English pilgrims.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking back on the destruction that later came to Indigenous people, some have no desire to honor the colonizers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IndigeThanx, an annual event sponsored by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s American Indian Resource Center and Cowell Coffee Shop, offers an alternative. This year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the </span><a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_bKzJscOqQz2h1Be2ihHF_A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be held online Nov. 19. There will be a conversation and cooking demonstration led by Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino, founders of Caf&#233; Ohlone, a cultural space and restaurant serving Ohlone cuisine reopening soon in Berkeley. Admission is open to all and is free.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Lopez, a second-year student at UC Santa Cruz whose family is in the Lakota Tribe, is looking forward to attending. Her family has its own native food traditions, including making fry bread.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having this inclusive space for us, it widens the spectrum of the different celebrations that can take place instead of Thanksgiving,&#8221; said Lopez, who does not celebrate Thanksgiving.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.makamham.com/cafeohlone"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caf&#233; Ohlone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a restaurant dedicated to reviving the Indigenous food traditions of the Ohlone people of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay regions. It has been shut down most of the past two years because of the pandemic but had offered a menu featuring such dishes as black oak acorn bread, venison and mushroom stew, dandelion soup, and manzanita cider.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have worked hard to understand native plants of our Ohlone homelands along with their traditional uses, and listen attentively to testimony from our elders&#8217; recollections of old Indian foods they remember,&#8221; said the founders on the restaurant&#8217;s website. &#8220;This is combined with documentation recorded by members of our Indian communities in the 1920s and 1930s from Sunol and Carmel, records that have been preserved and provide a crucial link to understanding the value, respect, and love our old timers have for these Indian foods; in the process we have developed a deep and personal love for these same foods and have personally seen how these foods can heal, empower, and better connect us to our Ohlone cultural identity.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medina is cultural leader of Itmay Cultural Association, a group of Verona Band culture bearers working to keep their identity strong. Trevino is a member of the Rumsen Ohlone community and is helping revive the Rumsen language.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Hernandez, director of UCSC's American Indian Resource Center, said IndigeThanx is a long tradition at the center and is one of its most popular events. Every other year, the event rotates between a speaker and a shared meal. This is the second year in a row that the event will be on Zoom.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Now in the process of earning her master&#8217;s degree in education at UC Santa Cruz, Anaya hopes to become a kindergarten teacher so she can help other young students in a simiilar situation.</p>
<p>Anaya is among the first 12 students to be a part of the university&#8217;s new Latinx Initiative for Future Teachers (LIFT) program. The program allows participating students to finish a master&#8217;s in education and earn credentials for teaching in math, science, multiple subjects, history or English in 12 months and receive mentorship and financial support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to better myself,&#8221; said Anaya, a mother of five, ages 1 to 16.</p>
<p>As a Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz is constantly looking for ways to improve graduation rates and increase opportunities for Hispanic students to enter graduate programs and high-level professional careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very important for the nation and extremely important for California,&#8221; said Cynthia Lewis, chair of the UC Santa Cruz education department. The goal is for graduates of LIFT and the university&#8217;s teacher education program to work in the schools and become leading advocates for equity, social justice and antiracism.</p>
<p>As of 2018&#8211;19, <a href="https://www.ed-data.org/article/Teachers-in-California">61 percent of California&#8217;s K&#8211;12 teachers were white</a>, with Hispanics making up the next largest percentage at 21 percent. The student population, by contrast, was 55 percent Hispanic and 23 percent white.</p>
<p>Soleste Hilberg, director of teacher education at UC Santa Cruz, said the program is aware that the experience of Hispanic and white students can differ considerably, and is working to correct that in the master of arts/credential program. From focus group interviews over the last three years, the program has learned of the need for mentors for students of color. All those in the LIFT program are paired with a mentor of color to help them navigate the teaching profession, Hilberg said. The program is also bringing in speakers with successful backgrounds to talk to the students.</p>
<p>Hilberg said her program also reallocated their scholarship funds. Now, the program awards more money to those who are first-generation college students or who come from low-income families and demonstrate their commitment to the program&#8217;s mission, which is to prepare new teachers for a new California; teachers who are ready to become social justice teacher leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working hard to examine our policies and practices to see how we might be contributing to societal and systemic inequities and to ensure equity and justice for our students and their future students,&#8221; Hilberg said.</p>
<p>Some of the LIFT students have enough support that they don&#8217;t need to work at other jobs while they are completing the program, she said.</p>
<p>One way UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate teaching program is different than others is it accepts undocumented students. Usually, they are students who were brought by their families to the U.S. as children but never became citizens. They are not allowed to get federal scholarship money, so the university finds other ways to help them get funding, such as what is described above.</p>
<p>All the students, including the undocumented ones, have no trouble finding jobs after graduation, said Hilberg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our students are in big demand,&#8221; Hilberg said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2afbbdd1807270466cc00b007fee1ecf"><name>bookstore-partnership-akademos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The Bay Tree Bookstore partners with Akademos to launch online textbook, course materials platform</title><summary>UCSC’s Bay Tree Bookstore will begin transitioning in December 2021 to an online bookstore platform that enables digital and hard-cover textbook purchases and rentals.  </summary><start-date>1637049600000</start-date><display-name>Bookstore partnership</display-name><path>/2021/11/bookstore-partnership-akademos</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/bookstore-partnership-akademos</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1637103680955</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1637103680955</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/store-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/store-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>store-500px.jpg</name><display-name>store-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>357419</file-size><width>500</width><height>519</height></image><image-alt>Outside view of Bay Tree Bookstore</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/02/images/store-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/02/images/store-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>store-80px.jpg</name><display-name>store-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>16859</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Outside view of Bay Tree Bookstore</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Implementation of this new suite of services will continue through this academic year with the plan to fully launch the platform in fall 2022.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with </span><a href="https://www.akademos.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akademos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a premier higher education platform for course content delivery and analytics, students and faculty will have access to a full-service online bookstore providing affordable and efficient access to an extensive range of educational content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition to Akademos will be overseen by a committee co-chaired by Pradip Mascharak, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Angela Cline, director of business and financial analysis for Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services (CHES).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A committee composed of UCSC faculty, students, and staff carefully considered the services offered by industry leaders in the provision of higher education textbook/course material using a range of criteria that encompassed course material affordability, customer service, accessibility, data security, and commitment to diversity and sustainability.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I welcome this new platform to support the course materials at an affordable price to the students,&#8221; said Mascharak. &#8220;Akademos will take care of all the licensing of the ebooks from the suppliers thereby making it easy for the instructor to adopt such teaching aids for his or her courses.</span><strong>&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students and faculty continue to show a growing preference for highly portable digital textbooks, rental textbooks, and other course materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, textbooks had been the bookstore&#8217;s focus. The upward trend for using digital formats has been mirrored by a steep downward trend in purchases of course materials from the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation of this new suite of services will continue through this academic year with the plan to fully launch the platform in fall 2022. The Bay Tree Bookstore will continue to operate an on-campus and online store for merchandise and apparel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a competitive bidding process, Akademos was selected as the campus&#8217;s preferred partner to create a new online bookstore operation that will offer all required and recommended textbooks and course materials through an integrated e-commerce system. The platform has partnerships with the City University of New York, University of South Dakota, and other universities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty will see a streamlined, individualized and customizable adoption process that benefits from robust search and review capabilities, real-time pricing and availability indicators, and the inclusion of other course materials, course notes and files.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will access a personalized course page displaying only those courses for which they are registered and a list of all related course materials at a range of price points and in a potentially wide variety of formats, including both new and used hard copy versions, electronic versions, and rentals. Students will have access to several low-cost options, enjoy instant access to digital materials, or have an option for their course materials to be shipped to them on an individual basis.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2eab3ceb807270466cc00b0091394a1c"><name>strike-called-off</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Union calls off strike; tentative contract</title><summary>The University of California and UC-AFT have reached a tentative deal, and the union has called off the strike.</summary><start-date>1637136000000</start-date><display-name>Union calls off strike; tentative contract</display-name><path>/2021/11/strike-called-off</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/strike-called-off</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1637165513946</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1637165513946</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The University of California and UC-AFT have reached a tentative deal, and the union has called off the strike. </span><br/><br/><span>Both entrances at the main campus are currently open.

<p>At the time, the computer and information science program only offered a bachelor of arts degree, which allowed Young to learn about computer science while also exploring fields far removed from science and technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew UC Santa Cruz was going to be a great place to explore different academic pursuits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A couple years before I arrived, I had just acquired a personal Apple II Plus computer, which was still a pretty unusual thing. The idea of exploring what I could do with that technology by being in the computer science program was exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>By taking courses outside of STEM, Young discovered new passions, such as the different ways to engage with art through digital media.</p>
<p>After graduating from UCSC, he spent his early career working for an artificial intelligence (AI) firm before pursuing a master&#8217;s degree in visual studies at the MIT Media Lab, one of the first academic labs focused on blending technology, media, and design.</p>
<p>&#8220;Issues we explored in the Media Lab spanned from &#8216;How do you use a screen as a communications platform?&#8217; to &#8216;How do you use a screen to interact with information?&#8217;&#8221; said Young.</p>
<p><strong>From tech to digital artistry</strong></p>
<p>Because the concept of using technology for creative means was still very new, Young didn&#8217;t immediately pursue his artistic ambitions. Instead, he taught communication design at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena for several years and then spent two decades in tech working in the fields of artificial intelligence, consulting, advertising, and global innovation.</p>
<p>Young&#8217;s desire to reach different audiences through technology and his curiosity for using computers as tools for creative design eventually inspired him to withdraw from corporate tech to become an independent artist, where he now employs AI tools to create digital artwork.</p>
<p>While Young was working in tech, he grew concerned about how technology, particularly artificial intelligence, was advancing. Many industries&#8212;from banking to human resources&#8212; increasingly rely on AI to automate decision-making processes. Though this has helped reduce human error and improve efficiency in many sectors, Young noticed that these technologies are plagued with bias that leads to unfair decision-making, often due to a lack of diverse perspectives contributing to the platform&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked myself &#8216;How can I try to fix that?&#8217; Maybe it&#8217;s through beauty and aesthetics that we can get people to think about AI in a different way and develop their intuitions for what the technology is, rather than from a technological standpoint,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Novel forms of creative expression</strong></p>
<p>Young&#8217;s aim to incorporate more diverse perspectives into new and emerging technologies led him to the work he&#8217;s doing now: blending artificial intelligence machine learning technology with digital design to produce works of art that explore novel forms of creative expression.</p>
<p>Although Young has a background in coding and programming, he stressed that &#8220;anyone can engage in AI to create digital artwork without a full technical understanding.&#8221; He hopes his unique perspective will encourage more people from all backgrounds to engage with this kind of technology-driven artwork.</p>
<p>Young&#8217;s artistic process begins with small amounts of data. He uploads a dozen or more photos he&#8217;s taken from his camera to train the machine. Once the photos are uploaded into the machine, he programs it through unique code to create digital artwork. Importantly, the machine is not developing the art, but rather being manipulated by the artist through both code and uploaded images to create a design.</p>
<p>This process stands in stark contrast to the ways in which AI and machine learning are usually employed. Normally these technologies work with enormous data sets. But by reducing the amount of data he uses, Young is able to highlight the imperfections of AI technology and to use the errors made to further shape his artwork, inviting new perspectives on the art produced.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge amount of creative curation that goes into what you train the machine with and how you manipulate the machine to get the results you want&#8212;and then choosing the outputs you think are most interesting,&#8221; Young explained.</p>
<p>Young&#8217;s work has been recognized widely and displayed around the world, including at the Kate Vass Galerie in Zurich, Switzerland; the Schierke Seinecke Gallery in Frankfurt, Germany; and the Asia Culture Center in Gwangju, South Korea. More recently, he&#8217;s begun using quantum computing, an emerging field that draws on quantum properties to encode information in two states simultaneously, to create digital art.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on his career, Young said, &#8220;My work now is, in a sense, a loop backwards. I started off my career doing work in AI, which was at the time just emerging, and now I am doing something that uses a similar application in the artistic world. It&#8217;s a lot of fun to be involved in something that&#8217;s still very much in the innovation phase.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student voting at UC Santa Cruz increased dramatically in last year&#8217;s presidential election, rising to about 79 percent in 2020 from a rate near 52 percent in 2016, according to data from the </span><a href="https://tufts.app.box.com/v/democracy-counts-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NSLVE).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, led by the </span><a href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IDHE) showed that student voting rates at UCSC were near the crest of a broader rising trend. Voting increased at college campuses across the U.S., but UCSC&#8217;s nearly 28 percentage point increase was about double the average rate of increase across more than 1,000 institutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I applaud our student leaders who worked so hard to register their peers and encourage voting,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz students are committed to creating real change, and that often begins in deciding who to elect as our state and federal representatives. It&#8217;s essential that everyone has the chance to make their voice heard on Election Day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While UCSC&#8217;s overall enrollments remained similar from 2016 to 2020, 4,523 more students voted in 2020. Among age groups, the biggest increase came from 18- to 21-year-old students. Notably, voting went up by at least more than 20 percent for UCSC students across every racial and ethnic background. Voting rates were also up among students in every field of study identified in the report.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These impressive and cross-cutting gains reflect many campus efforts to promote democratic engagement and voting among all UCSC students. Among these, Elizabeth Beaumont, Associate Professor of Politics and Legal Studies&#8212;and coauthor of the books&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating for Democracy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating Citizens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;forged a partnership with the national ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge and began collaborating with Student Union Assembly leaders.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, this sparked projects with SUA student leaders Jessica Xu (politics and economics &#8217;18), Alice Malmberg (politics and feminist studies &#8217;18), and Judith Gutierrez (politics &#8217;18) to develop college-based voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote messages. In 2020, it led to projects with SUA representatives Soren Whiting (politics &#8217;21) and Rojina Bozorgnia (politics and education &#8217;23) to develop a new online voter registration guide and UCWeVOTE events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, the study&#8217;s authors report record-breaking findings. On campuses across the country, students built on the momentum swing of 2018 and voted at high rates, with a national average campus voter turnout jumping to 66 percent in last year&#8217;s 2020 presidential election. The campus-average 13 percentage point increase, from 53 percent turnout in the 2016 election, outpaces the general increase in American voting, which jumped 6 percentage points from 61 percent to 67 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm so delighted to see our students engaging directly in the democratic process,&#8221; said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Social Sciences Division. &#8220;Through their outreach and initiatives, they are maximizing voter participation and increasing civic engagement where it matters most. These are our transformative leaders, now and into the future.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a8e1fd6807270462612537cf7d413ad"><name>statement-rittenhouse</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on not guilty verdict in Rittenhouse trial</title><summary>We are disheartened and dismayed by this morning's not guilty verdict on all charges in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse.

<p>We are disheartened and dismayed by this morning's not guilty verdict on all charges in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse. The charges included fatally shooting two unarmed men, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz at a Black Lives Matter rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. We join in solidarity with all who are outraged by this failure of accountability.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that this same week the prosecution and defense concluded their case in the trial of three white men charged with chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed Black man, in February 2020, south of Brunswick, Georgia.</p>
<p>Trials such as these that have race-related implications can cause our BIPOC communities distress and harm. This is harm that is endured everyday through acts of racism, the pervasiveness of white supremacy and a flawed justice system.</p>
<p>We firmly believe in our <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a> and our collective responsibility to continue to disrupt systemic racism. It is important to publicly reaffirm our shared values and to ensure that those who are experiencing distress and impact have access to supportive resources. We reaffirm these values each day through our actions in our own spheres of influence. <a href="https://diversity.ucsc.edu/about/staff.php">The Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion</a> is here to help support community members in the work of building a more inclusive climate.</p>
<p>If you are feeling impacted by these events, please do not hesitate to reach out to campus services for support. Staff in our colleges, <a href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/">resource centers</a>, and <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> provide assistance for students. Our <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a> offers counseling and support to employees.

During an expedition aboard the R/V <em>Western Flyer</em> in 2019, ROV pilot Randy Prickett and scientist Steven Haddock made a peculiar observation. While exploring a seamount located 300 kilometers (185 miles) offshore of California and 3,070 meters (10,000 feet) deep, the team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) spotted what looked like an elephant&#8217;s tusk. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Only able to collect a small piece at the time, the scientists returned in July 2021 to retrieve the complete specimen. Now, Haddock and researchers from UC Santa Cruz and the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/paleontology">Museum of Paleontology</a> at the University of Michigan are examining the tusk.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The researchers have confirmed that the tusk&#8212;about one meter (just over three feet) in length&#8212;is from a Columbian mammoth (<em>Mammuthus columbi</em>). The cold, high-pressure environment of the deep sea uniquely preserved the tusk, giving researchers the opportunity to study it in greater detail. Computed tomography (CT) scans will reveal the full three-dimensional internal structure of the tusk and more information about the animal&#8217;s history, such as its age. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The team believes it could be the oldest well-preserved mammoth tusk recovered from this region of North America. Dating of the tusk is being done by the UCSC Geochronology Lab led by Terrence Blackburn, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Researchers at the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab led by Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, plan to sequence the ancient DNA embedded in the specimen, which could provide valuable insight about how mammoths colonized North America. Katherine Moon, a postdoctoral researcher in Shapiro&#8217;s lab, accompanied Haddock on the July cruise to retrieve the complete specimen.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;You start to &#8216;expect the unexpected&#8217; when exploring the deep sea, but I&#8217;m still stunned that we came upon the ancient tusk of a mammoth,&#8221; said Haddock. &#8220;We are grateful to have a multidisciplinary team analyzing this remarkable specimen, including a geochronologist, oceanographers, and paleogenomicists from UCSC and paleontologists at the University of Michigan. Our work examining this exciting discovery is just beginning and we look forward to sharing more information in the future.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Shapiro and Moon will recover ancient DNA preserved within the matrix of the tusk, which they will compare to DNA that has already been recovered from other mammoths. &#8220;Specimens like this present a rare opportunity to paint a picture both of an animal that used to be alive and of the environment in which it lived,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;Mammoth remains from continental North America are particularly rare, and so we expect that DNA from this tusk will go far to refine what we know about mammoths in this part of the world.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This specimen&#8217;s deep-sea preservational environment is different from almost anything we have seen elsewhere,&#8221; added University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher, who specializes in the study of mammoths and mastodons. &#8220;Other mammoths have been retrieved from oceans, but generally not from depths of more than a few tens of meters.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Fisher and his U-M colleagues will use their knowledge of the structure and composition of mammoth tusks to analyze CT scans of the specimen. The other members of the Museum of Paleontology team are Adam N. Rountrey, Michael D. Cherney, Ethan A. Shirley and Scott G. Beld.</span></p>

Sparke and his coauthor, health policy researcher Owain Williams, gather findings from a global body of social science and public health research in their article &#8220;</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0308518X211048905"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neoliberal disease: COVID-19, co-pathogenesis and global health insecurities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neoliberalism is an approach to government that prioritizes free-market capitalism, and its focus on market-based freedoms, rules, and incentives has become dominant around the world since the 1970s. Though neoliberalism is commonly thought of as being associated with growth and freedom, Sparke says neoliberal goals often come at the expense of societal well-being and freedom from vulnerability. The coronavirus pandemic has made this especially clear, he argues, and the paper explores that concept.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of people look at COVID as a set of symptoms that expose underlying social problems, and we agree with those arguments,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;We&#8217;re adding to that an overview and analysis of the multiple pathways through which this has happened. The virus has gone down these rifts through neoliberal society and actually exploited and exacerbated them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the paper makes the case that neoliberalism has transformed health care, through privatization and commodification of goods and services in place of public investment in social programs and health systems. Sparke and Williams argue that this set the stage for the virus to spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in marketized healthcare and the wide lack of social protections. The paper also traces some of the virus&#8217;s disparate impacts on marginalized communities back to the intersecting damage done by pro-market policies in neoliberal societies.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Coronavirus transmission exploits social vulnerabilities<strong>&#160;&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper describes neoliberalism as having &#8220;hollowed out&#8221; national and global health organizations over time, resulting from systematic defunding coupled with policies of contracting out services to private firms. Sparke and his coauthor contend that these trends left public health systems without the institutional or bureaucratic capacity to manage a response to the coronavirus pandemic effectively.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also says that for-profit models in hospitals and health-care product supply chains failed under the strain of the pandemic, resulting in health-care worker layoffs, hospital closures, and price gouging that limited care and treatment options for some patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, de-unionization and decades of disinvestment from social welfare programs left many workers around the globe without reliable job and income protections or support for housing and health during the pandemic, the paper argues. Sparke and Williams say this meant that low-paid &#8220;essential workers&#8221; had little choice but to face risk of infection under working conditions that aided the virus&#8217;s spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In long-term care homes for the elderly, for example, Sparke says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">low pay and lack of job stability has led many care workers to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, and they often don&#8217;t have sick leave, which means they may show up for work even when they&#8217;re not feeling well. The paper says these conditions essentially turned workers into carriers for disease and allowed the virus that causes COVID-19 to spread easily among nursing homes.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way that issue has most often been represented in public is, &#8216;Well, people living in nursing homes are vulnerable because they're elderly,&#8217;&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;But really, it's also because they're being cared for by extremely exploited workers who do not get sick leave and who have to work multiple jobs. And that's a very clear example of how the neoliberal labor market norms became integral to the spread of the virus.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Pandemic impacts exacerbate inequality</h2>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="An illustration of the virus that causes COVID-19" height="200" src="images/covid-200.jpg" width="200"/>
<figcaption>An illustration of a coronavirus.&#160;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also argues that neoliberalism contributed to disparate pandemic impacts that deepened social inequities and vulnerabilities in societies where market rule is most advanced. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, for example, health insurance is most often linked to employment, and health care operates as a commercial enterprise, which the paper says led to wealthy, gainfully employed individuals having better access to health insurance, health facilities, providers, and health-care products during the pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, marginalized groups faced increased risk of serious illness and death. The paper points to the example of </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235282732100135X?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by new UCSC Assistant Professor of Sociology Alicia Riley, which found that the first seven months of the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately impacted mortality among Latino immigrants in California, especially those in unprotected, essential jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also contends that pharmaceutical company business models limit global vaccine access for low-income countries. Sparke and Williams describe intellectual property rights as creating &#8220;paywalls&#8221; and other obstacles to vaccine access, where wealthy countries protect the patent monopolies of pharmaceutical companies, and low-income countries are left to rely on philanthropic efforts that often fail to deliver.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparke says this pattern remains true for the COVAX campaign, administered by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, despite some extraordinarily generous gifts from individuals and foundations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When viewed together, Sparke believes the wide range of inequities produced by market-stratified societies and privatized health care during the pandemic show that the goals of public health and neoliberalism are often pointed in opposite directions.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market has been very successful at things like advancing the interest of intellectual property for firms and the profit of care homes, and those are successes in the market&#8217;s own very narrow terms, but they&#8217;re failures in moral, health, and social terms,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;There&#8217;s a tendency to present this as an area of so-called &#8216;market-failure&#8217;, but in reality, market successes are leading to huge social and health failures.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Toward a new vision for public health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparke and Williams ultimately argue that the harms of the coronavirus pandemic result from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multiple factors working together. Those factors include biological elements, like the characteristics of the virus itself, as well as other vulnerability-producing social forces, such as racism. But they can also stem from market-made social inequalities produced by neoliberalism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looking back through history, this pandemic is not the only example of disease enabled by neoliberalism, and we also don&#8217;t think this will be the end of it,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;But we do hope that it would be helpful for the pandemic rebuilding process if neoliberalism was at least identified as part of the problem.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

As managers and supervisors, we all share a responsibility to ensure our employees are compliant with the policy. This communication, in conjunction with the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/covid-19-resources/covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055190000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mAEco8ba7JWUWljtZMcZq" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/covid-19-resources/covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID Vaccine Policy FAQs</a>, provides an overview of processes that UC Santa Cruz will implement to ensure policy compliance by all employees.</p>
<p>All <i>unvaccinated</i> staff employees who come on-site to any University location for any reason are required to test at least every four (4) days. This testing cadence applies to all staff employees, irrespective of the frequency in which employees are physically present at a University location or when they are representing a University program for work, research, or education/training related purposes.</p>
<p>Beginning Tuesday, November 30, 2021, your employee(s) who are required to test will receive an email notification every two (2) weeks regarding their next scheduled test due date, which you will be copied on as the direct supervisor. <strong><i>If the due date on the notification has already passed and the employee has been reporting to work, this indicates that the employee is not in compliance and is overdue for asymptomatic testing.</i></strong></p>
<p>If an employee is overdue for their testing, immediate action should be taken to ensure the employee becomes compliant. Please direct your employees who are required to test to become immediately compliant by testing, and direct them to maintain their regular asymptomatic testing schedule every four (4) days. Employees should be provided with paid release time (up to 2 hours) and it is the responsibility of each supervisor/manager to ensure that employees are testing pursuant to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055190000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2PbVsESux7qDZsBkTes1cp" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">testing candance</a> of at least every four (4) days.</p>
<p>We hope these communications will assist you and your staff employees to ensure compliance with testing requirements on a regular basis. Similar to the Daily Symptom Checker compliance process, we will be providing managers and supervisors with an outline of an established disciplinary process for testing compliance in the coming weeks. Should you have employees who are not following the testing requirements, please reach out to your <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055190000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IpSD0Szkumg52N5N5ylbh" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Employee Relations Analyst</a> to discuss how to address non-compliance.</p>
<p>Additionally, SHR Employee Relations will be conducting routine audits for compliance of staff employees who are required to undergo asymptomatic testing and will notify you of non-compliant employee(s), as applicable.</p>
<p>We appreciate your attention to this important matter. Thank you for doing your part to ensure compliance with our campus&#8217;s asymptomatic COVID-19 testing requirements and helping our campus community.</p>

<h2>Reducing COVID risk while away from campus</h2>
<p>We have been successful this quarter in mitigating the spread of COVID in our campus community. Our seven-day positivity rate among students and employees has been extremely low since classes started, with a small uptick shortly after Halloween. Our seven-day rate as of this morning was 0.49 percent, nearly three times lower than the Santa Cruz County rate.</p>
<p>Many students and employees plan to visit with family and friends over the fall break, Nov. 25-28. Because there is heightened risk for COVID infection when traveling or gathering in large groups, we ask that you take some basic precautions. Wear a face covering while in an airport, on a plane or using other forms of public transportation, or when you're around unvaccinated or immuno-compromised family members if you are gathering indoors.</p>
<p>Booster shots will be especially important as we move into the winter months and anticipate the possibility of another surge. I recommend that you take advantage of any opportunity to receive your booster. Federal and California health officials last week updated public-health guidelines to say that essentially all adults are recommended to get the additional vaccinations. A <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/thanksgiving-break-travel.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cCBUPFdt5Jb52rXQltOtQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/thanksgiving-break-travel.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus message</a> that went out earlier this month included some general COVID guidance. It's worth reading again if you're heading out of town or even if you're staying put.</p>
<p>And, if you haven't already done so, please get your flu shot. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/flu-vaccination-mandate.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hC8r9Ostruw5jjhsfJVRc" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/flu-vaccination-mandate.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC has made it mandatory</a> for students, faculty, other academic appointees, and staff who learn, live, or work at a UC location.

<h2>Lecturers and UC reach tentative agreement</h2>

Their dedication and service to our teaching mission, especially over the past 20 months, are greatly appreciated. Bargaining unit members will vote on the tentative agreement, which runs until March 2026, within the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>Slug supporters stepped up on Giving Day</h2>

Giving Day has become an important vehicle for student groups to raise funds, but it is more than that. It strengthens our engagement and connections with our broader community of alumni, parents, supporters, and employees. It also builds camaraderie as we all work together to advance the institution.</p>
<p>The new Giving Day website was amazing, and I had fun watching the tally inch up all day and into the night. The U.S. map showing where all the donations were coming from in real time was a great touch. Thank you to all involved for your hard work and creativity in making Giving Day so successful. I can hardly wait to see what we will be able to achieve through Giving Day next year.</p>
<h2>Looking to add more housing at Kresge</h2>
<p><img alt="An aerial view of the construction at Kresge College, November 19, 2021" class="CToWUd a6T" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_ekxMQgdgHTLO49uIP6dxzsiQSLLMpq-ZUzruu6QDL-LUTaW3tQLutrW4mYH3pmEMNNMj5O5ASAD7QKji6sq3yUGgiugUTWd5oeSY-waza3A7XADs-If_6zExCkoJ63dgtLhgBvftQLju3-rhTX3DWQmcVL8Mb7ij4ssnx-pr4pl4lOIf57qnxEi7OSow3QzgpkEvQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/ucsc/image/upload/c_scale,w_1060/v1637688544/Content/20211119-Kresge-College-construction-NEG-001.jpg" tabindex="0"/> <em>An aerial view of the construction at Kresge College, November 19, 2021</em></p>
<p>We have been hard at work on our Kresge College renovation since the start of the pandemic. The project adds new academic, student-support and residential space, both by renovating existing structures and adding new ones. The first phase, now underway, includes the construction of three residential halls and a new academic center with multiple classrooms.</p>
<p>We shared a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov21/f8.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rsYxkGd3t4g4IiIgL9GoP" href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov21/f8.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new vision for the second phase of the Kresge College project</a> with Regents last week. This plan would benefit from the site investment campus has already made, deliver additional housing, and maximize the opportunity for state funding to help address the student-housing challenge we face. The expanded scope includes about 320 additional beds over what we had initially envisioned, with the project now totaling 870 beds.</p>
<h2>John R. Lewis College moving closer to reality</h2>
<p>My last campus update hit inboxes a few days before the momentous news that College Ten would be named in honor of civil rights leader John R. Lewis. The glow of that day has not dimmed. I know by your notes, emails, social-media posts and kind words that our entire campus community is excited for the next steps in this journey. We aim to formally change the name of the physical spaces on campus this spring &#8212; the official dedication ceremony is still being planned &#8212; but things are happening now, too!</p>
<p>The college's annual <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://practicalactivism.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pUFWIfol8OH6Wkkge_FcF" href="https://practicalactivism.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Practical Activism Conference</a> (PAC), now in its 19th year, takes on special meaning this academic year, as it exemplifies the mission and values of John R. Lewis: It is student led and centered; brings in community voices and expertise; links the local to the global; celebrates people&#039;s intersectional identities; and is committed to catalyzing collective efforts for social justice. The conference offers attendees information, tools, and opportunities to enact positive change on a variety of social-justice issues. This year&#039;s PAC takes place 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 26. Workshop topics include Voting Rights, BIPOC Mental Health, Refugee Health Care, Critical Race Theory, Native American Land Stewardship, Homelessness and Housing Justice, and Worker Exploitation in the Fashion Industry.</p>
<p>The conference allows us to collectively deepen our understanding of the life and legacy of John R. Lewis and his commitment to social justice and community, a commitment we strive to manifest each and every day. As additional events and celebrations are finalized, they will be shared on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://collegeten.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637788055210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p97yWZX0b2XXTvXyR6lr2" href="https://collegeten.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">College Ten/John R. Lewis College website</a> &#8212; please stay tuned!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the short break, and that you are able to connect with family or friends or do whatever it is that helps you to recharge. It's important that we take the time to care for ourselves and to recognize and appreciate the many joys, both large and small, in our lives.</p>

<p>Estimada comunidad del campus:</p>
<p>A medida que nos acercamos al final del trimestre de oto&#241;o, quiero extenderles mis mejores deseos a todos los <em>Banana Slugs</em>, cercanos y lejanos, y expresarles mi gratitud por la forma en que Uds. han hecho posible este trimestre. Todos en la UC Santa Cruz han trabajado incansablemente para asegurar un regreso seguro a la ense&#241;anza, el aprendizaje, la vida y las investigaciones en persona. Estoy tremendamente agradecida de que nuestro a&#241;o escolar haya transcurrido como lo ha hecho hasta la fecha, con logros dignos de mencionar &#8212; John R. Lewis College &#8212; y el lanzamiento de nuevas iniciativas encaminadas a asegurar que todos nuestros estudiantes tengan acceso por completo a la amplia gama de oportunidades proporcionadas por nuestra incre&#237;ble universidad.</p>
<h2>Los puntos principales</h2>
<ul>
<li>Precauciones a tomar si viaja durante el receso de oto&#241;o</li>
<li>Foro sobre la normativa de todo el sistema respecto a la conducta abusiva e intimidaci&#243;n en los centros de trabajo</li>
<li>Conferenciantes, acuerdo tentativo de la UC en cuanto a un nuevo contrato</li>
<li>Proeza de los <em>Slugs</em> contribuyentes en el D&#237;a de Donaciones</li>
<li>Se vislumbran m&#225;s viviendas estudiantiles en Kresge</li>
<li>Pr&#243;ximos pasos en la transformaci&#243;n de College Ten a John R. Lewis College</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reduzca el riesgo de COVID mientras est&#233; fuera del campus</h2>
<p>Hemos logrado un &#233;xito este trimestre al mitigar el contagio del COVID en la comunidad de nuestro campus. Nuestra tasa de positividad cada siete d&#237;as entre estudiantes y empleados ha sido extremadamente baja desde el comienzo de las clases, con una ligera alza despu&#233;s de Halloween. Nuestra tasa de siete d&#237;as en la ma&#241;ana de hoy era del 0.49 por ciento, casi tres veces m&#225;s baja que la tasa del Condado Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Muchos estudiantes y empleados planean visitar a sus familiares y amistades durante el receso de oto&#241;o, del 25 al 28 de noviembre. Como el viajar o las reuniones de grupos nutridos conllevan un riesgo mayor de contraer una infecci&#243;n del COVID, les pedimos a Uds. que tomen las debidas precauciones. C&#250;brase el rostro en los aeropuertos y aviones u otros medios de transporte p&#250;blico, o incluso cuando est&#233; entre familiares no vacunados o con impedimentos inmunol&#243;gicos, si se re&#250;nen bajo techo.</p>
<p>Las inyecciones de refuerzo ser&#225;n especialmente importantes en los meses de invierno que se aproximan y se prev&#233; la posibilidad de otro brote. Les recomiendo que aprovechen cualquier oportunidad de recibir una inyecci&#243;n de refuerzo.

<p>Hemos estado trabajando con ah&#237;nco en la renovaci&#243;n de nuestro Colegio Kresge desde el comienzo de la pandemia. El proyecto a&#241;ade nuevo apoyo acad&#233;mico-estudiantil y espacio residencial, gracias a la renovaci&#243;n de estructuras existentes y la a&#241;adidura de otras nuevas. La primera fase, actualmente en curso, incluye la construcci&#243;n de tres secciones residenciales y un nuevo centro acad&#233;mico con m&#250;ltiples aulas.</p>
<p>La semana pasada compartimos una nueva visi&#243;n del proyecto del Colegio Kresge con los Regentes. Este plan se beneficiar&#237;a con la inversi&#243;n ya hecha por el campus en el sitio, al aportar viviendas adicionales, y maximizar la oportunidad de aplicar fondos estatales para lidiar con el reto de vivienda estudiantil que enfrentamos. El alcance ampliado incluye unas 320 camas m&#225;s de las que originalmente planteamos, con lo cual el proyecto ahora alcanza un total de 870 camas.</p>

Lewis. El resplandor de ese d&#237;a no ha mermado. Yo s&#233;, por sus notas. <em>emails</em>, publicaciones en medios sociales y palabras amables, que toda nuestra comunidad del campus est&#225; emocionada por los nuevos pasos de esta jornada.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> honors this heritage in a 40-acre garden filled with native plants. The </span><a href="https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/education/relearning-program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amah Mutsun Relearning Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founded in 2009, gives tribal members and university students a chance to get up close to plants the ancestors interacted with regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people before first contact were very effective at stewarding and taking care of Mother Earth,&#8221; said Valentin Lopez, chair of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band. &#8220;Those plants represent thousands of years of care and tending and intentional stewardship.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relearning Program presents educational gatherings about everything from how to make acorn mush to how to turn grass seed into foods and make fires, said Rick Flores, the program&#8217;s steward and a UC Santa Cruz alum who attended College Eight (now Rachel Carson College) as an undergrad and earned bachelor's (1997) and master's degrees (2017) in environmental studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most events have been suspended since the COVID-19 pandemic, Flores has continued to give lectures through Zoom, offer tours to undergraduates and community organizations, and assist with connecting faculty to the tribe. He hopes to start up onsite programs again this spring or summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants in the garden came from a list given to the Arboretum by the Amah Mutsun. Tribe members selected plants that are culturally important, such as white root sedge and deergrass, which were used to make watertight cooking baskets, Flores said. Tribe members are invited to tend or harvest as they like.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relearning Program also uses information from Smithsonian ethnographer John P. Harrington&#8217;s extensive interviews with revered tribal elder Ascension Solorsano just before her death. According to Gilroy&#8217;s </span><a href="https://asms.gilroyunified.org/our-school/ascencion-solorsano-story"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ascension Solorsano Middle School website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Solarsano was happy to share her knowledge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are a vehicle of God,&#8221; she said, according to the web site, &#8220;that comes to see me in the 11th hour to save my knowledge from being lost. I will teach you up to the last day I can and see if I can tell you all that I know.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores said Solarsano&#8217;s interviews are a treasured resource. &#8220;She left an incredible body of cultural knowledge,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that the Amah Mutsun figured out ways to sustain the ecosystems and cultivate plant populations so they could rely on them year after year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They weren&#8217;t domesticating plants, they weren&#8217;t farming, but they were cultivating plants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a type of proto-agriculture.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amah Mutsun knew a lot about plant medicines, but you won&#8217;t hear about them from the Relearning Program. The tribe has specifically asked the Arboretum not to talk about that because of the potential dangers. The medicines are complicated&#8212;their uses and effectiveness depend on several factors like where the plant is growing, what light it gets, what kind of soil it is growing in, and what prayers are said at harvesting time, Flores said. The tribe doesn&#8217;t think that information should be shared with the public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amah Mutsun tribe has 800 enrolled members who are descendants of Indigenous groups taken to Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Juan Bautista during the times of Spanish colonization on the coast. Often referred to as &#8220;Ohlone,&#8221; they came from many bands, villages, and communities that had similar languages and intermarried and traded with each other.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, most of the tribe&#8217;s members do not live in the area anymore. Back in the early 1900s, there was a large movement of tribal members into the Central Valley to work on farms and ranches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;re a poor tribe and they are not federally recognized,&#8221; Flores said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.amahmutsunlandtrust.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amah Mutsun Land Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the vehicle the tribe uses to collaborate with environmental organizations and public, state, and federal land owners so they can gain access to their traditional territories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez, the chair of the tribe, said he appreciates the partnership with UC Santa Cruz as a way to preserve valuable Indigenous knowledge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Indigenous people of the area have been ignored and forgotten,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People don&#8217;t know who they were.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tribe members, every plant is a relative, Lopez said. Humans and plants have the same parents&#8212;Mother Earth and Father Sky.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to treat [plants] with kindness and love, sing to them, and have relationships with them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People do not do that these days and they don&#8217;t understand that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native California plants are special because they develop deep root systems that are 15 to 20 feet deep, Lopez said. This makes them resistant to drought, flooding, and disease.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you look at climate change, these are the plants that are important,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez enjoys going to the garden when he can to harvest plants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a good relationship with the Arboretum,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are one of the first ones we established a relationship with. Because of that, we&#8217;ve maintained a close relationship ever since. We collaborate on a lot of things.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4efc35b9807270462612537ce6929905"><name>avc-ppdo-cobb</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tony Cobb brings lessons from the hardscrabble to key leadership role</title><summary>At an early age, Tony Cobb learned to pay attention to details and give his all—skills he's brought to UC Santa Cruz as the new associate vice chancellor for Physical Planning, Development and Operations. </summary><start-date>1637654400000</start-date><display-name>Campus leader</display-name><path>/2021/11/avc-ppdo-cobb</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/avc-ppdo-cobb</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1637707691429</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1638380369083</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Matthew Renda</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tony-cobb-500px.jpg</name><display-name>tony-cobb-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>211255</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Tony Cobb portrait</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tony-cobb-80px.jpg</name><display-name>tony-cobb-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15211</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tony Cobb portrait</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>As a leader, Tony Cobb said his goal is to see employees succeed and thrive in the jobs.&#160;(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Tony Cobb has been grinding since he was just a child, growing up in eastern Virginia and the greater Washington D.C. area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started pushing a lawnmower and a weedeater when I was 8 or nine years old,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;I was working for my dad and my uncle with their landscaping business. And I learned from the beginning that you have to be detailed and you have to go all out.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lesson Cobb carries with him as he takes over as associate vice chancellor for the Office of Physical Planning, Operations and Development at UC Santa Cruz &#8211; a job that encompasses the oversight of all planning, design and development on the campus and its other locations in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am already heavily involved with my team members to understand the magnitude of all these different projects on campus, whether its housing or maintenance,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;The one thing I have noticed is the passion that people have for their jobs here at UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s planning for future student housing, overseeing the physical planning and operations, or finding ways to help employees professionally develop, Cobb is in charge of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m boots on the ground,&#8221; Cobb says, as he continues to tour the campus.</p>
<p>Cobb says UCSC&#8217;s location in the hills and amid the redwoods creates new challenges, but he says he will continue to refine processes and approaches as he takes over the helm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most unique campuses I have ever been on in a good way,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re intent on finding the right processes. Facilities have traditionally been viewed as different from the academic side of the institution, but our goal is to be looking at these issues through the same lens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobb will also lean on his roster of project managers, as he oversees five direct reports and about 400 total employees in the planning, design, maintenance and operations phase of the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to see other people succeed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m a life-long learner and I am dedicated to continued professional development, but at this point in my life, it brings me more joy to see others thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobb knows the importance of mentorship.</p>
<p>Early on in his career, he transitioned from working at his dad&#8217;s landscaping business to facility maintenance for a hotel chain on the East Coast. He was learning the intricacies of how utilities, HVAC, plumbing and electrical components of large buildings interact. After gaining competency in all components of maintenance requirements he moved to Oklahoma to take a similar maintenance job with Oklahoma State University.</p>
<p>There he met his wife of 18 years, who was studying for her degree at the time. The couple has since had a daughter, who currently attends Howard University, a historically black research university located in the Washington D.C. area.</p>
<p>After a couple of years, Cobb was getting ready to move back to Virginia when his friend Sean Rains called him with a job offer to work in the Oklahoma State University Athletic Department on facilities and maintenance. For a young man who was also an avid sports fan, the opportunity was once in a lifetime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to travel with the football team, and build a bond with the coaches and staff,&#8221; Cobb says. He was eventually promoted to assistant athletic director of facilities and was in charge of engineering, the HVAC infrastructure, custodial, a suite of subcontractors, events staff and keeping the athletic fields and courts in top condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoyed that time very much,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He also received critical guidance from mentors, one of whom encouraged him to take a job as the facilities manager for the Tulsa Community College.</p>
<p>While the step back in institutional prestige was a risk from a career standpoint, the large step up in responsibility, paved the way for Cobb&#8217;s gradual but steady ascension to his current position with UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in charge of operating an entire campus and I really wanted that experience,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He parlayed that experience into a job with Notre Dame, overseeing their research facility which presented a host of logistical challenges that also provided a foundation for his current role.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was able to expand my knowledge about the unique needs of research facilities, whether it was utility requirements or certain types of flooring for buildings where experiments were carried out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Also Notre Dame allowed me to oversee every aspect of facilities management, including designing and implementing my own policies around safety and infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there Cobb ventured onto Stanford, where the pandemic made his new job difficult but rewarding. Firmly established on the West Coast, Cobb is now looking forward to guiding development, renovation, planning and maintenance on UC Santa Cruz for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came from the bottom, where I was cutting grass and digging ditches to lay utilities,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I had people pulling my hand and guiding me and it&#8217;s my turn to return the favor. I just really love teamwork and bringing out the best in people.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/11/images/tony-cobb-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tony-cobb-featured.jpg</name><display-name>tony-cobb-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>20635</file-size><width>590</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Tony Cobb</thumb-alt><title>Tony Cobb: Building Team Confidence</title><description>Tony Cobb, new associate vice chancellor for the Office of Physical Planning, Operations and Development, started at the bottom—cutting grass and digging ditches—and worked his way up.

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to receive this NEH grant, which allows us to continue our community outreach work despite the financial uncertainties of the pandemic,&#8221; says Ren&#233;e Fox, co-director of the Dickens Project and PI on the grant. &#8220;Our programming in 2022 is focused on questions of race and social justice in the 19th century and today, so support from the NEH for these programs is particularly meaningful to us."</p>
<p>The NEH grant will be used to sustain a busy 2022 for the Dickens Project. Next summer will see the return of The <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/index.html">Dickens Universe</a>, a week-long cultural event that combines aspects of a scholarly conference, a festival, a book club, and summer camp, all focused on a pair of novels from the 19th century: Dickens&#8217; 1850 work <em>David Copperfield</em>, and Frances E.W. Harper&#8217;s 1892&#160;<em>Iola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted</em>, one of the first novels published by a female African-American writer.</p>
<p>In years&#8217; past, the Dickens Universe has concentrated on one Dickens novel or a pair of books by British authors, but in 2022 the Universe broadens its purview by pairing a British novel with an African-American novel. Pairing these two novels will help participants expand their understanding of 19th-century culture and will invite conversations about race both in 19th-century&#160;fiction&#160;and in our current era.The immersive Universe experience, taking place throughout the UC Santa Cruz campus, will include discussions of the books, performances, film screenings, and more.</p>
<p>In addition, the Dickens Project will be resuming two high school programs in 2022, both of which were impacted by the ongoing pandemic. One program serves students in a partnership with the Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI) program at Foshay Learning Center in South Los Angeles. At the end of the school year, the Dickens Project brings four students and two NAI instructors to the Dickens Universe to share in the learning and enjoy the event.</p>
<p>The other program, <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/programs/dayofwriting/index.html">A Dickens Day of Writing</a>, combines lesson plans and an essay-writing event for Santa Cruz County high schools in order to help students reflect on social issues in their communities via 19th-century literature. Working with teachers in Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, the program uses Dickens&#8217;s essay &#8220;Night Walks&#8221; to spark discussion on the issues of houselessness and poverty in Santa Cruz. The ongoing class discussions and writing assignments will culminate in a Day of Writing that brings together participating students and the Dickens Project community for a day of essay-writing and mentorship. Winning essay writers and their teachers will be awarded scholarships to the 2022 Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across its 41-year history, the Dickens Project has always been devoted both to scholarly research and to community engagement,&#8221; says John Jordan, director of the Dickens Project. &#8220;The programs we&#8217;ve organized for 2022 will introduce many new readers to the world of 19th-century literature, and we&#8217;re excited by the ways the Project is expanding."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="53dda26f807270462612537ced4cf3fe"><name>eloise-pickard-smith-exhibit-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Honoring a remarkable woman</title><summary>A special on-campus exhibit commemorates the life, activism, and art of Eloise Pickard Smith, highlighting her many achievements, including the California Prisons Art Project.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit, now being held at the </span><a href="https://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith-gallery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on campus, runs until December 11. Bringing together artifacts that tell the story of her involvement in art, her personal and family life, and her many professional accomplishments, the exhibit, &#8220;A Remarkable Woman: Eloise Pickard Smith,&#8221; captures the range of Smith&#8217;s insights and interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallery curator Tauna Coulson&#8217;s most important goal for this exhibit is to inspire UCSC students with Smith&#8217;s story.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted them to see what one person achieved with her voice," Coulson said. &#8220;To me this is the most important part about the exhibit&#8212;about teaching through art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coulson was referring to one of Smith&#8217;s most memorable achievements&#8212;the California Prisons Arts Project, providing prisoners access to art education and materials, and, in Smith&#8217;s words, giving them the benefit of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;that mysterious life-enhancing process we call the arts, a realm in which patient application and vivid imagination so often produce magic.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prison art project is now run by the William James Association, which loaned several pieces of artwork for display at the gallery.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting this exhibit together was a learning experience for Coulson.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t truly aware of just how much she did for anyone in her path, how much energy she poured forth in making art accessible to everyone and especially those who had the toughest time in having any exposure to art, including prison populations,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What also surprised me was her sheer tenacity in bettering the university and the community at large."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith's work in providing art access to prison populations foreshadows the important scholarship currently unfolding at UC Santa Cruz about incarceration and social justice. An ongoing public scholarship initiative called Visualizing Abolition, undertaken through the UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences, is designed to foster creative research and to shift the social attachment to prisons through art and education. It recently </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/mellon-visualizing-abolition.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received a nearly $2 million grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who spend some time at the Eloise Pickard Smith exhibit will get a strong sense of her charisma and lasting influence.&#160; &#8220;The exhibit evokes the whole person,&#8221; Coulson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gallery space has examples of her artwork, her dining room, ephemera, a timeline of her life, and quotes on the walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This idea is the brainchild of Cowell College Provost Alan Christy, an associate professor of history at UCSC and co-director of the Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit touches on Smith&#8217;s many interests&#8212;she was, among other things, an accomplished gardener, and the mother of four children&#8212;while paying attention to her life and work as an activist. Smith helped stop a nuclear power plant that was proposed for an area just north of Davenport in the early 1970s, setting off an impassioned community debate and the formation of citizens' groups that rallied in opposition to the massive project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that successful opposition, &#8220;Eloise Pickard Smith went door to door, she went to all the people with money, attended meetings in Sacramento&#8212;unstoppable,&#8221; Coulson said. &#8220;She created fliers and hand delivered them in all the mailboxes on how the plant would destroy the environment and how dangerous a proposition it was. I researched through online news archives and happened across one article that has her image front and center along with the bumper stickers she had made. Where does anyone find her energy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith also had a long history with UC Santa Cruz that precedes its opening in 1965.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When it comes to sustainability, it takes every member of the UC Santa Cruz community to make an achievement like this possible. Banana slugs&#8212;take a moment to give yourselves a pat on the back!&#8221; said Elida Erickson, director of the Sustainability Office. &#8220;We can combat the impacts of climate change by building upon our prior achievements to tackle more challenging issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton Review evaluates schools based on institutional data as well as a 10-question student survey that focuses on whether students have a quality of life that is healthy and sustainable; how well a school prepares students for jobs in a green economy, and whether the school&#8217;s policies are environmentally responsible. Nearly 840 schools were reviewed for the 12th annual Green Colleges list.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guided by its current </span><a href="https://sustainabilityplan.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Sustainability Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, UC Santa Cruz is advancing its green practices by focusing on four areas: Learning &amp; Culture; Materials Management &amp; Food Systems; Natural Environment &amp; Infrastructure; and Climate &amp; Energy. Each area includes specific goals, strategies, and actions to help move the campus forward.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz made </span><a href="https://sustainabilityreport.ucop.edu/locations/uc-santa-cruz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major advances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward meeting the systemwide 2025 carbon neutrality goal this year with the completion of a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/solar-array-parking.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-megawatt solar parking canopy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the East Remote Parking Lot. The array is increasing the campus&#8217;s use of renewable energy while reducing its energy bill. It will generate enough energy to meet about 6% of the total campus electrical load.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Campus Sustainability Plan calls on UC Santa Cruz to develop a plan to add four megawatts of solar photovoltaic to the campus and the new solar array gets the campus halfway to that goal. The Office of Physical Planning, Development and Operations is currently assessing the opportunities for solar at UCSC&#8217;s Westside Research Park and Monterey Bay Education Science and Technology (MBEST) Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus also continued to make strides in its efforts to use alternative transportation methods and support the use of electric vehicles in 2020. Almost half of UCSC employees use alternative community methods to get to work.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Strengthening an inclusive culture of sustainability</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Learning &amp; Culture section of the Campus Sustainability Plan in 2017 was the first of its kind in the UC system to start addressing the intersections of diversity, sustainability, and student success with goals to advance &#8220;</span><a href="https://pocsc.ucsc.edu/about/inclusive-sustainability.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive Sustainability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; a concept co-authored by </span><a href="https://pocsc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of Color Sustainability Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PoCSC), a collaboration of the Ethnic Resource Centers, Sustainability Office, and Colleges Nine and Ten (soon to be John R. Lewis College).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multiple award-winning PoCSC was most recently recognized as a </span><a href="https://www.aashe.org/news/meet-the-2021-sustainability-award-finalists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finalist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) Racial Equity &amp; Sustainability Collaborations award. UCSC is also featured in AASHE&#8217;s 2021&#160; </span><a href="https://www.aashe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RESJ-2021-Anthology-Essay-7.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No Sustainability Without Justice" essay series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, and students also have many opportunities to broaden their understanding of sustainability and its intersections with social justice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson College is the home of a minor in Sustainability Studies, designed for students who want to work in the sustainability field, pursue green entrepreneurships and startups, and become agents of the change needed to protect the environment in an equitable and effective way. The minor is highly interdisciplinary, and open to all UCSC students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/engage/Sustainability%20Certificate%20Program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability Certificate Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created by the Office of Sustainability, allows faculty, staff, and graduate students to examine sustainability through multiple lenses and develop knowledge and strategies for building a more inclusive and sustainable campus. To earn the certificate, participants must complete the five core courses and one elective within two academic years. More than 100 people have earned their certificate since the program launched in 2018.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Planning for a resilient future</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017-22 Campus Sustainability Plan will be updated by 2023, offering the campus new opportunities to raise the bar for sustainability. In the meantime, the campus will focus on developing non-potable water sources, continuing to reduce the campus&#8217; carbon footprint, and building operational resilience in the face of the new climate realities our community is facing.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7195eeda807270462612537c1860e06e"><name>support-for-undocumented-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Support for undocumented members of our campus community</title><summary>We are writing to reaffirm our care and support for undocumented members of our community. </summary><start-date>1638172800000</start-date><display-name>Support for undocumented members of our campus community</display-name><path>/2021/11/support-for-undocumented-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/support-for-undocumented-community</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1638288191128</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1638288191128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are writing to reaffirm our care and support for undocumented members of our community. Your contributions to our campus make UC Santa Cruz a richer and more vibrant place. Our campus is built on a foundation of social justice, and equal access to education and employment is a mainstay of that foundation. Our Principles of Community clearly lay out our commitment: We value the strength that the diversity of our campus community brings to our institution. We believe deeply in equal opportunity.</p>
<p>The University of California system is equally committed to the rights of all students and employees, regardless of immigration status, and it's important that these rights are widely known. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D201720180AB21&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638374333009000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ytzccja7_hPXy2KCnMecw" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 21</a> (AB21) was signed into law in 2017 and asks the University of California to provide access to higher education for every student regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is committed to educational access and personal success, and the campus provides an array of support services for our undocumented students, staff and faculty. The campus continues to maintain a designated point of contact and a response team for undergraduate and graduate students, staff and faculty (including academic appointees) who are or may be subject to an immigration order on campus.</p>
<p>Below, we've outlined various scenarios, and what to do in each instance.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are advised that an immigration officer is expected to enter, will enter, or has entered the campus to execute an immigration order, notify Garrett Naiman, Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Development and Engagement and Dean of Students, as soon as possible. Contact him at 831-502-5009 (available at this number after regular business hours) or via email at <a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Any student, faculty, or staff who has contact with an immigration officer executing a federal immigration order should refer that individual to our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lex.ucsc.edu/who-we-are/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638374333009000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0QaIuyjcBChVDpVhghCN5G" href="https://lex.ucsc.edu/who-we-are/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Campus Counsel's Office</a> for purposes of verifying the legality of any warrant, court order, or subpoena. Contact the office at 831-459-1848.</li>
<li>If you are or believe you may be subject to an immigration order or inquiry on campus, Garrett Naiman is again your best contact. Federal and state education privacy laws protect your records, and he is prohibited from disclosing your education information including immigration status to anyone, except as otherwise required by law. Contact him at 831-502-5009 (available at this number after regular business hours) or via email at <a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a> .</li>

<p>Apoyo a los miembros indocumentados de nuestra comunidad del campus</p>
<p>Les estamos escribiendo para reafirmar nuestra atenci&#243;n y apoyo a los miembros indocumentados de nuestra comunidad. Sus contribuciones a nuestro campus hacen de la UC Santa Cruz un lugar m&#225;s enriquecido y vibrante. Nuestro campus se ha construido sobre cimientos de justicia social y la igualdad de acceso a la educaci&#243;n y empleo es un pilar de esos cimientos. Nuestros Principios de Comunidad plantean a las claras ese compromiso: Valoramos la fortaleza que trae la diversidad de nuestro campus a nuestra instituci&#243;n. Creemos profundamente en la igualdad de oportunidades.</p>
<p>El sistema de la Universidad de California est&#225; comprometido por igual a los derechos de todos sus estudiantes y empleados, sea cual fuere su estatus inmigratorio, y es importante que esos derechos sean ampliamente reconocidos. El <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D201720180AB21&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638374333009000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ytzccja7_hPXy2KCnMecw" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proyecto de Ley de la Asamblea 21</a> (AB21) se promulg&#243; como ley en 2017 y en &#233;l se pide a la Universidad de California dar acceso a la ense&#241;anza superior a todo estudiante sea cual fuere su estatus inmigratorio.</p>

<p>Es importante tener en cuenta que las agencias de inmigraci&#243;n federales pueden entrar, y en algunas ocasiones poco frecuentes entran, a los campus en actividades ajenas a la aplicaci&#243;n de leyes, y esas actividades pudieran ser con fines de reclutamiento o tr&#225;mites de visado normales. Los procedimientos arriba detallados solo aplican a las actividades de cumplimento de leyes.</p>
<p>Reconocemos la vulnerabilidad de los miembros indocumentados de nuestra comunidad, y queremos continuar apoy&#225;ndolos a la vez que abogamos por una reforma inmigratoria humana y global.</p>

Pine as Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Engagement. Pine will lead a team that will build the strategic direction, organizational design, and long-term goals for alumni engagement, collaborating with the Alumni Association, colleagues in University Relations, and partners throughout the campus. Campus aims to provide a dynamic environment in which our 140,000-plus alumni are thoughtfully engaged and stewarded, yielding a life-long relationship with their alma mater, said Mark Delos Reyes Davis, Vice Chancellor for University Relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pine comes to campus from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) in the United Arab Emirates, where he is Director of Alumni Relations and Annual Giving. There, he established NYU Abu Dhabi&#8217;s first comprehensive Alumni Relations and Annual Giving strategic plan. Before that he was Director of Alumni Outreach, Events and Programs at NYU&#8217;s Office of Alumni Relations in New York City, and Associate Director of Alumni Relations at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University in Atlanta. He earned his master&#8217;s in college student affairs administration from the University of Georgia, and his undergraduate degree in communication from Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;John brings significant experience working with university and alumni leadership, identifying institutional priorities surrounding alumni engagement, and building the infrastructure needed to pursue them,&#8221; Davis said.&#8221; Everyone with whom he met in the hiring process noted his energy, understanding of and passion for the mission of UC Santa Cruz."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pine is expected to join campus in February, but will work with UR leadership between now and then to continue to recruit for the Alumni Engagement team.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="72d73edd807270462612537c2728306e"><name>priya-mehta-development</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Priya Mehta to serve as Associate Vice Chancellor for Development</title><summary>The Associate Vice Chancellor for Development is a pivotal leadership role on campus, and involves working at the highest levels internally and externally to generate philanthropic support for the university. &#13;

She is expected to join campus at the start of the new year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Vice Chancellor for Development is a pivotal leadership role on campus, and involves working at the highest levels internally and externally to generate philanthropic support for the university. Mehta will be responsible for &#8212; individually and through the managing of the development team &#8212; cultivating long-term donor relationships. She will serve as a principal strategist for leadership and major gifts and oversee Divisional Development staff embedded in the five academic divisions; Planned Giving; and Central Development including regional and campus initiatives. She will also serve as Vice President of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, Mehta has served as Assistant Dean, Strategy and External Relations, at UC Berkeley&#8217;s School of Public Health. There, she has been responsible for strategic planning and oversight of priority initiatives, as well as advancement, alumni relations, and events. For a number of years she also managed marketing and communications, completing a brand overhaul, full website redesign, and creative campaign for the school's 75th anniversary. The school is currently on track to exceed its $200 million fundraising goal as part of Berkeley&#8217;s $6 billion campaign. Previous to that, she was Director of Global Markets for BIO Ventures for Global Health in San Francisco. She earned her master&#8217;s in Business Administration from UC Berkeley&#8217;s Haas School of Business, and her bachelor&#8217;s in Government from Harvard University.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will succeed Jeff Shilling, who left UC Santa Cruz earlier this fall for another position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout the interview process, Priya quickly engendered the respect and trust from the university&#8217;s many stakeholders who had the opportunity to meet with her,&#8221; said Mark Delos Reyes Davis, Vice Chancellor for University Relations. &#8220;She brings with her not only the philanthropic experience needed to successfully serve in this role, but equally important a lens on how philanthropy can move an organization forward. She will be an extraordinary thought-partner to leadership, team members and donors alike as we continue in earnest our planning for&#160; our next comprehensive campaign, expected in the next few years."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78070b5e807270462612537c28e66f52"><name>grad-town-hall-housing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate student housing town hall</title><summary>I continue to work alongside campus leaders to find other sources of support for graduate students, including for summer. </summary><start-date>1637222400000</start-date><display-name>Graduate student housing town hall</display-name><path>/2021/11/grad-town-hall-housing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/11/grad-town-hall-housing</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1638396267341</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1638396267341</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear graduate students,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your letters outlining and documenting your struggles in Santa Cruz and at UC Santa Cruz. It saddens me that you feel the university does not care about you, your health or your work. All of us, including the administration, are dedicated to helping graduate students thrive, and we all believe in the transformative effect of higher education. Our campus has experienced the most challenging two years in its history and our region continues to be impacted by the wildfires, the pandemic, and the overarching issue of affordable housing. Amid so much tragedy and continuing challenges, everyone is trying to do their best.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please believe that I and the rest of the academic leadership are eager to work with you to navigate these difficult times. The $2,500 housing supplement and the </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/enhanced-programs/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial support measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unveiled this year do not solve the underlying problem of a lack of affordable housing in Santa Cruz and on campus. However, I continue to work alongside campus leaders to find other sources of support for graduate students, including for summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I want to work with you and the community to begin to find short and long-term solutions. As a next concrete step, I am organizing a graduate student town hall on housing. The idea is to bring us all together to discuss the issues, look at the data and listen to experts and practitioners to help us explore strategies and options. I&#8217;d like to work with you on this and I&#8217;m hoping to get suggestions from you, from the Graduate Student Association, and from the Graduate Student Commons to help assemble a panel of campus and community leaders and students, along with experts, to help guide the discussion on this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please send me any recommendations you have for panelists. I will also strive to ensure that you can submit questions to the panel ahead of time and during the townhall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s time to both broaden the discussion surrounding student housing and find new solutions for UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to hearing from you and to working together on this with you.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the best,<br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
