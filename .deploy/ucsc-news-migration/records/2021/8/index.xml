The Switzer Foundation selects a nationwide cohort of 20 environmental leaders each year and provides fellowship awardees with funding for their research and studies, along with networking and professional development opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m ecstatic and feeling really grateful that they chose me as one of their fellows,&#8221; Fu said. &#8220;I think what I'm most excited about is that they really pride themselves in creating a community, so I'm looking forward to connecting with the current cohort and some of the past alumni who have gone on to do great things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fu applied for the fellowship program based on the strength of her professional experience, leadership capability, and commitment to the environmental field, as well as her pursuit of important research interests through her capstone project for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Coastal Science and Policy Program. Each master&#8217;s student spends the final year of the program embedded with a partner organization to implement a co-designed scalable solution to a coastal sustainability challenge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her capstone project, Fu will be working with two organizations. She&#8217;ll help the UC Climate Resilience and Adaptation Initiative to synthesize climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans from cities and counties across the state, and she&#8217;ll apply what she learns to community engagement initiatives for the San Francisco Estuary Partnership (SFEP).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her role with SFEP, Fu will start by managing a boater education and outreach program to decrease untreated sewage discharge from recreational boaters in the Lower and Upper San Francisco Estuaries. Then she&#8217;ll pivot to engaging tribal groups and historically disadvantaged local communities in development efforts for the San Francisco Estuary Blueprint, a five-year comprehensive conservation management plan that includes responses to projected sea level rise and other elements of climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fu is an educator, critical race scholar, and cultural worker as well as an environmental advocate, and she sees climate adaptation planning as an important means of supporting the frontline communities that bear the brunt of climate change impacts. Low-income communities of color are often disproportionately affected due to past systemic racism in policymaking. But Fu hopes the future could be different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can use this really pivotal moment in urban planning to redress some of the past injustices that cities have done to undermine and underserve certain communities,&#8221; Fu said. &#8220;We can look at climate adaptation not just as an environmental issue, but also as an issue that incorporates things like transportation equity, racial equity, and housing; all of these facets of society that people don't often think of as relating to climate change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fu believes that addressing the major challenges the world faces today will require solutions that advance both social and environmental goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For a long time in the environmental field, there was never really a focus on the people and communities that rely on natural resources, but now I think the field is really turning a page, and I hope to take my career in a direction that makes this field more equitable,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I'm passionate about the environment, but I'm just as passionate about people.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08fa484b807270466cc00b00fc018d21"><name>face-coverings-guidance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New guidance for wearing face coverings on campus</title><summary>To advance the health and wellness of our campus community, we are now requiring that individuals, regardless of vaccination status, wear face coverings when they are in indoor settings at campus locations.</summary><start-date>1627887600000</start-date><display-name>New guidance for wearing face coverings on campus</display-name><path>/2021/08/face-coverings-guidance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/face-coverings-guidance</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1627943225399</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662577204868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>To advance the health and wellness of our campus community, we are now requiring that individuals, regardless of vaccination status, wear face coverings when they are in indoor settings at campus locations.</p>

<p>This change comes as pandemic conditions continue to change across our state and region. Last week, in light of the spreading Delta variant, the federal Centers for Disease Control updated some of its <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628020911079000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxkiUGjwDftAr-Yy5D_g9u5hGvpA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guidance for fully vaccinated people</a>. The CDC suggests that fully vaccinated people should wear a mask in public indoor settings if they are in an area of substantial or high-transmission risk in order to reduce the risk of becoming infected with the Delta variant and potentially spreading it to others. The CDC has <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/%23county-view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628020911079000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHayI8B6vURWF43DvNJ3yzWQWpImQ" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published a map</a> where you can track the level of transmission by state and county. Santa Cruz County, as well as Santa Clara County, where our Silicon Valley Campus is located, are both categorized as having substantial levels of community transmission as of this week.</p>
<p>Over the past 16 months, our campus community has demonstrated care, adaptability and resilience.

Sanford and Dr. Dinesh Rao at UCLA are co-principal investigators on the grant, which will provide more than $3 million over five years for their research.</p>
<p>Sanford and Rao, who have been friends since they met in college, have been collaborating for several years to investigate aggressive forms of leukemia that remain highly resistant to treatment. Their recent studies have shown that one determinant of the aggressive behavior of leukemia is an RNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression. The new grant supports their ongoing research to investigate the function of this RNA-binding protein, called IGF2BP3, in the initiation and maintenance of leukemia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Protein-RNA interactions are fundamental to the inner working of our cells,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;The expression of all genetic information is controlled through a network of protein-RNA interactions. When this network is disrupted, myriad human diseases, including cancer, can occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01346-7">published July 29 in <em>Leukemia</em></a>, Sanford and Rao&#8217;s team presented new evidence for IGF2BP3 as an attractive target for novel therapies to treat leukemia. The researchers showed that deletion of the gene for IGF2BP3 significantly increases the survival of mice with a type of leukemia in which the RNA-binding protein is over-expressed. In addition, they found that mice lacking the protein developed normally, suggesting that blocking the protein would not have serious side effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Importantly, IGF2BP3 goes rogue in a variety of other cancers,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;We anticipate that our work on IGF2BP3 will have broad impacts on cancer biology, diagnostics, and future therapies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanford noted that the preliminary research supporting their proposal for the new grant was funded by smaller grants from the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group and the UC Cancer Research Coordinating Committee.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0df96314807270466cc00b006073a3f0"><name>covid-19-info-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 information forum set for Aug. 13</title><summary>The next UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 Information Forum is scheduled for Friday, Aug. 13 from 9:30 a.m. — 11 a.m.</summary><start-date>1628026500000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 information forum</display-name><path>/2021/08/covid-19-info-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/covid-19-info-forum</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1628027052801</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662577244383</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The next UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 Information&#160;<span>Forum</span> is scheduled for Friday, Aug. 13 from 9:30 a.m. &#8212; 11 a.m.</p>

These are painful times for many, even though our campus is not directly affected by the current fires. <br/> <br/>We were lucky last year in that the CZU fire stopped short of our campus, but so many in the UC Santa Cruz and greater Santa Cruz County communities were not as fortunate. The fire burned more than 86,000 acres and destroyed an estimated 1,000 homes in our county alone. One man was killed while trying to escape the flames. The CZU Lightning Complex wildfire forever changed the lives of thousands of people, including many affiliated with our campus, and they are on my mind as we find ourselves in another dry fire season.<br/> <br/>The COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, has complicated recovery for many. A suddenly huge demand for construction work coupled with a shortage of building materials has sent construction prices skyrocketing. I am hearing from local officials that many people have rebuild permits in hand, but are waiting to see if they can still afford to move forward. That is heartbreaking and extends the trauma that so many experienced. <br/> <br/>I am also reminded, though, of the many incredible displays of kindness, perseverance and resilience that we witnessed last year, especially during the emergency evacuation of our campus. Amid so much uncertainty and loss, it was inspiring to see our community come together to help each other. I remain deeply appreciative of all who supported our students and colleagues through this time last year &#8212; our wonderful staff members, area first-responders, local businesses, city and county government officials, and the leaders of colleges and universities throughout the region who reached out with offers of assistance as soon as they saw our predicament.<br/> <br/>I remain heartened by the tremendous response we saw to the disaster-relief fund established in the aftermath of the CZU fire by our University Relations team and championed by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and our Alumni Association. Donations could be directed toward students or employees. All told, more than $150,000 was raised for, and quickly distributed to, dozens in our campus community deeply impacted by the fire to help them pay for food, shelter, clothing, rent payments, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and assistance with repairs for damaged homes. <br/> <br/>Being located in an area where there is significant fire risk is something our campus has always dealt with, but that reality was brought home last year. Know that we are doing all we can to make our campus fire-safe. We actively work with city and county officials to mitigate risks and coordinate response. We have a strong, ongoing partnership with Cal Fire. The agency is very invested in the campus and surrounding community, and last month we renewed a 10-year agreement with Cal Fire for vegetation management. We also maintain our fire roads and a hydrant system in North Campus, and continue to use and maintain the fire breaks established on campus by Cal Fire during the CZU fires. <br/> <br/>Our campus also has robust wildfire awareness and preparedness educational programs for students, staff and faculty, and this fall our Office of Emergency Services will release a new emergency-preparedness app for students and in-person trainings for staff and faculty to continue to educate our community about wildfire risks and campus response. <br/> <br/>Thank you for your commitment to each other. Last year was a difficult one. We faced both the pandemic and the fire, but we persevered by sticking together and caring for one another. That&#8217;s how we made it through the hard times and how we&#8217;ll continue to move forward into what I know is a bright future for UC Santa Cruz. Stay well, stay safe, and stay connected.<br/> <br/>Cindy <br/> <br/>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d9371cb807270466cc00b0021db0b3f"><name>aging-brain</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Five-year NIH grant supports collaborative research into rejuvenating the aging brain</title><summary>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, and Stanford are working together to discover and treat the causes behind age-associated cognitive decline.</summary><keywords>Yi Zuo</keywords><start-date>1628492400000</start-date><display-name>Five-year NIH grant supports collaborative research into rejuvenating the aging brain</display-name><path>/2021/08/aging-brain</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/aging-brain</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1628288807354</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1628521166461</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Erin Malsbury</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/yi-zuo-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/yi-zuo-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yi-zuo-375.jpg</name><display-name>yi-zuo-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>84431</file-size><width>375</width><height>392</height></image><image-alt>Yi Zuo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/yi-zuo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/yi-zuo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yi-zuo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>yi-zuo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17425</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Yi Zuo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Neuroscientist Yi Zuo is studying how the brain changes with age.

<p>As we grow old, inflammation in our brains can become excessive. In low amounts, this inflammation acts as a helpful immune response, but too much can impair cognitive function and lead to declines in processes like memory.</p>
<p>Researchers at UCSC, UC Berkeley and Stanford are working together to find and neutralize the factors that cause these declines, using mice as models. They&#8217;re looking specifically at changes to blood composition and how immune cells in the brain and central nervous system called microglia alter cognition with age.</p>
<p>Lead investigator Yi Zuo, a professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC, said she never expected to study aging as part of her neuroscience work. &#8220;But maybe because I'm getting older, my parents are getting older&#8230;, I have more and more people whose real lives are affected by aging,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Zuo&#8217;s lab specializes in the study of synapses&#8212;gaps between nerve cells that electrical or chemical signals jump across. The synaptic connections allow us to think, move, and feel. Altering them changes the brain&#8217;s abilities.</p>
<p>The scientists hypothesize that as we age, chronic inflammation leads to microglia destroying important synapses. To combat this process, they designed a treatment consisting of the hormone oxytocin and an inhibitor for an inflammatory pathway. The team will watch how the cocktail affects the brain over time as well as look for differences in the way the blood of old and young mice impacts inflammation.</p>
<p>In addition to studying changes in synapses and inflammation, Zuo will also measure behavioral shifts in the mice, testing processes like memory. The length of the grant will allow the team to examine these physical and behavioral results over multiple years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We typically are looking at what happens to experimental animals or human subjects very quickly after the intervention,&#8221; said Irina Conboy, a professor of bioengineering at UC Berkeley. &#8220;But we don't know what happens long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some parameters cannot be expected to change immediately, she explained. She used networks of neurons in the brain as an example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you are improving something quickly, it takes some time for the brain rewiring to catch up and result in a better cognitive response,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Conboy&#8217;s lab brings to the group a specialization in aging and blood-based rejuvenation research. She and Zuo will be joined by Philippe Mourrain, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. Neuroscientists often examine individual or small groups of synapses. Mourrain&#8217;s lab designs ways to study the big picture of neural processing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brain has 200 billion neurons in the neocortex,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That would be like 300 trillion synaptic connections. Some would say it's like the equivalent of 2,000 Milky Ways, where you need to understand every single star as its own microprocessor but also in connections with all the others as part of a network.&#8221;</p>
<p>For this project, the group will use an imaging technique called array tomography to observe huge numbers of individual synapses. His lab will &#8220;investigate this constellation of connections,&#8221; and identify how it changes with treatment.</p>
<p>As Mourrain&#8217;s group studies the larger picture, Zuo&#8217;s lab will focus on individual synapses and microglial cells. They will track real-time changes in single animals over hours, days, months, and eventually, years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very difficult to piece together the information by a snapshot,&#8221; said Zuo. &#8220;This will give us a continual dynamic view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scientists expect their treatments to result in a long-term decrease in inflammation and an increase in cognitive function. In previous studies, Zuo and Conboy have seen success with this treatment in the short-term, and this project will help them determine exactly how it works over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>The team also plans to identify specific factors that change in the blood with age and cause chronic inflammation. Once they tease apart the specific mechanism, they hope to design another treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we identify what the young blood can bring into the brain, then we don't need the young blood itself,&#8221; said Zuo. &#8220;Maybe something can be purified to synthesize that and bring it into the brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collaboration of the three labs will include meetings and workshops for sharing techniques.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m greatly excited about the collaborative work&#8212;that it really cross-pollinates innovative technologies of the three laboratories,&#8221; said Conboy. &#8220;They synergize. Each professor alone would not be able to accomplish that work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mourrain agrees. &#8220;I really, really enjoy this collaboration,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel very good about it, because the intervention has already been proven to work. And all the tools that we are using, whether in Yi's lab, Irina&#8217;s, or in mine, we've validated them over the past 10 years. So we can just move forward now.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1dba8a22807270466cc00b00da5d68a2"><name>fostering-antiracism</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fostering anti-racism in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology </title><summary>A UCSC team has assembled a toolkit of resources for academic departments to use in addressing issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</summary><keywords>Melissa Cronin, Erika Zavaleta</keywords><start-date>1628521200000</start-date><display-name>Fostering anti-racism in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology </display-name><path>/2021/08/fostering-antiracism</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/fostering-antiracism</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1628291369487</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1628521276827</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/cronin-zavaleta-440.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/cronin-zavaleta-440.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cronin-zavaleta-440.jpg</name><display-name>cronin-zavaleta-440.jpg</display-name><file-size>86901</file-size><width>440</width><height>262</height></image><image-alt>Melissa Cronin and Erika Zavaleta</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/zavaleta-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/zavaleta-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zavaleta-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>zavaleta-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21972</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Erika Zavaleta</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Melissa Cronin (left) and Erika Zavaleta (right) led efforts to compile an easily accessible set of resources for departments wanting to address historic and current inequities in their fields.

A diverse group of faculty, staff, and students in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at UC Santa Cruz has now compiled a set of tools and strategies which departments can use to address shortcomings in equity and inclusion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01522-z">Published August 9 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em></a>, the recommendations are based on a review of the literature in an effort to identify evidence-based interventions for fostering anti-racism in the classroom, within research labs, and department-wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing novel in our recommendations. These are empirically-based approaches developed by people who study these issues, and we&#8217;ve put them all in one place and tailored them for the disciplines of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology,&#8221; said first author Melissa Cronin, a Ph.D. candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>Cronin said she and senior author Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, saw a growing need for an easily accessible set of resources to help departments wanting to address historic and current inequities in their fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is greater awareness now, and a lot more departments are thinking about how to address these issues, so we thought this would be a helpful contribution,&#8221; Cronin said. &#8220;This paper is not a perfect response to the systemic racism we see in scientific life today, but we hope it is a useful tool for those scientists and departments looking to take action at the local level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paper addresses the problematic histories of racist policies and ideas in the fields of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology, such as the use of pseudoscientific interpretations of evolutionary biology to advance eugenics and racist ideologies. These historic legacies have contributed to racial gaps by discouraging BIPOC participation in those fields.</p>
<p>Cronin noted that, while people of color are underrepresented in science generally, the gaps are even greater in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. &#8220;Underrepresented groups are even more underrepresented in these disciplines than in other areas of science, so these disciplines are a high priority,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Cronin and Zavaleta recruited a diverse group of students, faculty, and staff within their department to work on the paper, which has 26 coauthors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really positive and constructive experience for our department to work together on this paper,&#8221; Cronin said. &#8220;And we built on this incredibly rich tradition of scholarship at UC Santa Cruz in critical race studies, a field which historically has not always intersected with the STEM fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>The department has already implemented many of the recommendations in the paper and has established an <a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/idea_committee.html">Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (IDEA)</a> committee to support its commitment to these goals.</p>
<p>Zavaleta has long been active in addressing these issues and was recognized earlier this year by the Ecological Society of America with its 2021 Commitment to Human Diversity in Ecology Award. At UCSC, she directs the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a> and the <a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/">Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-Based Opportunities (CAMINO)</a>, both designed to overcome barriers to participation by historically excluded groups in ecology and conservation biology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1de1716d807270466cc00b00749427d6"><name>back-up-care-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing new subsidized back-up care program for employees and students</title><summary>The need for back-up care — both child care and elder care — is critical for our employees and students.

In 2020, the campus Family Services Workgroup surveyed employees and students, and back-up care was identified as an urgent need. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the importance of having this important support structure in place.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that this fall, UC Santa Cruz will start providing subsidized back-up care for employees and students. This will include both in-home care and care at one of the child-care centers that will be in a care network now being assembled. Bright Horizons will operate the back-up care program, and is now engaging in-home care providers and centers across the region to be part of the network UCSC employees and students can utilize.</p>
<p>Each eligible employee and student who registers for the program will be allotted 15 uses per year. Employees and students will be responsible for a copay per use, and campus will cover the rest of the cost. The copay per use for employees will be $10 per child, or $15 per family, for center-based back-up care, and $4 per hour for in-home care (for up to 10 hours/day for up to three children). The copay per use for students will be $5 per child, or $10 per family, for center-based back-up care and $2 per hour for in-home care.</p>
<p>Since the care is provided at a cost less than the market rate for these services, the difference between the market rate and the copay is treated by the IRS as additional income, also known as imputed income, and is taxable. The employee or student who has used the back-up care program is required to pay taxes on the imputed income.</p>
<p>As implementation continues, we will provide information on how you can register for the program. Our goal is to have the program in operation by the first day of fall quarter. Information on other family services offered to employees and students can be found online:</p>

In Elkhorn Slough, these vulnerabilities are made worse by superabundant crabs found at their highest densities along the estuary&#8217;s tidal creeks, according to a new study <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.3703">published August 8 in <em>Ecosphere</em></a>.</p>
<p>The striped shore crab <em>(Pachygrapsus crassipes)</em> is a small crab found all along the West Coast of North America, and it is extremely abundant in Elkhorn Slough. The study demonstrated the dual role of these crabs as both consumers of salt marsh vegetation and as ecosystem engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their burrowing weakens the creekbank edges, so that whole chunks of marsh will sometimes calve off, and by lowering biomass they are reducing the ability of marsh plants to prevent erosion,&#8221; said lead author Kathryn Beheshti, who earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2021 and is currently a California Sea Grant State Fellow at the Ocean Protection Council&#8217;s Climate Change Program.</p>
<p>Beheshti and her coauthors conducted a five-year field experiment to assess the effects of crabs on the vegetation and sediments along eroding creekbank edges. Using fencing and traps made of empty tennis-ball cans to exclude crabs from experimental enclosures, they found that reducing crab abundance led to increased growth of salt marsh vegetation and enhanced sediment density.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that the number of burrows did not change over the study period, even with researchers experimentally removing crabs. The unexpected persistence of the burrows highlights the value of long-term field experiments. The experiment was maintained for five years thanks in large part to the efforts of a team of over 50 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students and high school interns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Field experiments that span multiple seasons and years are rare,&#8221; said coauthor Kerstin Wasson, research coordinator of the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and an adjunct professor at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This work demonstrates the value of long-term studies by showing that burrows, which weaken the stability of tidal creek banks, persist despite the near absence of the crabs that build them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Brent Hughes, assistant professor at Sonoma State University, noted that the crabs were most abundant in spring and summer, when the pickleweed marshes are at peak production. &#8220;This synchrony suggests that the effect of crabs as consumers is more punctuated than their more chronic effect as engineers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Elkhorn Slough is one of the largest estuaries in California, with the largest tract of tidal salt marsh in the state outside of San Francisco Bay. It has been highly altered by human activities, however, and erosion along the edges of the tidal creeks and main channel is steadily eating away at the marsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big issue, because when the marsh erodes away along the tidal creeks it&#8217;s a permanent loss,&#8221; Beheshti said.</p>
<p>The impacts of crabs on marsh biomass and soil structure near tidal creek banks are likely to make the marsh less resilient to erosion and sea-level rise, presenting a unique challenge to managers. Restoring populations of crab predators, such as herons, racoons, and sea otters, may be one way to mitigate these negative effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this system, top-predator recovery is key,&#8221; said coauthor Brian Silliman, distinguished professor at Duke University.</p>
<p>This collaborative study brought together marsh ecologists from both the East and West Coasts who have led the field in exploring how animals affect the marshes they inhabit. Over the past few decades, the U.S. East Coast has been the epicenter of studies exploring top-down effects in salt marshes, and this study is one of the few to explore such effects in a West Coast salt marsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Southeastern U.S. marshes appear to be a harbinger of what&#8217;s to come for marshes along the Pacific coast, with sea-level rise amplifying the effects of what would otherwise be considered an innocuous crab,&#8221; said coauthor Christine Angelini, associate professor at University of Florida.</p>
<p>The authors called for similar long-term studies to be conducted in other West Coast marsh systems to determine how widespread these crab effects are. &#8220;It&#8217;d be great for contextualizing our findings,&#8221; Beheshti said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to know if Elkhorn Slough is the canary in the coal mine, signaling yet another pathway for accelerated marsh edge loss for one of California's rarest coastal habitats.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Esther Ngan-ling Chow and Mareyjoyce Green Dissertation Scholarship will provide Villalobos with $18,000 in funding, which she plans to use as compensation for research participants and to help cover travel-related expenses. The award supports women and non-binary scholars from underrepresented groups whose work is in service of women of color.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Villalobos is pursuing a doctoral degree in sociology with a designated emphasis in Latin American and Latino studies. Her dissertation research will compile an ethnography inspired by her own experience of growing up in the Central Valley community of Parlier, California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Villalobos is the proud daughter of a single mother who immigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador and spent more than 30 years working in the agricultural industry. The ethnography project will feature interviews with young participants from similar family backgrounds, in order to explore how rural spaces influence identity formation for Latina girls in rural California. Villalobos will also examine the relationship between spatial and social mobility, looking to explore how internal migration from rural to urban contexts shapes upward mobility for girls of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I ultimately want to enhance the lives of these girls and the broader communities they come from because I saw how much inequality and disparity there was growing up,&#8221; Villalobos said. &#8220;I was often the exception in being able to go to a four-year university, or to be here today as a person in graduate school, so I'm interested in looking at who gets to leave these typically very poor rural communities and who stays.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Villalobos says girls of color within the U.S. have a unique perspective on the challenges of rural environments, yet their stories often go untold. Rural regions in the U.S. are more often conceptualized in terms of Appalachia or the rural South, with a focus on white, conservative, working-class communities. But these portrayals miss how diverse and heterogeneous many rural spaces in the U.S. actually are. And while women and girls of color are frequently studied in rural settings in the Global South, there&#8217;s typically less focus on the issues they face domestically.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Central Valley is a region that produces billions of dollars of wealth through agricultural business, and yet the labor force is living in poverty,&#8221; Villalobos said. &#8220;Where are the stories of the girls of color who grew up in these spaces, and what can they tell us about what's going on in this country in terms of immigration and migration and the exploitation of the working class, particularly how that&#8217;s feminized and racialized?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documenting these stories will require building deep trust with girls in the Central Valley and utilizing research methods that position participants as collaborators. As part of this process, Villalobos is returning to the communities that shaped her own youth and observing daily life through a new critical lens. She says the experience has been a mix of both positive emotions and unsettling but important revelations.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looking at the places we call home in this way is a very personal and difficult task, because you have to come face-to-face with the things that shaped you, and oftentimes those things aren't always positive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But there are both challenges and beauty in these places.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3098a2e9807270466cc00b00f7a1d361"><name>advancing-faculty-diversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two new grants support faculty diversity and retention</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz was awarded grants from the University of California to support two collaborative multi-campus projects for advancing faculty diversity. </summary><keywords>Herbie Lee, Megan Moodie</keywords><start-date>1628578800000</start-date><display-name>Two new grants support faculty diversity and retention</display-name><path>/2021/08/advancing-faculty-diversity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/advancing-faculty-diversity</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1628607914711</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1628608230161</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Arts</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens &amp; Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/herbie-lee-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/herbie-lee-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>herbie-lee-250.jpg</name><display-name>herbie-lee-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>34470</file-size><width>400</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Herbie Lee</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/herbie-lee-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/herbie-lee-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>herbie-lee-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>herbie-lee-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18561</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Herbie Lee</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Herbert Lee is Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and the campus diversity officer for faculty. (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz was awarded grants from the University of California to support two collaborative multi-campus projects for advancing faculty diversity. One project involves the creation of an Equity Advocate Program at UC Santa Cruz, while the other will examine the impact of course evaluation systems at several campuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;These grants are part of a series of projects that have been funded from the UC Office of the President&#8217;s program for Advancing Faculty Diversity, focusing on both recruitment and retention,&#8221; said Herbert Lee, vice provost for Academic Affairs and the campus diversity officer for faculty.</p>
<p>Lee is a principal investigator of one project, a collaboration with UC Riverside and UC Davis to look at potential bias in student surveys of teaching. He said a large body of research has documented that the numerical scores in course evaluations tend to be biased against women and faculty of color, but the narrative component of the surveys has not received the same attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project will use data science to analyze the text of the student comments to see if bias also shows up there,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Throughout higher education, student evaluations are one of the primary tools for evaluating teaching effectiveness, so if there are biases, we want to document it and take that into account somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee, a professor of statistics in the Baskin School of Engineering, and the other principal investigators&#8212;Vice Provost Daniel Jeske at UC Riverside and Vice Provost Philip Kass at UC Davis&#8212;are all statistical scientists. &#8220;Daniel Jeske had the idea that we can use statistical modeling and machine learning to analyze this,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>The project will also evaluate the effects of recent changes to the survey questions used at UC Santa Cruz. The campus&#8217;s new Student Experiences of Teaching survey focuses the questions on student self-reflection in an effort to have students think about their own learning and how the instructor and course design may have helped or inhibited their learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to know if those changes made a difference. If it reduced bias, then it&#8217;s something that can be replicated on other campuses,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;The big picture is that we want to see that all faculty have a chance to succeed and that there aren&#8217;t hidden barriers and implicit biases against certain groups of faculty.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Equity Advocates</h2>
<p>Overall, supporting equitable outcomes for faculty requires both innovation and long-term commitment, starting with the hiring process and continuing over the course of a career. This is the goal of the second collaborative multi-campus project for advancing faculty diversity granted to UCSC. It aims at creating an Equity Advocates Program at UC Santa Cruz that will empower strong champions of this work and provide dedicated resources.</p>
<p>Two faculty Equity Advocates per academic division will receive specialized training and a course release in order to advise on hiring processes, analyze tenure and promotion rates within departments, provide formal and informal faculty mentoring, and assist with other needs related to faculty equity and inclusion</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Anthropology Megan Moodie, who led the development of the project proposal, said that the idea sprung from a <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu/afd-workgroup-merced/index.html">prior Advancing Faculty Diversity collaboration</a> with UC Merced, through which a committee of faculty from both campuses worked to synthesize and apply research on best-practices in inclusive hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program is coming out of the hard work of last year&#8217;s committee and our conversations about proactive steps to create more equitable faculty hiring and retention outcomes, not just nice rhetoric and language around it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The whole idea of an Equity Advocate is to have someone where the rubber meets the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Merced has an existing Equity Advocates program in place, as do many other UC campuses, but at Merced, the new project will expand the role beyond the initial hiring process. UC Santa Cruz and UC Merced currently have the most racially diverse professoriates in the system, but substantial disparities in representation remain between faculty, the student base, and the state&#8217;s overall population.</p>
<p>The Equity Advocates Program will help to deliver continued improvements in representation and will provide crucial formal recognition, support, and compensation for faculty equity leaders at UC Santa Cruz. Many faculty of color have previously been filling aspects of the role invisibly, according to <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/0/245/files/2021/06/Covarrubias-Quinteros_FOC-Leadership_Under-Review.pdf">research</a> by Associate Professor of Psychology Rebecca Covarrubias.</p>
<p>Recruitment for faculty Equity Advocates is scheduled to start in winter of 2022, following the completion of training program development in collaboration with UC Merced.</p>
UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s proposal development team for this project included Professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Needhi Bhalla, Professor of Psychology Jean E. Fox Tree, Associate Professor of Anthropology Megan Moodie, and Professor of Literature Juan Poblete. Bhalla, Fox Tree, Poblete, and Professor of Film &amp; Digital Media John Jota Lea&#241;os will lead the campus effort moving forward.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="322989e1807270466cc00b00882edac1"><name>michael-luttrell-outstanding-staff</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dedicated to keeping campus safe during COVID</title><summary>Michael Luttrell, this year’s Outstanding Staff Award winner, worked hard to keep the campus safe during a chaotic year of pandemic fears and a devastating wildfire.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Luttrell, this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award winner, worked hard to keep the campus safe during a chaotic year of pandemic fears and a devastating wildfire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luttrell is the 26th winner of the Outstanding Staff award, which was originally established by the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association in 1995, to honor a staff member who has gone &#8220;above and beyond&#8221; to provide distinguished service to students, staff and colleagues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association partners with the Staff Advisory Board to solicit nominations, choose, and honor both the nominees and the annual awardee.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luttrell maintained his focus, good humor, and resiliency even while having to move to temporary housing when last August's CZU Lightning Complex fires threatened his home in Boulder Creek.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the campus&#8217;s operations and logistics manager for COVID-19 testing on campus, Luttrell oversaw a hard-working team that administered to date close to 100,000 COVID tests for students, faculty, and staff. That operations team included 66 students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been amazing to see how resilient our student body is,&#8221; Luttrell said. &#8220;When we first started [the TestMe COVID-19 testing] initiative, I wondered if students would want to put themselves out there in the middle of a pandemic and do this kind of work. But we got a couple of hundred applications just within the first couple of days. We ended up hiring between 65 and 70 students in the past year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until very recently, the words "oversee COVID-19 testing" were nowhere to be found in Luttrell&#8217;s job description.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luttrell made a name for himself as head of operations of UC Santa Cruz Conference Services, managing programs that drew more than 10,000 visitors to campus every summer for camps, conferences, and retreats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the advent of COVID brought a temporary end to all those in-person conferences starting in the summer of 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services Jean Marie Scott reached out to College, Housing, and Educational Services&#8212;a department that includes Conference Services&#8212;to ask if staff members could help with the COVID testing effort.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that abrupt job change weren&#8217;t enough of a challenge all by itself, Luttrell also had to contend with the devastating CZU Lightning Complex fires, which spread across 86,000 acres in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. Threat of the fires </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced Luttrell, his wife, and their then 1-year-old daughter to evacuate from their Boulder Creek home for 39 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luttrell was overwhelmed by the outpouring of help and concern he received from UCSC colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was displaced for almost 40 days, people were always calling and texting," Luttrell said. "In some cases, I didn&#8217;t know they knew where I lived!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he does it&#8221;&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board (SAB) in partnership with the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association chooses honorees based on letters of recommendation on behalf of candidates&#8212;and the statements for Luttrell were unstinting in their praise for his energy, his handling of complicated logistics, and his total dedication to the campus&#8217;s well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do not know how he does it all,&#8221; one coworker wrote in a letter of recommendation. &#8220;He went from being a conference services manager to overseeing a HUGE project: getting the COVID Kiosk testing program up and running for our entire campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a site supervisor working on this project alongside him, I have appreciated his leadership, ability to remain calm, and his long-game vision,&#8221; the letter continued. &#8220;Being redeployed was a big deal for all of us. Working around lab supplies and dealing with COVID-related work was new for all of us, and it was really stressful at the beginning. Michael played a huge role in helping all of us adjust.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coworker also mentioned Luttrell's kindness and humor, and his trademark humility. That last quality came across strongly when Luttrell confessed that he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; to receive the award, and that he had, in fact, been pushing for someone else to receive the same honors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, when a member of the SAB called him to inform him that he received the award, Luttrell thought he was merely &#8220;a finalist,&#8221; until the caller clarified that he was &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finalist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was definitely humbling because I never did this work on campus in order to be recognized,&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Luttrell said. &#8220;I just want to help this community as much as possible. I want to be part of it. I want to do what I can. It&#8217;s incredible when you think of all the fully committed people on this campus&#8212;the students jumping in to help, the community rallying during the fires.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Considering the aftermath of COVID</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now with a slowing down of testing on campus, Luttrell still juggles many roles: Managing supplies and complicated supply chains; communicating with labs, higher-ups at UCSC, and student health leadership; and still supervising 60-plus students who help run the three kiosk testing sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worries about especially contagious variants, and people refusing vaccines, have raised doubts about how soon the United States can resume normal activities without fears of further dangers, shutdowns, and restrictions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Luttrell has every intention of transitioning back to his pre-COVID conference responsibilities if the opportunity arises.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Staff honorable mention awards</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association and Staff Advisory Board recognized four additional Honorable Mention winners this year, all of them working on the front lines of COVID.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They went far above and beyond to support our campus and community during a time of crisis,&#8221; the SAB said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those staff members include:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Rocio De La Cruz,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> custodial supervisor, who</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">managed constantly changing rules and procedures regarding COVID-19 safety, and also expanded cleaning services. Through her efforts, her team was available wherever and whenever they were needed;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Frank Dang</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, student health services IT lead, who was instrumental in developing the IT systems for the health center in order to continue to provide healthcare to UCSC's students during the pandemic;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Christina Lombardo,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> health and safety programs manager, who coordinated the operations of the Environmental Health and Safety department&#8217;s COVID-19 response, conducted most of the site evaluations to determine which buildings were ready for reoccupation, and led the team that developed the campus's COVID-19 Workplace Safety training module; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Michael Tassio, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief of staff for the Division of Academic Affairs and director of online education, who</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has been central to the planning of remote and online learning and played a big role in helping faculty make the transition to remote teaching.&#160;</span></li>

(Photo by JR Ancheta, UAF)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An international research team has retraced the astonishing lifetime journey of an Arctic woolly mammoth, which covered enough of the Alaska landscape during its 28 years to almost circle the Earth twice.</p>
<p>Scientists gathered unprecedented details of its life through analysis of a 17,000-year-old fossil from the University of Alaska Museum of the North. By generating and studying isotopic data in the mammoth&#8217;s tusk, they were able to match its movements and diet with isotopic maps of the region.</p>
<p>Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, led an analysis of ancient DNA preserved in the mammoth&#8217;s remains, which provided additional insight into the animal&#8217;s life and behavior.</p>
<p>Few details have been known about the lives and movements of woolly mammoths, and the study offers the first evidence that they traveled vast distances. An outline of the mammoth&#8217;s life is detailed in a paper <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6556/806">published August 12 in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not clear-cut if it was a seasonal migrator, but it covered some serious ground,&#8221; said University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Matthew Wooller, senior and co-lead author of the paper. &#8220;It visited many parts of Alaska at some point during its lifetime, which is pretty amazing when you think about how big that area is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, where Wooller is director, split the 6-foot tusk lengthwise and generated about 400,000 microscopic data points using a laser and other techniques.</p>
<p>The detailed isotope analyses they made are possible because of the way that mammoth tusks grew. Mammoths steadily added new layers on a daily basis throughout their lives. When the tusk was split lengthwise for sampling, these growth bands looked like stacked ice cream cones, offering a chronological record of an entire mammoth&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the moment they&#8217;re born until the day they die, they&#8217;ve got a diary and it&#8217;s written in their tusks,&#8221; said Pat Druckenmiller, a paleontologist and director of the UA Museum of the North. &#8220;Mother Nature doesn&#8217;t usually offer up such convenient and life-long records of an individual&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scientists knew that the mammoth died on Alaska&#8217;s North Slope above the Arctic Circle, where its remains were excavated by a team that included UAF&#8217;s Dan Mann and Pam Groves, who are among the co-authors of the study.</p>
<p>Researchers pieced together the mammoth&#8217;s journey up to that point by analyzing isotopic signatures in its tusk from the elements strontium and oxygen, which were matched with maps predicting isotope variations across Alaska. Researchers created the maps by analyzing the teeth of hundreds of small rodents from across Alaska held in the museum&#8217;s collections. The animals travel relatively small distances during their lifetimes and represent local isotope signals.</p>
<p>Using that local dataset, they mapped isotope variation across Alaska, providing a baseline to trace the mammoth movements. After taking geographic barriers into account and the average distance it traveled each week, researchers used a novel spatial modeling approach to chart the likely routes the animal took during its life.</p>
<p>Shapiro&#8217;s analysis of the mammoth&#8217;s DNA allowed the team to identify it as a male that was related to the last group of its species that lived in mainland Alaska. Those details helped researchers interpret the isotopic data. For example, an abrupt shift in the mammoth&#8217;s isotopic signature, ecology, and movement at about age 15 probably coincided with the mammoth being kicked out of its herd, mirroring a pattern seen in some modern-day male elephants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing that he was male provided a better biological context in which we could interpret the isotopic data,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>Isotopes also offered a clue about what led to the animal&#8217;s demise. Nitrogen isotopes spiked during the final winter of its life, a signal that can be a hallmark of starvation in mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just amazing what we were able to see and do with this data,&#8221; said co-lead author Clement Bataille, a researcher from the University of Ottawa who led the modeling effort in collaboration with Amy Willis at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Discovering more about the lives of extinct species satisfies more than curiosity, said Wooller, a professor in the UAF College of Fisheries and Ocean and Institute of Northern Engineering. Those details could be surprisingly relevant today as many species adapt their movement patterns and ranges with the shifting climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arctic is seeing a lot of changes now, and we can use the past to see how the future may play out for species today and in the future,&#8221; Wooller said. &#8220;Trying to solve this detective story is an example of how our planet and ecosystems react in the face of environmental change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidence of this enrichment process has been around since the 1970s, when scientists studying certain mineral inclusions in meteorites concluded that they were pristine remnants of the infant solar system and contained the decay products of short-lived radionuclides. These radioactive elements could have been blown onto the nascent solar system by a nearby exploding star (a supernova) or by the strong stellar winds from a type of massive star known as a Wolf-Rayet star.</p>
<p>The authors of the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01442-9">published August 16 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>, used multi-wavelength observations of the Ophiuchus star-forming region, including spectacular new infrared data, to reveal interactions between the clouds of star-forming gas and radionuclides produced in a nearby cluster of young stars. Their findings indicate that supernovas in the star cluster are the most likely source of short-lived radionuclides in the star-forming clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solar system was most likely formed in a giant molecular cloud together with a young stellar cluster, and one or more supernova events from some massive stars in this cluster contaminated the gas which turned into the sun and its planetary system,&#8221; said coauthor Douglas N. C. Lin, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Although this scenario has been suggested in the past, the strength of this paper is to use multi-wavelength observations and a sophisticated statistical analysis to deduce a quantitative measurement of the model&#8217;s likelihood.&#8221;</p>
<p>First author John Forbes at the Flatiron Institute&#8217;s Center for Computational Astrophysics said data from space-based gamma-ray telescopes enable the detection of gamma rays emitted by the short-lived radionuclide aluminum-26. &#8220;These are challenging observations. We can only convincingly detect it in two star-forming regions, and the best data are from the Ophiuchus complex,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Ophiuchus cloud complex contains many dense protostellar cores in various stages of star formation and protoplanetary disk development, representing the earliest stages in the formation of a planetary system. By combining imaging data in wavelengths ranging from millimeters to gamma rays, the researchers were able to visualize a flow of aluminum-26 from the nearby star cluster toward the Ophiuchus star-forming region.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enrichment process we&#8217;re seeing in Ophiuchus is consistent with what happened during the formation of the solar system 5 billion years ago,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;Once we saw this nice example of how the process might happen, we set about trying to model the nearby star cluster that produced the radionuclides we see today in gamma rays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forbes developed a model that accounts for every massive star that could have existed in this region, including its mass, age, and probability of exploding as a supernova, and incorporates the potential yields of aluminum-26 from stellar winds and supernovas. The model enabled him to determine the probabilities of different scenarios for the production of the aluminum-26 observed today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have enough information to say that there is a 59 percent chance it is due to supernovas and a 68 percent chance that it&#8217;s from multiple sources and not just one supernova,&#8221; Forbes said.</p>
<p>This type of statistical analysis assigns probabilities to scenarios that astronomers have been debating for the past 50 years, Lin noted. &#8220;This is the new direction for astronomy, to quantify the likelihood,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new findings also show that the amount of short-lived radionuclides incorporated into newly forming star systems can vary widely. &#8220;Many new star systems will be born with aluminum-26 abundances in line with our solar system, but the variation is huge&#8212;several orders of magnitude,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;This matters for the early evolution of planetary systems, since aluminum-26 is the main early heating source. More aluminum-26 probably means drier planets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The infrared data, which enabled the team to peer through dusty clouds into the heart of the star-forming complex, was obtained by coauthor Jo&#227;o Alves at the University of Vienna as part of the European Southern Observatory&#8217;s VISION survey of nearby stellar nurseries using the VISTA telescope in Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing special about Ophiuchus as a star formation region,&#8221; Alves said. &#8220;It is just a typical configuration of gas and young massive stars, so our results should be representative of the enrichment of short-lived radioactive elements in star and planet formation across the Milky Way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also used data from the European Space Agency&#8217;s (ESA) Herschel Space Observatory, the ESA&#8217;s Planck satellite, and NASA&#8217;s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="40304d57807270466cc00b00b3bb39ee"><name>provide-vaccination-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Now is the time to provide vaccination info, get vaccinated if you’ve been waiting</title><summary>The best way to confront uncertainty is through preparation, and preparing for fall quarter this year requires very specific things from our campus community.</summary><start-date>1628838000000</start-date><display-name>Now is the time to provide vaccination info, get vaccinated if you’ve been waiting</display-name><path>/2021/08/provide-vaccination-information</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/provide-vaccination-information</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1628869512513</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1628874852344</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The best way to confront uncertainty is through preparation, and preparing for fall quarter this year requires very specific things from our campus community.</p>

<p>The University of California has made COVD-19 vaccinations mandatory for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students as a condition for accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, the spike in COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths over the past month primarily in unvaccinated individuals highlights the urgent need to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage in our campus community.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to all of you who have submitted your COVID-19 vaccination record. As of Aug. 11, we have received vaccination records for roughly 53 percent of employees and 48 percent of students who are expected to be on campus this fall. <strong>We can, and must, do significantly better.</strong></p>

Frye passed away at his home in Berkeley on June 16 at the age of 82. He will be remembered as a lifelong proponent for diversity in education, a steadfast civil rights advocate, and a renowned scholar of political organizing who applied his keen sense of justice to help marginalized communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frye was born and raised in Tuskegee, Alabama, and grew up attending segregated schools, where his teachers instilled in him a strong sense of Black history, pride, and determination.&#160; After high school, he served in the military, then moved to California, where he became involved in political activism in Los Angeles and Sacramento.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frye was a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and participated in many demonstrations to support civil rights, including picketing the 1960 Democratic National Convention and sitting in at the California State Capitol to demand fair housing legislation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He served as a Field Secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Alabama and Mississippi for several years. In 1964, he joined Freedom Summer in Mississippi and worked to register Black citizens to vote, despite constant threats of police violence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young man, Frye also pursued his higher education goals with great determination, starting at Sacramento City College, then Sacramento State, and ultimately UC Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in sociology in 1975. Frye&#8217;s early research focused on community development and school-community partnerships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1976, he was appointed as an assistant professor in Yale University&#8217;s new African American Studies Program. UC Santa Cruz Professor Emeritus of Sociology John Brown Childs&#8212;who first met Frye through SNCC in 1965&#8212;was also a member of Yale&#8217;s African American Studies faculty at the time, and the pair formed a friendship.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The dynamics of that vital program were invigorated by Hardy's deep experience in his tenacious pro-democracy activism, to which he brought both scholarly acumen and great personal courage,&#8221; Childs recalled, regarding their time together at Yale.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frye left Yale after one year to become a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, where he helped form what is now the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues. He then joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1978 as an assistant professor of sociology. At UCSC, Frye was a strong advocate for students of color, particularly in helping them to navigate institutional politics, and he instilled in all of his students values of justice and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Professor of Sociology Herman Gray was a graduate student at the time and recalls studying under Frye. He was one of few professors who would regularly visit graduate student offices just to sit and chat. Gray says this demonstrated Frye&#8217;s strong sense of equity and his desire to build community and belonging for students.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hardy taught me how to lead and modeled for me how to be an activist and professor but also how to connect with people because, above all, he was a people person,&#8221; Gray said. &#8220;He was a moral center for the department.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frye was an established and successful leader within the Sociology Department throughout his time at UC Santa Cruz, recalls Distinguished Professor Emeritus G. William Domhoff, who served on the faculty with Frye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When Hardy came to UCSC, he became a leader in diversifying the Sociology Department,&#8221; Domhoff said. &#8220;His ability to put everyone at ease and to treat them as equals, and to guide people through issues to a solution, led to his being appointed an associate dean in the Social Sciences Division from 1987 to 1988, at a time when there were still relatively few African Americans in administrative positions in the University of California who had responsibilities in relation to white faculty.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frye retired from UC Santa Cruz as a professor emeritus in 1999. He also worked with the University of California Office of the President to help diversify the UC system by coordinating with community colleges. Frye later returned to UC Berkeley as a lecturer in African American Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his career, Frye often drew on the experiences of his youth to advocate for equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Frye had an uncanny skill at using his Southern-based experiences to shed light on Northern&#8212;and Western&#8212;problems generated by racial hierarchies, which contributed to his reputation as a savvy organizer,&#8221; said UCSC Professor Emeritus David Wellman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Frye&#8217;s most highly regarded pieces of research is his 1980 book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Parties and Political Power: A Case Study</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published in the Yale University research series &#8220;Perspectives on the Black World.&#8221; In the forward, UC Berkeley Professor William Kornhauser hailed the work as &#8220;a significant contribution to political sociology as well as the Black struggle.&#8221; Frye played an important role in ensuring recognition of African American contributions within sociology.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among his other notable accomplishments, Frye was the director of the Urban School Collaborative Project and served as Director of the Peace Corps in Guyana. He also spent time in South Africa after the end of apartheid to work with emerging Black political parties.

<p>St. Fleur is a reporter at <em><a href="https://www.statnews.com/">STAT</a></em>, a health and medicine news site associated with the <em>Boston Globe</em>. He received the award and its $1,000 prize for four <em>STAT</em> stories, including one in two parts:</p>

</ul>
<p>Judges said St. Fleur&#8217;s reporting covered fresh ground, particularly on topics around race, medicine and research. One judge said a story about colonoscopies was &#8220;a tender portrait&#8221; approached with &#8220;nuance, empathy and scientific savvy.&#8221; Another judge praised the work as &#8220;masterfully framed.&#8221; St. Fleur was also recognized for exploring issues of race, while being unsparing yet respectful in his storytelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UC Santa Cruz SciCom program shaped me into the science reporter I am today,&#8221; St. Fleur says. &#8220;It nurtured my curiosity and set me onto a path where I can share the humanity behind every science story. I will forever be grateful for the journalistic foundation that it has given me.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Fleur was first inspired to pursue journalism after watching medical correspondents cover the devastation of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the country where his parents were born. He came to UCSC after earning his B.S. in biology from Cornell University, where he was science editor of the <em>Cornell Daily Sun</em>. During his graduate studies in Santa Cruz, he trained as a reporter through internships at the <em>Monterey Herald</em> and the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>. After graduation, he held internships at <em>Scientific American</em> and NPR, then worked as a staff reporter at the <em>Atlantic</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>St. Fleur joined STAT as a <a href="https://wallacehouse.umich.edu/knight-wallace/">Knight Wallace Reporting Fellow</a> in September 2020. He is now both a general assignment reporter and associate editorial director of events at STAT.</p>
<p>The Clark/Payne Award was created to encourage young science writers by recognizing outstanding reporting in all fields of science. It is given each year in honor of journalist Ev Clark, who offered friendship and advice to a generation of young reporters. The award was organized this year by Richard Harris (UCSC biology B.A., 1980), who recently retired from NPR and is CASW&#8217;s treasurer. This is the 33rd year of the award.</p>
<p>Three other alumni of UCSC's SciCom Program have received the award: Richard Stone '91, senior science editor for Tangled Bank Studios at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and former international news editor at <em>Science</em>; Lila Guterman '98, deputy news editor at <em>Science</em> and former staff reporter at <em>Science News, Chemical &amp; Engineering News,</em> and the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>; and Amber Dance '08, a freelance science and health journalist in southern California and regular contributor to <em>Nature</em>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="54a9b08d807270466cc00b002d915a4e"><name>community-safety-plan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Office of President releases Community Safety Plan</title><summary>The UC Office of the President has released the final 2021 UC Community Safety Plan along with a letter from UC President Michael V.

<p>The plan was created with the aim of reimagining UC's culture, policies, and practices to create campus communities where all feel equally welcomed, respected, and protected from harm. It was developed with input from diverse groups of University of California stakeholders including Campus Safety Task Force members from each campus.</p>
<p>The UCOP plan is built on four main pillars: stressing community and service-driven safety; developing holistic, inclusive and tiered responses; prioritizing transparency and continuous improvement through data; and establishing accountability and independent review.</p>
<p>This systemwide Campus Safety Plan does not supplant the ongoing work here at UC Santa Cruz to develop a community safety framework that works for all on our campus. I believe the work being done at the system level and on our campus will help advance a welcoming and inclusive campus for our communit</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="555b2df8807270466cc00b00f696e855"><name>anthem-dignity-agreement-reached</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anthem Blue Cross &amp; Dignity Health reach agreement on continuing contract; services at Dignity, Dominican are covered as in-network expenses</title><summary>Anthem Blue Cross and Dignity Health announced on August 14, 2021 that they reached agreement on a continuing contract, and the terms of the agreement are retroactive to July 15, 2021.</summary><start-date>1629183600000</start-date><display-name>Anthem Blue Cross &amp; Dignity Health reach agreement on continuing contract; services at Dignity, Dominican are covered as in-network expenses</display-name><path>/2021/08/anthem-dignity-agreement-reached</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/anthem-dignity-agreement-reached</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1629224644051</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1629224644051</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><strong>Update: Anthem Blue Cross and Dignity Health announced on August 14, 2021 that they reached agreement on a continuing contract, and the terms of the agreement are retroactive to July 15, 2021.</strong><span> This agreement returns Dignity Health facilities to Anthem health plans, while protecting affordability for members.

That can lead to overharvesting the largest, most prolific fish that can contribute the most to the population.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/34/e2100695118">Published this week in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, the study found that better protection of larger, mature females could improve the productivity of major fisheries. This is crucial at a time when fisheries are increasingly important in providing food resources around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a fundamental question in fisheries management&#8212;how much reproduction can you count on?&#8221; said Dustin Marshall of Monash University in Australia, lead author of the research. &#8220;When you are expecting smaller females to produce the same number of eggs per body mass as larger, older females, you&#8217;re not going to have an accurate picture.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Building on Earlier Research</h3>
<p>The new research applies previous findings that questioned longtime assumptions of fisheries management. Traditional thinking held that reproduction is a function of biomass. That means that fish representing a certain mass would produce similar numbers of offspring regardless of their age or maturity. However, syntheses of previous research by some of the same authors demonstrated that larger, older, and more mature fish produce more offspring. Also, previous work suggests that offspring of these older, larger mothers may survive at higher rates.</p>
<p>"In this paper, we connect the dots between early findings that large, old Pacific rockfish produced more eggs per body mass than smaller ones did, and Professor Marshall's more recent work showing that many other species do, too," said coauthor Marc Mangel, professor emeritus of mathematical biology at UC Santa Cruz. "Without recognizing this, fisheries scientists and managers may overestimate the number of spawning fish needed to produce a certain level of recruitment, and set mortality levels from fishing too high."</p>
<p>Management measures, such as establishing Marine Protected Areas that provide refuge for fish to grow larger, can help boost the yields of fisheries and replenish depressed species. They can in effect provide a reservoir of more mature fish with greater reproductive capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to ask, &#8216;How can we make the most of these fish that reproduce more efficiently&#8212;both to sustain the species and to support sustainable fisheries?" said E.J. Dick, a fisheries research biologist at NOAA Fisheries&#8217; Southwest Fisheries Science Center and senior author of the paper.</p>
<p>By contrast, when fishing removes the more prolific larger fish, the traditional assumptions tend to overestimate the production of eggs and the population&#8217;s capacity to replenish itself. That can lead to overharvesting which for many of the largest fisheries could remove around twice as many fish as intended, the scientists found.</p>
<h3>Recognizing Greater Capacity</h3>
<p>In their new analysis, the scientists examined whether the largest fisheries in the world take the findings into account. In many cases, they found, fisheries do not.</p>
<p>&#8220;This systematic error could help to explain why some stocks have collapsed despite active management,&#8221; the scientists wrote. They recommended that managers recalibrate future species stock assessments to recognize the greater reproductive capacity of larger fish. This could reduce overharvesting and may even boost the yields of fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such reductions could have negative repercussions in the short-term, for both food security and the economy, but will yield positive benefits in the long-term,&#8221; the scientists wrote. They said that better recognizing the capacity of larger fish could help boost the catches of Atlantic cod fisheries in the longer term, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work suggests that modern management could respond to this challenge by better leveraging the reproductive potential of larger, older fish in exploited stocks more so than is presently the case, using relatively simple policy innovations,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>The project will develop a system that uses the medical imaging modalities of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), and optimizes them for imaging living plants and the area around plant roots known as the rhizosphere. Activities in the rhizosphere influence many important processes at multiple scales in the Earth system, including the global cycling of carbon. Studying the rhizosphere, however, has always been a challenge.</p>
<p>Abbaszadeh&#8217;s <a href="https://ril.soe.ucsc.edu/">Radiological Instrumentation Laboratory</a> at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering focuses on developing new imaging and sensing technologies, mostly for biomedical applications. Her collaborators on the new project include soil ecologist Weixin Cheng, professor and chair of environmental studies at UCSC, and Stanford University radiologists Adam Wang and Craig Levin.</p>
<p>Abbaszadeh said she talked to Cheng after seeing a DOE call for proposals to develop better imaging techniques for studying plants. &#8220;He told me they really need this kind of imaging tool for the rhizosphere,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting project, applying new imaging technologies to answer very interesting questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheng studies the ecology of the rhizosphere and its role in carbon and nitrogen cycles. He said the role of the rhizosphere is a crucial missing piece in understanding the cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, and terrestrial ecosystems, where large amounts of carbon are stored in soil organic matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rhizosphere is really a mystery spot in ecology,&#8221; Cheng said. &#8220;So much is unknown there because it is so difficult to study. The soil is opaque, so we can&#8217;t do what we do with ease aboveground, and if you dig and disturb the system you&#8217;re not observing anything realistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbaszadeh plans to combine her lab&#8217;s novel radiation detectors and other advanced technologies to enable a low-cost PET/CT system for plant and soil imaging. In medical imaging, PET/CT combines the excellent anatomical imaging of CT scans with the ability of PET to trace metabolic activity in the body using small amounts of radioactive material called radiotracers.</p>
<p>For plant imaging, the researchers will use carbon-11, a short-lived radioisotope of carbon, to trace the carbon that is absorbed by plants as carbon dioxide, incorporated into carbohydrates during photosynthesis, and transported into the roots. Some of that carbon enters the soil in root exudates, where it can be metabolized by soil microbes or stabilized by soil particles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that biological activity in the rhizosphere occurs in hot spots that are very dynamic,&#8221; Cheng said. &#8220;We want to be able trace this shifting constellation of hot spots and how they are influenced by the soil matrix. We also want to see how much of the carbon is being metabolized by the plant roots and how much is used by microbes in the rhizosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third question the researchers plan to address is how much of the carbon in root exudates gets stabilized by clay particles in the soil. The answers to these questions may have important implications for understanding carbon sequestration in soils and its role in the carbon cycle and climate change.</p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, the researchers will develop innovative instruments with improved capabilities, including an increase in the sensitivity of the PET system for dynamic imaging of isotopes with a short half-life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not as if PET and CT of plants has not been done before, but we are developing new technologies with better performance for capturing the plant and soil system,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="568428e2807270466cc00b00b0ad6847"><name>payroll-disclosure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Courtesy notice regarding annual systemwide payroll disclosure</title><summary>As part of the university’s commitment to transparency and public accountability, including the way it compensates faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2020. </summary><start-date>1629183600000</start-date><display-name>Courtesy notice regarding annual systemwide payroll disclosure</display-name><path>/2021/08/payroll-disclosure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/payroll-disclosure</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1629244106950</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1629244106950</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As part of the university&#8217;s commitment to transparency and public accountability, including the way it compensates faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2020.

<p><span>The 36-year-old comedian has the distinction of being nominated twice in the same category of television writing for the upcoming 2021 Primetime Emmy Awards.</span></p>
<p><span>Black was nominated for &#8220;Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series&#8221; for both <i>The Amber Ruffin Show</i> and <i>A Black Lady Sketch Show</i>. </span></p>
<p><span>She is one of only three people who have been double nominated in this category over the past five years. The other two are actor/comedian John Mulaney and late night host and former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> head writer, Seth Meyers.</span></p>
<p><span>On HBO&#8217;s <i>A Black Lady Sketch Show</i>, Black not only writes sketches, she also has a starring role as a main cast member.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The creator of that show, Robin Thede, recently told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/style/ashley-nicoleblack-emmys.html">New York Times</a><i> </i>that she sees Black as &#8220;a force of nature and of comedy,&#8221; adding: &#8220;I have been lucky enough to work with her as a writer and performer and know firsthand how ridiculously good she is at both&#8230;She&#8217;s truly a powerhouse who will leave an indelible mark on this industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>From her point of view, Black described herself to the <i>Times</i> as &#8220;someone who&#8217;s observing what&#8217;s going on in the world, and trying to reflect it back to people.&#8221; &#8220;To me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s art.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Black graduated from UC Santa Cruz</strong> in 2007 with a degree in theatre arts. She began a Ph.D program in performance studies at </span><span>Northwestern University</span><span>, but left early to begin her comedy career at the famed Second City in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span>She performed with a variety of groups at the theater, including its Diversity &amp; Outreach program, and started teaching comedy writing at The Second City Training Center. She also began performing around the city and created a showcase for her fellow up-and-coming writers and performers.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2016, Black moved to New York and spent three years as a correspondent on the TBS show, <i>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</i>, winning an Emmy in 2017 for her work on the &#8220;Not the White House Correspondents Dinner&#8221; program. Overall, she has been nominated for an Emmy eight times as a television writer for a variety special or series.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to working on both the </span><span><i>The Amber Ruffin Show</i></span><span> and </span><span><i>A Black Lady Sketch Show</i></span><span>, Black also joined the writing team for the second season of the Apple TV+ comedy series,&#160;<i>Ted Lasso</i>, which just received 20 Emmy nominations. She recently told the Hollywood news site <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/feature/ashley-nicole-black-black-lady-sketch-show-amber-ruffin-show-interview-1204367558/">Gold Derby</a> that the show&#8217;s positive spirit helped her through the height of quarantine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool because you work with people&#8212;this is true on all three of these shows&#8212;and you watch them pour their heart into something because they want to affect people,&#8221; said Black. &#8220;It&#8217;s really meaningful to see them get that love back with all the great nominations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards will take place on September 19, presented by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and CBS.</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/08/images/nicole-black-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/08/images/nicole-black-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nicole-black-featured.jpg</name><display-name>nicole-black-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>5815</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Ashley Nicole Black</thumb-alt><title>Ashley Nicole Black: Comedy Gold</title><description>Comedian Ashley Nicole Black (Porter '07, theater arts) was nominated for an Emmy Award in television writing for both The Amber Ruffin Show and A Black Lady Sketch Show, earning the distinction of being nominated twice in the same category.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5b4a4146807270466cc00b0013fe50bb"><name>matthew-raiford-book-event</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The legacy is in the soil</title><summary>Acclaimed chef/farmer and CASFS apprenticeship graduate Matthew Raiford will share his heritage-based approach to food and farming during an August 25 event on campus.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally renowned chef and farmer, &#8220;CheFarmer,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.chefarmermatthew.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Raiford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will visit UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Cowell Ranch Hay Barn on August 25 from 7:30&#8211;9 p.m. to discuss his new cookbook, </span><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781682686041/overview"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bress &#8216;n&#8217; Nyam: Gullah Geechee Recipes from a Sixth-Generation Farmer</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The book features a collection of 100 heirloom recipes that pay homage to Gullah Geechee food, an essential cuisine of American history that has nurtured Raiford&#8217;s family for seven generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raiford is a 2011 graduate of the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at UC Santa Cruz and a 2018 James Beard Foundation semifinalist for Best Chef in the Southeast. His culinary approach is inspired, in part, by his experiences farming lands passed down from his great-great-great grandfather in coastal Georgia, a region where descendants of enslaved Africans, speaking the African Creole language called Gullah Geechee, came together to make extraordinary food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I grew up eating a lot of vegetables&#8212;a lot&#8212;and then we ate a lot of fish, oysters, shrimp, low country boil,&#8221; Raiford told </span><a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/entertainment/2021/05/24/matthew-raiford-amy-condon-debut-new-cookbook-bress-n-nyam-gullah-geechee-georgia/5204570001/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savannah Now</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;So many people think that Black cooking is all ribs and chicken, but it isn&#8217;t, not in Gullah and the land I come up in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bress &#8216;n&#8217; Nyam, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which means &#8220;bless and eat&#8221; in Gullah Geechee, shares Raiford&#8217;s recipes organized by elemental beginnings. An earth section focuses on recipes anchored by grains and produce, while water, wind, nectar, and spirits highlight seafood, red meat, poultry, desserts, and cocktails, respectively. The flavors are Raiford&#8217;s own modern take on family traditions, and his recipes stem from a deeply rooted sense of place.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raiford&#8217;s connection to the land started with growing up on his family&#8217;s organic farm, </span><a href="https://www.gilliard-farms.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilliard Farms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, outside of Brunswick, Georgia.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that people shopped at the grocery store for fruits and vegetables until I was an adult because we grew everything,&#8221; he told </span><a href="https://www.southernliving.com/culture/gilliard-farms-brunswick-ga"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern Living</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I thought the store was where you went for flour and sugar, those kinds of things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After initially embarking on a military career, Raiford attended culinary school and the CASFS apprenticeship program before returning home to run the family farm with his sister, Althea. Sustainable farming practices, like those taught through CASFS apprenticeships, came naturally to him, thanks to the traditions of his Gullah Geechee heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the introduction to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bress &#8216;n&#8217; Nyam,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Raiford writes that, at CASFS he &#8220;learned about seeds, organic pest control, and food justice&#8212;all things I knew from growing up but had never considered in an academic setting.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, Raiford draws frequently upon the wisdom of his ancestors in managing Gilliard Farms. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bress &#8216;n&#8217; Nyam</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes excerpts from a collection of family letters dating back to the 1940s that document a wealth of hard-earned knowledge about what to plant and when, along with weather conditions and which crops provided best for the family.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My great-grandmother would write to my nana about what they were taking to market, what they were planting,&#8221; Raiford told </span><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bress-n-nyam"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon App&#233;tit</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I wanted to put our stories and our lived history in there. I wanted people to see our Blackness as our humanity.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bress &#8216;n&#8217; Nyam</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrates this legacy, as does Raiford&#8217;s work each day at Gilliard Farms. By applying heritage-based techniques to his stewardship of familial lands, Raiford is regenerating soils, supporting health, and preserving culture for future generations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, members of the Santa Cruz community will have a unique opportunity to learn from his work. Stacy Philpott, director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, said the center is proud to see Raiford return to campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Matthew&#8217;s passion for growing, preparing, and providing food and his commitment to community really embody so much of what CASFS works for, and it is an honor to have him back to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Philpott said.&#160;</span></p>

<p>At this time, travel will only be permitted for critical research activities. By definition, critical research activities meet these three criteria: (1) The travel is essential to the survival or long-term viability of significant research activity or academic work; (2) The research activity is a substantial component of the petitioner&#8217;s academic or professional work at UCSC; and (3) There are no viable alternatives to travel.</p>
<p>All research-related travelers, whether domestic or international, are required to review and complete the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/field-research/%23covid&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629404387120000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_n87LuOVCiOXViTnvdzoy-_d3cA" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/field-research/#covid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19 Research Travel Checklist</a> provided by the EH&amp;S Field Research Safety program. The traveler can reach out as needed to EH&amp;S at <a href="mailto:fieldsafety@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fieldsafety@ucsc.edu</a> to review the checklist or discuss trip-specific parameters. For group travel, the trip lead is responsible for reviewing and sharing the checklist with all trip participants.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic travel</strong>: Pre-approval is no longer required for domestic travel related to critical research activities. All domestic travelers outside the state of California are required to register with the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://risk.ucsc.edu/insurance/insurance-programs/travel-insurance.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629404387120000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3ITfFcT6rFf7uFuXjWDlUWgfGOA" href="https://risk.ucsc.edu/insurance/insurance-programs/travel-insurance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Travel Insurance Program</a>. For travel inside the state of California, but greater than 100 miles from campus, registration is encouraged but not required.</p>
<p><strong>International travel:</strong> <strong>As there are variable risk levels for travel to different regions of the world, pre-approval is required for all international travel.</strong></p>

<p>In partnership with UCSC&#8217;s Orientation team, the division is rolling out its brand new&#160;<a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/slug-mentor-program/index.html">Slug Mentor Network</a>. This initiative is a collaboration with&#160;<a href="https://www.mentorcollective.org/">Mentor Collective</a>, a group of forward-thinking partner institutions and mentorship scholars and institutes focused on enhancing the college experience by connecting students with a peer mentor.</p>
<p>The new&#160;Navigate App&#160;will allow students to more easily schedule appointments with staff who use Slug Success, find &#8220;Study Buddies&#8221; for their enrolled classes, view their schedule and important campus events/deadlines, and identify helpful campus resources including their assigned Academic Advisors.</p>

There&#8217;s more activity on campus with each passing day and while the fall will look different than any we have had before, I know our community will continue to show the support and patience they&#8217;ve shared with one another over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>Preparation remains the key to opening as planned and we continue to follow all COVID developments closely, particularly those involving the highly contagious Delta variant.</p>
<p>The best way to support our return is to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/provide-vaccination-information.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8Ob4lxRFtbWZ7CGK0Dl6nye9vCw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/provide-vaccination-information.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">get vaccinated and provide your proof of vaccination</a> to campus. As you know, the University of California has made compliance with its COVID-19 vaccination program mandatory for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students as a condition for accessing any UC facility this fall. The fact that the Delta variant has struck the unvaccinated especially hard demonstrates the reasoning behind that decision.</p>
<p>The Office of the President considers a fully vaccinated campus one where at least 90 percent of students, faculty and staff are fully vaccinated. It is imperative we reach that threshold by Sept. 9, which is the deadline for employees and students to submit their proof of vaccination or to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwDkiaEJ8ntkmOM10OcCW0slf4CA" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initiate a request for exception</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and have yet to upload your vaccine information, please do so now. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/uploading_proof_vaccination.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqZ7ceBqWNfbmR6jI-lNevuEzPCA" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/uploading_proof_vaccination.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instructions for employees to submit proof of vaccination are online</a>.

<h2>Michael Luttrell honored with Outstanding Staff Award</h2>
<p>Congratulations to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/michael-luttrell-outstanding-staff.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIR9dOYvW9Su3kpgNr8Cjq1OqLxw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/michael-luttrell-outstanding-staff.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Luttrell, winner of the 2021 Outstanding Staff Award</a>. The award, now in its 26th year, was established to honor staff members who go above and beyond to provide distinguished service to students, staff and colleagues. Michael did that and more, redeploying from operations manager of UCSC Conference Services and taking over as operations and logistics manager for COVID-19 testing on campus. He did so even in the face of huge personal challenges, as he was forced to relocate to temporary housing for 39 days last summer with his wife and infant daughter when the CZU Lightning Complex fires threatened his Boulder Creek home. Thank you, Michael, for your commitment to our campus community.</p>
<p>The UCSC Alumni Association partners with the Staff Advisory Board to solicit nominations, select, and honor both the nominees and the annual award winner. This past year brought such a flood of deserving nominees, four additional staffers were recognized with honorable mention awards. Not surprisingly, all of them work on the front lines of COVID. They are Rocio De La Cruz, a custodial supervisor who managed constantly changing COVID-19 rules and procedures; Frank Dang, who was instrumental in developing the IT systems needed for the health center to continue to provide student care during the pandemic; Christina Lombardo, who coordinated Environmental Health and Safety&#8217;s operational response to COVID-19; and Michael Tassio, Academic Affairs chief of staff and director of online education, who has been central to the planning of remote and online learning.</p>
<p>Congrats to all who were nominated and honored. I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary spirit and talent displayed regularly by our dedicated staff. Thank you for all of your efforts.</p>
<h2>Back-up care program coming this fall</h2>
<p>I am pleased to announce that starting this fall, UC Santa Cruz will provide <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSpnBfaho8JGfUCm5QwYGjVEx8sg" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subsidized back-up care</a> &#8212; both child care and elder care &#8212; for employees and students. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of having this support structure in place. Our program will include both in-home care and care provided through a network of child-care facilities.</p>
<p>Eligible employees and students who register for the program will be allotted 15 uses per year. Employees and students will be responsible for a copay per use, with campus covering the remainder of the cost. The copay for employees for center-based back-up care will be $10 per child, $4 per hour for in-home care. The copay for students for center-based care will be $5 per child, $2 per hour for in-home care. Additional information on the program can be found in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSpnBfaho8JGfUCm5QwYGjVEx8sg" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/back-up-care-program.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus message</a> announcing its creation.</p>
<p>More information on how to register for the program will be provided soon. Our goal is to have the program up and running by the first day of fall quarter.</p>
<h2>Face coverings required in indoor settings</h2>
<p>As pandemic conditions continue to change across our state and region, we now require that individuals, regardless of vaccination status, wear face coverings when they are in indoor settings at campus locations. A <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/face-coverings-guidance.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3nSv9reaGTxOGFeoYM6baIVF42Q" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/face-coverings-guidance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus message</a> sent earlier this month details when it is appropriate to remove face coverings while indoors, and when exactly you should reach for one. Please read the message if you have not done so already. The COVID situation continues to be fluid. We will keep you informed of any new or changing public-health protocols on campus as we approach the Sept. 18 start of fall quarter.</p>
<h2>Additional support for graduate students</h2>
<p>Campus leaders over the past year have worked hard to provide additional support to graduate students, creating new programs focused on housing, student success, and family support, and enhancing existing ones. The support is designed to be responsive to some of the concerns our graduate students have raised about the challenges they face living and learning in our high-cost-of-living area.</p>
<p>The support ranges from up to $1,500 in funding to support incoming Ph.D and MFA graduate students who are transitioning to Santa Cruz to enhancements made to existing Slug Support programs to address graduate-student needs.

<p>The UC Office of the President earlier this week released the final version of its <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/community-safety-plan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG8-P8kpQJyLw8b_j-OJEYsNYDng" href="https://www.ucop.edu/community-safety-plan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 UC Community Safety Plan</a>. The plan, more than a year in the making, was crafted with the goal of transforming UC&#8217;s culture, policies, and practices to create campus communities where all feel welcomed, respected, and protected. It was born out of the national debate on policing that followed the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many other Black Americans and people of color.</p>
<p>President Drake&#8217;s Community Safety Plan for the system does not supplant the ongoing work to create lasting change on our campus. The UCSC Campus Safety Community Advisory Board earlier this summer sent me its recommendations. With President Drake&#8217;s plan now in hand, we plan to develop a clearer understanding of how these efforts can work in concert. I will communicate broadly on this topic this fall.</p>
<h2>Parking fees reduced</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing push to support employees and students, campus parking fees will be subsidized centrally this academic year. Individuals who purchase quarterly, annual, or multi-year A, B, C, or R parking permits will see a 15 percent drop in cost, effective Sept. 1. Other parking fees will remain the same.</p>
<p>More information on the various permits available to campus community members and the reduced fees is <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://taps.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGT29PS1umOx4UEnmSxZP1xIGENPg" href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available on the TAPS website</a>. You&#8217;ll also find details on how those who prepaid for 2021-22 permits can receive refunds and how the reduced fees will impact those who pay for permits through payroll deductions.</p>
<h2>Athletics &amp; Recreation Complex now open</h2>
<p>Our campus Athletics &amp; Recreation Complex &#8212; our pool, tennis, courts and Fitness Center &#8212; is now reopened to all Slug Recreation members. That means our undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, emeriti, staff, alumni, retirees, affiliates, and community members all have access once again. For hours of operation and more details on facility access and COVID mitigation policies, please read <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recreation.ucsc.edu/news/fitnesscenter-reopens-821.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629495522699000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwck_9fjLL4oGLd4Ra-gC_9X6xoA" href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/news/fitnesscenter-reopens-821.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the post by Recreation staff</a>.</p>

In the future, climate change is projected to increase drought risk and intensity across California and in other parts of the American West. Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions now is crucial to limiting the damage. But adapting to the climate change impacts that are already here will also require technological innovation and long-term policy vision to protect water supply. UC Santa Cruz experts share research-based insights that could inform future drought management.</p>
<h2>Influencing residential water-use behaviors</h2>
<p><em>Jeremy West is an assistant professor of economics and lead author of a new <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/&#126;jwest1/articles/West_Fairlie_Pratt_Rose_WaterSmart.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a> comparing the effects of social pressure with automated enforcement technology for irrigation regulations.</em></p>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="Jeremy west in front of trees" height="200" src="images/west-200.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As drought conditions become more frequent, policymakers are increasingly drawing on new technologies, like automated water metering, to implement water conservation policies. Our research studied two technology-driven interventions that were used by a Southern California city to encourage households to use less water during drought. The first sent automated warning letters to households that disobeyed the city's policy of allowing lawn irrigation only on two days per week. The second sent home water reports comparing each household&#8217;s water use with that of their neighbors to build social pressure for water conservation. Both were made possible through &#8220;smart meter&#8221; automated water metering infrastructure and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using hourly data on household water consumption, our study found that both interventions resulted in water conservation, but automated warning notices reduced household water use by 31 percent, compared to roughly 3 percent for home water reports. However, warning notices caused households to shift some of their water consumption into unregulated time periods, while home water reports did not. Our research suggests that these strategies could be complementary, highlighting the merits of multidimensional conservation programs. As the technological capacity for automated enforcement grows, utilities and public policymakers will need to carefully balance the potential unpopularity of these technologies against the large social benefits of successful resource conservation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groundwater resources in California are increasingly stressed by rising demand, shifting land use, and a changing climate. My research group is collaborating with other scientists, students, agencies, foundations, and motivated stakeholders to figure out where more water could be added to recharge over-pumped aquifers, and we&#8217;re developing methods to improve water quality in the process. We helped to create, and now run, </span><a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CLEE_ReNeM_IssueBrief.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California's first "recharge net-metering" program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where landowners can receive a water fee rebate by collecting excess stormwater and allowing it to percolate into the ground, a process called infiltration.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re also running simulations to figure out where there may be excess stormwater runoff, and we&#8217;re mapping promising areas where groundwater recharge could be increased. We&#8217;re helping to design, build, and validate new water collection and infiltration systems. And we&#8217;re running tests in the lab and field, including experiments during managed aquifer recharge operations, to measure water quality improvements and determine how adding amendments to soils can remove contaminants during infiltration. As climate change transforms our hydrologic cycle, new approaches are needed, including novel tools, methods, partnerships, and ways of thinking about groundwater and connected aquatic systems.</span></p>
<h2>Identifying &#8220;win-win&#8221; water conservation opportunities<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elliott Campbell is the Stephen R. Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food System Sustainability and senior author of a paper that explored the potential of </span></i><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/solar-canals.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar canals</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;&#160;</span></i></p>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="Elliott Campbell outdoors" height="200" src="images/campbell-200.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drought puts our water problems front and center. But don't expect the bad news to end there. Tough times for water mean tough times for energy too. When reservoir levels drop, we make less hydropower. When groundwater levels drop, we use more energy to lift water to the surface from deeper wells. But this water-energy connection isn&#8217;t all bad news.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research uncovered a win-win opportunity for California&#8217;s water and energy systems. Using computer simulations, we found that covering California&#8217;s 6,350 km canal network with solar panels could save water and reduce energy costs. Each kilometer of solar aqueduct conserves enough water for around 50 households. While not a silver bullet, these are significant water savings that could contribute to a portfolio of water conservation strategies.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Building drought reserves for the future</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth Langridge is a senior researcher and lecturer in Politics and Legal Studies and the research director for </span></i><a href="https://droughtreserves.ucsc.edu/index.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water Management for Security &amp; Sustainability</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examining groundwater governance and the linkages between groundwater, drought, land use and climate change.</span></i></p>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="Ruth Langridge posing indoors" height="200" src="images/langridge3-200.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every drought over the past decade has intensified impacts to water supplies, and it is vital that policy approaches to water supply security and sustainability be re-imagined for the future. In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which requires specific overdrafted groundwater basins to form local groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) and produce groundwater sustainability plans. SGMA was a beginning and an important effort, but the law only requires management to address groundwater storage loss after SGMA&#8217;s enactment, avoiding the issue of the already significant loss of storage that had occured before 2014. Restoring that original capacity could contribute to the state&#8217;s &#8220;strategic drought reserve.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, drought-related restrictions on water use for residential and commercial users are generally rescinded during wet periods, losing another major opportunity to create reserves for dry periods. Demand management strategies can be used not just to bring a basin into sustainability, but also to maintain water demand below available supply in order to establish drought reserves. Similarly, groundwater management efforts could aim to not only refill basins during wet periods, but to also limit withdrawals during those wet periods to enable the development of a local groundwater drought reserve for use only during drought. These strategies are being more widely developed.</span></p>
<h2>Activating the planning potential of public water agencies</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent Haddad is a professor of environmental studies and director of the </span></i><a href="https://ciwr.ucsc.edu/about-the-center-"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Integrated Water Research</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="Brent Haddad on the UCSC campus in front of a building" height="200" src="images/haddad-200.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short run, what matters is how effective the local water agency and its oversight boards have been in establishing drought emergency plans and how successful they are in announcing and communicating them to the public. The plans themselves should be a combination of actions the region can take and incentives to private water users to reduce consumption. As the drought worsens, the incentives become stronger. In the medium term&#8212;meaning a few years before the next drought is likely to start&#8212;the agency can review and revise its drought plans, including how it will communicate with the public and what it wants the public to do.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">A local water agency can also use medium-term planning to address and receive buy-in on the details of its drought plans, including difficult questions about how much different sectors&#8212;like residential, government, commercial, industrial, and agricultural&#8212;are curtailed as droughts worsen and how to deal with water wasters. Rate structures can be revised to generate strong incentives for conservation and support drought emergency funds. In the longer term, the agency should address infrastructure needs that will create a more resilient water system. These include expanding carry-over water storage capacity, leak detection, real-time flow monitoring, and pursuit of technology to develop groundwater, water reuse, desalination, or other new sources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>

major figure in Chicano literature, Sandra Cisneros is best known for her first novel, </span><span><i>The House on Mango Street</i>,</span><span> a coming of age story, partly based on her own experience, about a 12-year-old girl growing up in the Hispanic quarter of Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span>Published in 1984, the book has sold over 6 million copies and been translated into more than 20 languages. It made the New York Times Best Seller list and won the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>It also became required reading in middle schools, high schools, and universities throughout the United States, and was even adapted into a stage play by playwright, and screenwriter Tanya Saracho, who recently developed the <i>Starz </i>television series, <i>Vida</i>, and once noted in an <a href="https://www.steppenwolf.org/articles/a-conversation-with-the-house-on-mango-street-adaptor-tanya-saracho/"><strong><i>interview</i></strong></a> that the book &#8220;is such a masterpiece, and so iconic in our community, that I was originally scared to adapt it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>A poet, short story writer, novelist, essayist and artist, Cisneros is also the author of<i> Bad Boys, My Wicked Wicked Ways, Loose Woman, Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, Caramelo, Have You Seen Marie?, Vintage Cisneros,</i> <em>Bravo, Bruno</em>, <i>A House of My Own: Stories from My Life</i>, and <i>Puro Amor.</i> Born in Chicago in 1954, she is a citizen of both the United States and Mexico.</span></p>
<p>On September 8, UCSC&#8217;s Hu<span>manities Institute is co-sponsoring a special ticketed online event with Bookshop Santa Cruz, featuring Cisneros in conversation with Emmy Award-winning journalist Rub&#233;n Mart&#237;nez, in celebration of her new book, <i>Martita, I Remember You/Martita, te recuerdo. </i>The book will be published the day before in a dual-language edition.</span></p>
<p><span>Martinez is the author of:&#160;<i>Desert America: A Journey Across Our Most Divided Landscape</i> and <i>Crossing Over: A Mexican Family on the Migrant Trail</i>. His essays, opinions, and reporting have appeared in a variety of publications such as the&#160;<i>New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Nation, Spin, Sojourners</i>,&#160;and&#160;<i>Mother Jones</i>.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cisneros&#8217; new book revolves</strong> around a woman named Corina, who at a young age, leaves her Mexican family in Chicago to follow her dream of becoming a writer in the cafes of Paris. Instead, her brief stay ends up consisting mostly of running out of money, making friends with panhandling artists in the metro, sleeping on crowded floors, and dancing the tango at underground parties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>But the hard times are more than balanced by the intense friendships she developed during her time there with two other women, now long out of touch, which all comes back to her years later with the discovery of a lost forgotten letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Cisneros has received numerous awards, including NEA fellowships in both poetry and fiction, a MacArthur &#8220;Genius&#8221; Fellowship, honorary doctorates, and national and international book awards that include Chicago&#8217;s Fifth Star Award, the PEN America Literary Award, and the National Medal of Arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Over the years, she has also fostered the careers of many aspiring and emerging writers by founding two nonprofit organizations: the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. Cisnero is also the organizer of Los MacArturos&#8212;Latino MacArthur fellows who are community activists.</span></p>
<p><span>She recently received the Ford Foundation&#8217;s Art of Change Fellowship, was named one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/jul/05/the-frederick-douglass-200">Frederick Douglass 200</a>, and won the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

This year&#8217;s projects deal with a range of pressing issues, including food supply, water, and wildfires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our 2021 call for proposals added the unique element of including a specific technology platform, in this case drones, to coincide with a new programmatic focus on aviation and a new initiative here at UCSC, which we&#8217;ll be announcing in the coming weeks,&#8221; said CITRIS UCSC Campus Director J.J. Garcia-Luna-Acevez, distinguished professor of computer science and engineering. &#8220;As in past years, we were thrilled to see the range of creativity and commitment to exploring innovative solutions to our shared challenges displayed by the UCSC research community. We&#8217;re excited to support this year&#8217;s teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CITRIS UCSC Campus Seed Funding program provides funding up to $40,000 for individual projects that prioritize collaboration between principal investigators (PIs) from at least two separate campus divisions and use information technology to solve a significant societal challenge.</p>
<h3>Measuring the fate of snowmelt</h3>
<p>Water melted from the Sierra Nevada snowpack is critical for California&#8217;s economy and ecosystems, making up a critical portion of the state&#8217;s water supply. Despite this importance, we do not know how climate-related changes to the snowpack will be affected by the physical soil structure and feedback on plant root development. Many critical watersheds face increasing water and forest management issues due in large part to recent population growth, increasing water demands, wildfire risk, fluctuating year-to-year snowpack levels, and increased drought severity.</p>
<p>To help address this challenge, PI Michael Loik from Environmental Studies and co-PI Margaret Zimmer from Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences will use drone flights to capture data on evapotranspiration (ET, water loss from leaves and soils). Using that data, they will create spatial &#8220;heat maps&#8221; showing daily and seasonal ET from different shrub species and open soil in relation to prior snow depth. These data can be used for projection of water availability in communities that rely on remote watersheds, for the prediction of and response to wildfires, and for the protection of endangered species.</p>
<h3>Online plant disease detection</h3>
<p>Plant diseases in agriculture cause loss of crop yield, reduced food quality, supply chain disruption, and excessive preemptive use of toxic pesticides. Diseases in wildlands disrupt ecological processes, increase intensity of wildfires, and lead to quarantines with widespread economic impacts. Vast fields and remote, inaccessible forest areas make traditional methods of detection, which require physical inspection, impractical. Capturing aerial data, while faster, can still present long processing delays before actionable results are available, which prohibits real-time and online investigation of sites of interest.</p>
<p>PI Steve McGuire from Electrical and Computer Engineering and co-PI Greg Gilbert from Environmental Studies will use drone-based multispectral sensors combined with a machine learning back end to create a rapid-assessment tool for detecting disease outbreaks, allowing operators to investigate these areas of interest directly and take action.</p>
<h3>Wildfire risk assessment</h3>
<p>Monitoring the conditions in vast, inaccessible forest areas can be next to impossible, but is critical in predicting and mitigating wildfires. PI Katia Obraczka from Computer Science and Engineering and co-PIs Kai Zhu from Environmental Studies and Ricardo Sanfelice from Electrical and Computer Engineering are developing a low-cost network of both ground- and UAV-based sensors to continuously collect fine-grained environmental data to improve the accuracy of wildfire risk assessment models. The system aims to assist in predicting near-future extreme weather events, and to provide a decision support tool to help mitigate the threat wildfires pose to communities.</p>
<p>"We are very grateful to CITRIS UCSC for the support,&#8221; said Professor Obraczka. &#8220;It will allow us to jump-start the development of EUREKA, which will help mitigate wildfire risk by providing environmental information at adequate spatio-temporal timescales and thus improve the accuracy of wildfire risk assessment models."</p>
<p>The Center of Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) is a multi-campus initiative focused on research and emerging technologies. Established in 2001, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute leverages the interdisciplinary research strengths of UC Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Davis, and Merced to advance the University of California's mission. The institute was created to shorten the pipeline between world-class laboratory research and the development of impact applications, platforms, companies, and new industries. Together with many public and private partners, the institute is shaping the future of technology in ways that cross traditional boundaries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="798306eb807270466cc00b00816f3471"><name>pfizer-vaccine-approval</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Full approval for Pfizer vaccine good news in push for vaccinations</title><summary>For the health and well-being of all of our community members, it’s important that everyone who can get vaccinated does so.</summary><start-date>1629788400000</start-date><display-name>Full approval for Pfizer vaccine good news in push for vaccinations</display-name><path>/2021/08/pfizer-vaccine-approval</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/pfizer-vaccine-approval</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1629831235284</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662577312603</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Monday&#8217;s announcement that federal regulators have granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is good news, and it arrives at a crucial time in the collective global push to beat back the pandemic that has turned our world upside down over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>We are hopeful that this regulatory milestone will increase inoculation rates and spark a wave of vaccine mandates like the one adopted by the University of California. The approval comes amid a surge of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant, which has an outsized impact on the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>As educators &#8212; and leaders of a world-renowned research university &#8212; we believe deeply in science. Based on the evidence, we know that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality that comes with full FDA authorization, and believe the public can feel confident that this vaccine is both safe and effective.</p>
<p>The FDA approval comes at an important time in our campus vaccination push. The Office of the President considers a fully vaccinated campus one where at least 90 percent of students, faculty and staff are fully vaccinated. It is imperative we reach that threshold by Sept. 9, which is the deadline for employees and students to submit their proof of vaccination or to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629917373191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzd6g5JkhhALIEenxSzTwYi4YNRA" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initiate a request for exception</a>. Our vaccination numbers are increasing &#8212; as of Monday afternoon, 61 percent of employees had submitted their vaccination details, 60 percent of students &#8212; but these numbers still are not where they need to be.</p>
<p>As a comparison, approximately 94 percent of undergraduates and graduate students who are enrolling at UC Berkeley this fall have submitted their proof of vaccination. More than 87 percent of their faculty and staff have submitted proof. Classes start Aug. 25 at Berkeley, so they have had a head start, but we are now just a month out from our first day of classes. Please do not delay any longer.</p>

<li>Students should log in to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629917373192000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENh2cbxGuXxQx0RLRcm5eOpAO-hw" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus health portal</a>, go to Medical Clearances, then COVID-19 to add their information. If you received your vaccine from our on-campus clinic, we already have a record of your vaccine and no other action is required on your part for verification.</li>
<li>If you are planning to be vaccinated and have yet to schedule shots, now is the time to do it. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1629917373192000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1eqm8HEhP7425WrQ6ehmj6bjX6g" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Many options are available to you.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the health and well-being of all of our community members, it&#8217;s important that everyone who can get vaccinated does so. The FDA approval hopefully gives peace of mind to those who were waiting for full authorization to schedule their shots. We have that now.

<p>KZSC is joined in the campaign by student-run radio stations at UC Davis, UCLA, Loyola Marymount University, and San Jose City College together with National Public Radio and Pacifica Radio network stations from across California. The campaign encourages listeners to support their local non-commercial, educational radio stations with their donations and to &#8220;Listen Local.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This past year has underlined the importance of access to trustworthy public media for everyone in our communities," the participating stations said in a joint statement. " In the midst of unprecedented challenges, public radio stations across the state stand together united for what connects us. Whether it&#8217;s the importance of information, or the power of music, we believe in public radio&#8217;s ability to uplift voices of the community, to entertain, educate, inform, and inspire, and so do our listeners. From timely and localized reporting on fires to shining a light on our communities, public radio is essential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Highlighting KZSC&#8217;s commitment to localism and educational radio, John Malkin&#8217;s Transformation Highway program will interview the Chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, Valentin Lopez, at noon.&#160;</p>
<p>Chairman Lopez will speak about the El Camino Real Bell Removal Ceremony taking place on Saturday, August 28 at Mission Plaza Park in Santa Cruz. The work of the Amah Mutsun Land Trust and efforts to establish Critical Mission Studies programs at the University of California will also be highlighted.&#160; People can listen locally at 88.1 FM and at <a href="http://KZSC.org">KZSC.org</a> at noon on California Public Radio Day.</p>
<p>KZSC is a noncommercial, educational, community radio station and student-run organization at UC Santa Cruz. At our core, we are curators, journalists, and advocates of inclusivity and the collaborative arts. We at KZSC share the goal of uplifting alternative and underrepresented voices in the media.</p>

A longstanding challenge for scientists and regulatory agencies alike has been to understand the biological significance of those changes in terms of their overall impact on affected populations of animals.</p>
<p>A new study led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, provides a comprehensive framework for conducting this type of assessment. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0325">Published August 25 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, the paper synthesizes a huge amount of knowledge about marine mammals and research on the impacts of various disturbances.</p>
<p>Senior author Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said he first began grappling with this problem decades ago when he was studying the impact of low-frequency sound on whales and other marine mammals. &#8220;We had measurable parameters that were statistically significant, but we didn&#8217;t know the biological significance of these changes in behavior. That bothered me, and it bothered a lot of other people in the field,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A 2005 report from the National Research Council led to the development of an approach, known as the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) framework, which can be used to assess the bioenergetic costs of behavioral changes. Since then, researchers have been developing quantitative models of PCoD for different species and types of disturbances.</p>
<p>&#8220;These models provide a lot of information, but we wanted to take a holistic approach by identifying the common themes and using those concepts to inform how wildlife managers and others can go about assessing the risks of a proposed activity,&#8221; said first author Kelly Keen, a UCSC graduate student who previously worked for the California State Lands Commission as an environmental scientist. &#8220;Coming from state government and having done a lot of risk assessments, I was interested in how these quantitative models can be applied.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new study highlights the importance of life history traits such as reproductive strategies, movement patterns, body size, and pace of life in determining the vulnerability of a species to different types of disturbances. For example, Costa explained how differences in breeding behavior can make California sea lions less resilient than northern elephant seals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The California sea lion lives paycheck to paycheck,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The mom has her pup on the beach, and then she goes out to sea to feed, comes back and suckles her pup, then goes back out and feeds again. She&#8217;s restricted to a relatively small area and can&#8217;t go far from the colony, so if there&#8217;s a disturbance that affects her feeding, that has a big impact because she doesn&#8217;t have money in the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elephant seal moms, on the other hand, have money in the bank. They migrate great distances across the North Pacific Ocean, feeding and storing energy, so when they come back to the colony to give birth they can stay on the beach with their pup. &#8220;They don&#8217;t feed while they&#8217;re nursing, they just dump all that stored energy into the pup,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;They&#8217;re more resilient because they cover such a large area while they&#8217;re feeding and can more easily avoid any given stressor.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, if there are both elephant seals and sea lions in an area where a proposed activity could disturb them, the sea lion population is likely to be at greater risk. Similarly, different considerations apply to species with a &#8220;live fast, die young&#8221; pace of life and a high reproductive rate, such as harbor porpoises, versus a large whale species that is slow to mature and reproduce.</p>
<p>&#8220;What regulators really want is a tool where you can plug in the numbers and the species and it spits out an answer,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not there yet, but this is the next best thing. It tells you the key characteristics you need to consider in making a decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to life history features, the paper outlines the importance of the specific characteristics of the disturbance, including its location, duration, and frequency. Environmental conditions, including climate change, can also influence a population&#8217;s sensitivity to disturbances, Keen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These models are steeped in the bioenergetics framework, so we looked at prey availability and how that could be affected by environmental conditions in a specific area, because if there is an overlapping disturbance in that area, that could have consequences for the population,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Costa noted that California&#8217;s coastal waters, with the most diverse marine mammal fauna in the world, is a particularly challenging place to do this type of risk assessment. Although he doesn&#8217;t expect to see new offshore oil development, the move toward renewable energy resources means a growing number of proposals to develop offshore wind and wave power in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;In deciding where to put something like that, a complete quantitative assessment is always going to be difficult,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;With this conceptual process, we can at least make informed judgments. It&#8217;s a tool that can tell you what considerations you need to be thinking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the recent weeks, we have heard feedback from faculty, instructors, graduate students, staff, and deans, all passing along concerns about the risks of classroom teaching. We want to address this apprehension and provide some guidance.</p>
<p>The optimism felt by many in spring and early summer, brought on by the availability of COVID vaccines, has been replaced by unease as we face a surge in coronavirus cases caused by the highly contagious Delta variant. We acknowledge that this dynamic environment is frustrating and exhausting.</p>
<p>We understand the concerns of so many of you, particularly those with unvaccinated young children at home or immunocompromised family members, and recognize that we must adjust to the current situation. As we all individually and collectively adjust to life with the coronavirus and the risk it poses in our daily lives, we are committed to decision-making that is informed by science, focused on our mission, transparent, and honest.</p>
<p>Some may ask, given this environment, why should we return to a largely in-person community. The answer is to support the well-being of our students, while also taking extensive measures to mitigate the risks to our campus community, including faculty and staff.</p>
<p>A distanced learning environment worked well enough for some students, but the majority shared that the experience was isolating, frustrating, and depressing. Across the country, the mental health impacts have been documented. We want to be sure our students are able to successfully pursue their education in an environment where they can connect and share common experiences through a campus presence.</p>
<h2>Vaccines are critical</h2>
<p>We are taking a multi-prong approach to support the health and well-being of our campus community. That includes creating a campus community with a high rate of vaccination; requiring face coverings for indoor situations; and continuing our highly successful testing program to rapidly identify cases.</p>
<p>In addition to working with our own faculty, who have helped to guide our planning, we have remained in close contact with University of California health leaders, who are among the most respected in the world.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be our best defense against the virus including the Delta variant. We have all seen that breakthrough cases do happen. However,<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630170649373000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1ltzWRK79qW5VLPxXAie02eWzkA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a><span>&#160;</span>currently shows that the prevalence of a fully vaccinated person experiencing a breakthrough infection resulting in hospitalization or death is 0.0058 percent.</p>
<p>The Delta variant is the predominant coronavirus strain in our local community, and the majority of the cases arise from those who are not vaccinated. We cannot completely contain this virus. It is highly transmissible, with a short incubation period. As we have seen in college campuses nationwide, there will be infections on campus, and we must accept that. Our priority is to avoid significant spread with the goal of minimizing severe infections.</p>
<p>With the UC vaccine policy in place, our goal is to have at least 90 percent of our campus community vaccinated prior to the start of instruction. This will significantly reduce the virus&#8217;s prevalence on campus. This vaccination rate will be significantly higher than the rate in our surrounding community and the rest of California.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also requiring masks in classrooms and most other indoor situations, regardless of vaccination status. A high-quality face mask has proven to be another effective tool in reducing the virus&#8217;s spread. None of our health center staff, even those treating students with COVID, have contracted the virus in connection with patient care. N95 masks are<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZWheLtmc7GOAeEz4qh8Dl_mT9v6FaJlYNOSzQdCEJAJe1WQ/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630170649373000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQwje-EViTA2PvlTfxSVhtSMwIpQ" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZWheLtmc7GOAeEz4qh8Dl_mT9v6FaJlYNOSzQdCEJAJe1WQ/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available to all employees</a><span>&#160;</span>and offer even greater protection. Those requesting an N95 must complete the short<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uc.sumtotal.host/Core/pillarRedirect?relyingParty%3DLM%26url%3Dcore%252Factivitydetails%252FViewActivityDetails%253FActivityId%253D360150%2526UserMode%253D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630170649373000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6ORqMSazveI0FuAYFYDmRud807w" href="https://uc.sumtotal.host/Core/pillarRedirect?relyingParty=LM&amp;url=core%2Factivitydetails%2FViewActivityDetails%3FActivityId%3D360150%26UserMode%3D0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">N95 Voluntary Use training</a>. For those who want an added layer of protection, we advise wearing a cloth mask over a N95/KN95.</p>
<p>Finally, the campus will continue to run its highly successful asymptomatic COVID-19 testing program. This regular testing will help identify cases and allow us to isolate and quarantine people as appropriate.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Public health authorities tell us that the risk of being together for the sake of our students is manageable. They tell us that classrooms where everyone is masked are not places where transmission is likely to occur. If changes in the external environment or on campus dictate a change, we will react quickly. In the meantime, we can give our students the in-person experience they want and expect because we rose to the challenge of vaccinating our community and are complying with all of the mandates that our public health officials have advised.</p>
<p>Additional information for instructors, graduate students, and instructional staff will be provided in the next few days. Our asymptomatic testing approach will be communicated as well. There will never be zero risk from this or any other infectious disease; however, with the non-pharmaceutical interventions outlined above and our high vaccination rates, we know that we can move forward with these plans for in-person learning.</p>
<p>This pandemic has taught us all to be flexible and responsive to the changing conditions. As we start fall quarter, we will closely monitor what&#8217;s happening on campus and in our local community and take the appropriate steps to best ensure the health and well-being of our campus community.</p>

<p>With the fall quarter less than a month away, we have heard many questions and concerns about delivering in-person instruction in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the presence of the Delta variant. This message and a forthcoming webpage with frequently asked questions are intended to respond to many of the policy-related questions that have been raised to date.</p>
<p>Some have asked whether they can shift a class from in-person to remote instruction. Changes to the modality generally will not be allowed, except in certain situations (see FAQ 6 below). UC Santa Cruz is no longer subject to public health restrictions that required us to shift to remote instruction, and public health leaders have advised that classrooms, with appropriate mitigations such as face coverings, are not places where transmission is likely to occur.</p>
<p>We will be hosting a question and answer session for faculty and department staff at noon on Tuesday, August 31, to answer further questions in-person instructors may have after reading this guidance. You can<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcqcu6tqDwuHtGjw5xCoUGHU8VkBOiFXdLN&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630191229407000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxzVgUZhxqeuK4eEtRk1Fo-UCwQQ" href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcqcu6tqDwuHtGjw5xCoUGHU8VkBOiFXdLN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">register for this event online</a>.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s guidance concerns matters of immediate relevance to health and safety and to campus policy, we understand that instructors will have further pragmatic questions about how to navigate the return to in-person instruction. The instructional support team at CITL/Online Ed/FITC is developing answers to many of the frequently asked questions submitted by instructors, and this FAQ will be circulated early next week and will be posted online on the<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630191229407000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1V0jOgKo8PdlDkrwtAilXt4KXjg" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keep Teaching website</a>. The instructional continuity group will continue to update and expand the FAQ as we get closer to the start of instruction.</p>
<p>We recognize that this academic year will present new challenges as we again navigate the change that comes from transitioning back to in-person teaching and learning after more than a year in remote instruction.</p>

We will continue to prioritize the community&#8217;s health and well-being and respond appropriately to changes in guidance from public health officials.</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate your patience, your commitment to our mission, and your partnership as we work together to provide a world-class education to our students.</p>

<h3 id="1.ifastudentinmyinpersonclasstestspositiveandisinstructedtoself-isolatebythestudenthealthcenterwilltherestoftheclassandineedtoquarantineshouldwebetestedshouldweallisolateuntiltestresultscomeback">1. If a student in my in person class tests positive and is instructed to self-isolate by the student health center, will the rest of the class and I need to quarantine? Should we be tested? Should we all isolate until test results come back?</h3>
<p>Students and Instructors in a class where someone has tested positive will be notified, likely by email. Per the campus guidance, students and instructors who were masked and vaccinated do not need to quarantine as long as they are not showing any symptoms.<br/> People who are <strong>not</strong> vaccinated and attended class with someone who tested positive for COVID&#8211;19 must quarantine for 10 days.<br/> Testing is recommended 3&#8211;5 days after exposure for those in a class where someone tests positive. Asymptomatic testing is available on campus. Symptomatic students should go to the Student Health Center to be tested. Symptomatic instructors/faculty should contact their health provider to find out where symptomatic testing is being offered.<br/> Following CDC guidance, people who are fully vaccinated with no COVID-like symptoms do not need to quarantine or be restricted from work following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID&#8211;19. Any fully vaccinated person who experiences symptoms consistent with COVID&#8211;19 should isolate themselves from others for 10 days, be clinically evaluated for COVID&#8211;19, and tested for COVID&#8211;19 if recommended.<br/> If you know the identity of the student because the student has contacted you directly, you should not communicate the student&#8217;s identity to the class or to anyone else. If you receive information about a positive student in class from those in charge of positive COVID test notifications, please note that you will not be given the identity of the student.</p>
<h3 id="2.howwillibenotifiedifastudentinmyin-personclasstestspositive">2. How will I be notified if a student in my in-person class tests positive?</h3>
<p>When someone tests positive, the case investigation process begins. Anyone identified to be notified through this process will receive notice, including instructors of in-person classes, studios, and labs.</p>
<h3 id="3.whathappensifastudentmustself-isolateorquarantineandcannotattendanin-personclass">3. What happens if a student must self-isolate or quarantine and cannot attend an in-person class?</h3>
<p>Instructors can <strong>temporarily accommodate students</strong> who are quarantining or self isolating by allowing them to attend class remotely for a few days, should the class material and the student&#8217;s health allow that ( <a href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/post-remote-teaching">infographic on Temporary Blended Synchronous</a> ). If it is not possible to meet the learning goals through remote attendance of an in-person course, the instructor should consider other options to make it possible for the student to keep learning, including alternative assignments, office hours, or other measures as needed and as available. CITL and Online Education are available to consult at any time with instructors who need help with blended synchronous instruction or who are seeking advice about other ways students can keep learning. Further guidance on the topic of what to do when a student must isolate or quarantine from an in person class will be provided in the coming days from CITL/OE/FITC. This instructional FAQ will be consistently updated before and into the Fall quarter.</p>
<h3 id="4.whathappensifoneofthecourseteachingassistantsmustself-isolateorquarantineandcannotattendanin-personclass">4. What happens if one of the course Teaching Assistants must self-isolate or quarantine and cannot attend an in-person class?</h3>
<p>The Teaching Assistant, if their health allows, can attend class remotely using the same <a href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/post-remote-teaching">blended synchronous</a> measures you would use to accommodate a student in the same situation. If the Teaching Assistant is scheduled to teach an in-person discussion section, that section should be held remotely until the Teaching Assistant is cleared by their medical provider. If the Teaching Assistant is scheduled to teach a lab section that must be held in-person, the instructor should work with the other Teaching Assistants to cover the lab, while remaining attentive to workload limits specified by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<h3 id="5.whatshouldidoifiastheinstructortestpositivewhileteachinganin-personclassorifineedtoquarantinebecauseihavehadclosecontactwithsomeoneforinstanceinmyhouseholdwhohastestedpositiveforcovid19">5. What should I do if I, as the instructor, test positive while teaching an in-person class, or if I need to quarantine because I have had close contact with someone (for instance, in my household) who has tested positive for COVID 19?</h3>
<p>Self-isolate or quarantine following current CDC and campus guidelines and guidance from your medical provider. <a href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-reporting/">Notify your Department Chair or other Supervisor</a> , per campus guidance. This is particularly important in the event of a positive COVID test taken off-campus, so that the campus contact tracing mechanism can be mobilized. If you feel well enough, transition the class to remote instruction. If not, work with your chair to identify an alternate instructor for the time that you are unable to teach. Notify the class promptly that you need to shift the class to remote format for quarantine/isolation (you do not need to specify which). If students ask whether they need to get tested, remind them that contact tracers will contact them if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive. In the event of a positive COVID test, do not return to class until you have met the current guidelines for ending a period of isolation. Resume the daily COVID&#8211;19 symptom check when you return to on-campus teaching and work.</p>
<h3 id="6.howcaniastheinstructorrequestanaccommodationtotransitionmyin-personclasstoaremoteformatduetoanexistingdisabilityormedicalcondition">6. How can I, as the instructor, request an accommodation to transition my in-person class to a remote format due to an existing disability or medical condition?</h3>
<p>If you have a disability or become disabled, <a href="https://ada.ucsc.edu/employment-access/academic-employee-accommodations.html">you have the right to a reasonable accommodation</a> needed to do your job. If you need an accommodation, contact your Department Chair, as well as the Academic Personnel Office (dggray@ucsc.edu) and the Disability Management Coordinator (roberts@ucsc.edu or 831&#8211;459&#8211;4602).</p>
<h3 id="7.whatarecampustestingplans">7. What are campus testing plans?</h3>
<p>We are developing plans for testing of both vaccinated and unvaccinated students and employees and we anticipate communicating about these plans soon.</p>
<h3 id="8.ifiastheinstructorexperiencecoldorflu-likesymptomsregardlessofmyvaccinationstatusshouldicontinuetoteachinperson">8. If I, as the instructor, experience cold or flu-like symptoms (regardless of my vaccination status), should I continue to teach in person?</h3>
<p>No. You should complete the daily symptom check and transition the course to remote if you are well enough to teach. Consult your health provider to find out about how best to access symptomatic testing. Do not return to class until you are cleared by your medical provider.</p>
<h3 id="9.areclothfacecoveringsn95orkn95masksavailabletoinstructors">9. Are cloth face coverings, N95 or KN95 masks available to instructors?</h3>
<p>Yes. Masks and other supplies are available. Your department or program manager may have already requested them, so please check in with them first. Otherwise, requests can be made via: <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html">https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html</a></p>
<h3 id="10.willthemaximumclasssizeforin-personinstructionchange">10. Will the maximum class size for in-person instruction change?</h3>
<p>Given our current environment and information, there are no plans to change the current guidance on class size for in-person instruction (classes of more than 150 students meet remotely).</p>
<h3 id="11.willthedensityofclassroomoccupancychange">11. Will the density of classroom occupancy change?</h3>
<p>Not unless state and county guidelines change.</p>
<h3 id="12.canyoushareplansorinformationsurroundingventilationandfiltration">12. Can you share plans or information surrounding ventilation and filtration?</h3>
<p>Our larger buildings have air handling units that bring in filtered air to the indoor spaces, while our smaller buildings often have windows that open. For buildings with operable windows, they can be left open, along with doors, for maximum air flow. Portable air purifiers may be used to move and filter air for smaller classrooms without operable windows through the <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html">campus COVID supplies program</a> . Requests should be submitted by Department or building managers, rather than individual instructors.</p>
<h3 id="13.willanyphysicaldistancinginclassroomslabsorstudiosberequired">13. Will any physical distancing in classrooms, labs, or studios be required?</h3>
<p>Following CDC and CDPH guidance, there are no physical distancing requirements at this time.</p>
<h3 id="14.willstudentsbeallowedtoeatanddrinkinclass">14. Will students be allowed to eat and drink in class?</h3>
<p>Students will not be allowed to eat or drink in class.</p>
<h3 id="15.whowillcommunicatewithstudentsaboutexpectationsforinclassbehaviorsuchasmaskingandnoeatingordrinking">15. Who will communicate with students about expectations for in class behavior such as masking and no eating or drinking?</h3>
<p>Campus-wide instructions regarding masking expectations will be widely disseminated and instructors should refer to them when discussing this topic. Instructors should further advise on in-classroom behavior in the same manner they would advise students about other classroom expectations; e.g., ground rules, attendance, disruption, etc. Including it on the syllabus, initial and ongoing notifications to students. The important thing is to provide students up-front notice of expectations in the classroom, so that we have a basis for taking subsequent action for noncompliance, if needed. Faculty may contact conduct@ucsc.edu for guidance related to classroom conduct and reporting.</p>
<h3 id="16.whatdoidoifstudentstellmetheydon&#8217;tfeelcomfortableattendingclassinperson">16. What do I do if students tell me they don&#8217;t feel comfortable attending class in person?</h3>
<p>Refer students to the appropriate campus resources depending on what you know about why they are not comfortable attending class. Below is a list of possible resources.<br/> * <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> : For mental health concerns related to attending class in person<br/> * <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/">Student Health Center</a> : For health concerns related to attending class in person<br/> * <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a> : For disability related concerns related to attending class in person<br/> * Student Conduct: Believes other students are out of compliance with health and safety protocol and are putting them at risk</p>
<h3 id="17.willinstructorsberequiredtocheckstudentbadgesthedigitalappthattriangulatesstudents&#8217;vaccinationstatustestingrequirementsanddailysymptomcheckintoacolorcodedsystemthatclearsstudentsforphysicalpresenceoncampus">17. Will instructors be required to check <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html">student badges</a> (the digital app that triangulates students&#8217; vaccination status, testing requirements, and daily symptom check into a color coded system that clears students for physical presence on campus)?</h3>
<p>No, instructors will not be required to check badges. To learn about the student badge system, please consult the detailed information on <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html">this page</a> . Scroll down to Step 3 to see examples of the badges that will appear on students&#8217; phones.</p>
<h3 id="18.williastheinstructorbeallowedtocheckstudentbadges">18. Will I, as the instructor, be allowed to check student badges?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can check badges but please do so consistently to avoid allegations of bias, implicit bias, or profiling. For example, it is not recommended that you decide to check the badges of &#8220;random&#8221; students but rather, decide to check badges of all students or every other, every third, every fifth student, etc&#8230; . Please also keep in mind that badges indicate if a student is cleared to be on campus. If a student&#8217;s badge is not green, they should not be admitted to an in-person class. If the badge is yellow, they may simply need to fill out their daily symptom check, and you can encourage them to do so before entering the classroom. A yellow badge may also indicate that the student is overdue for COVID 19 testing.<br/> If a student refuses to show their badge, please handle this incident as you would any in-classroom behavioral issue, and in the same manner you would advise students about other classroom expectations ( e.g., ground rules, attendance, disruption). If they still do not comply, you will need to choose whether you move forward with the class session or cancel it because of concerns for health and safety. Following the incident you are advised to reach out to Student Conduct for consultation on how to mitigate against future incidents of this nature and/or submit an incident report. Student Conduct can provide support on a myriad of interventions with the student ranging from informal resolution and restorative processes to adjudication related to disruptive or harmful behavior. To contact Student Conduct, email conduct@ucsc.edu.</p>
<h3 id="19.caniaskmystudentsiftheyarevaccinated">19. Can I ask my students if they are vaccinated?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<h3 id="20.ifastudenttellsmetheycannotattendanin-personclassorexambecausetheyhavetestedpositiveorareinquarantinehowcaniverifythat">20. If a student tells me they cannot attend an in-person class or exam because they have tested positive or are in quarantine how can I verify that?</h3>
<p>You should be contacted if a student in your class needs to isolate/quarantine. If you have not received such notification, student badges will reflect their isolation/quarantine status. They could send a photo of their badge to the instructor. The badges are dated, so the student won&#8217;t be able to use a photo of an old badge. If a student discloses that they have tested positive or believe themselves to be positive but have reason to believe the university is unaware of this, they should contact the Student Health Center immediately.</p>
<h3 id="21.whatshouldisaytomytasabouttheirresponsibilitiestoteachin-person">21. What should I say to my TAs about their responsibilities to teach in-person?</h3>
<p>TAs should have received advance notification through their appointment process whether they are required to be in-person to fulfill their responsibilities</p>

<p>Students who need to take an exam remotely as a result of disability, illness or medical condition should go to the DRC to request an accommodation. Instructors are not required to provide a student, absent an approved accommodation, their preferred method for an exam.</p>
<h3 id="23.isitpossiblethatsomestudentswillreceivedrcaccommodationstoattendaninpersonclassremotely">23. Is it possible that some students will receive DRC accommodations to attend an in person class remotely?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the dangerous Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, UC Santa Cruz launched an </span><a href="https://ucsc.scalefunder.com/cfund/project/27323"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afghanistan Visiting Scholars Emergency Support Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Aug. 27 that has already raised $100,000 in donations. Those funds&#8212;and a matching contribution from the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor&#8217;s Office&#8212;will support placing at least two at-risk Afghans into visiting scholar appointments at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These placements could help recipients and their families to meet visa requirements for safe entry into the United States. The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees is also offering a new matching contribution of up to $10,000 for additional donations received by midnight, Sept. 3.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to ongoing safety concerns, the university is not disclosing the identities of the people who may become visiting scholars, but they are predominantly at-risk academics, journalists, and activists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people we&#8217;re in communication with have long been thought leaders and beacons of hope in their communities, and now they face urgent danger,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;We are working as hard as we can to offer support and assistance with the resources and channels available to us as a university.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current fundraising drive would bring in at least one visiting scholar to be placed with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for South Asian Studies and at least one more to be sponsored by the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair in Feminist Studies in partnership with the Human Rights Investigations Lab at the Research Center for the Americas. The university is also actively coordinating on other potential placements that will depend upon whether recipients can safely evacuate from Afghanistan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Campus Provost Adrian Brasoveanu has been leading logistical efforts for the campus response. He said the level of support and commitment from UCSC administrators, faculty, staff, students, and the broader community has been phenomenal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This effort came about very quickly, and everyone has been so willing to donate their time and resources,&#8221; Brasoveanu said. &#8220;People really want to help, and we&#8217;ve been working collaboratively as a campus to provide the basic structure to make it all come together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz aims to provide a supportive community for visiting scholars, where they would be safe and could continue their work. Visiting scholars would bring with them a wealth of experience and knowledge in human rights, women's rights, and contemporary politics in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halima Kazem-Stojanovic&#8212;an Afghan-American UCSC Feminist Studies doctoral candidate whose research is about women in Afghanistan&#8212;worked with a team at San Jos&#233; State University&#8217;s Human Rights Institute and UC Berkeley&#8217;s Human Rights Center to establish an initiative called Afghanistan Scholars at Risk, which has made connections between Afghan scholars, journalists, activitists and universities across the country, including UC Santa Cruz. She said placements like these are not only lifesaving in the present but also crucial for Afghanistan&#8217;s future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can create environments for academics and journalists and activists to come to the U.S. with dignity and be able to continue to pursue the work that they were doing in a way that documents the history of Afghanistan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;UCSC would be a great place for them to arrive, take time to process what has happened, and then continue to be incredible advocates for those who have been left behind.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77dbfdd2807270172c1b96bdbd417efd"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>August</title><start-date>1627801200000</start-date><display-name>August</display-name><path>/2021/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2021/08/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1608328674756</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609787687846</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
