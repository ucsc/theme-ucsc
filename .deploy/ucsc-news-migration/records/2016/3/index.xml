<p>&#8220;They (students) never think to draw a person of color or a woman,&#8221; says Riggs, who got his Ph.D. in molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2005. &#8220;I want to change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, the 41-year-old Riggs is using his own story of prejudiced encounters, personal stumbles, and the eventual discovery of his own tenaciousness in order to help increase diversity in the sciences. Of the eight science students he has helped get into Ph.D. programs while working at San Francisco State University, Riggs says, six have been students of color.</p>
<p>Riggs grew up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, raised by a father and stepmother who believed strongly in education. Smart and athletic, Riggs missed getting into his school district&#8217;s gifted track because he hadn&#8217;t taken the qualifying test in fourth grade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kind of put a chip on my shoulder,&#8221; said Riggs, who watched enviously as his classmates got coveted spots in AP classes. He got good grades, was on the football team, played the trumpet in the orchestra, and was class vice-president.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had this, &#8216;I&#8217;ll show them,&#8217; mentality,&#8221; Riggs said.</p>
<p>Planning to go into the Navy, he got an acceptance packet from UC Santa Cruz the day before he enlisted and decided to switch paths. But it was not an easy time on the campus.</p>
<p>Speaking by phone from his university office, he tells of feeling like an outsider when he first got to UC Santa Cruz and of once being told by a supervisor that he&#8217;d been accepted for a research position only because he was African American.</p>
<p>A sense of isolation and a lack of maturity caused Riggs to draw inward, which made it seem as if he wasn&#8217;t committed to a science degree, he says. Then three things happened that changed the course of his life. Riggs was selected as a MARC (Maximizing Access to Research Careers) scholar, which aims to help underrepresented students succeed in science. He discovered a mentor in Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology William Sullivan. And, finally, he found himself working as a telemarketer when, despite a strong finish with his undergraduate degree, he couldn&#8217;t quite crack the biotechnology job market.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt once I did telemarketing, I was at a low point in my life,&#8221; said Riggs, who had tried unsuccessfully to get into graduate school and, instead, had spent two years working for the Americorps program in disadvantaged schools before the phone sales job.</p>
<p>That stint as a telemarketer spurred Riggs to return to Sullivan&#8217;s lab where, he says, he decided, &#8220;I may not be the smartest in the room or the one with the best pedigree or the one who graduated summa cum laude but I&#8217;m going to outwork all of you. I&#8217;m not going to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when, he says, &#8220;I got tenacious.&#8221;</p>
<p>His research experience was not without its rough spots but he earned a Ph.D. in molecular, cell and development biology, did post-doc work at UC Berkeley, and then landed the job at San Francisco State, where he runs a lab that is working to better understand the process of cell division and selection of cell fate. But it is his efforts to bring students of color into science that most interests him.</p>
<p>In science, he says, &#8220;We are trying to answer some of the most complicated questions out there. In order to do that, we need people from different backgrounds, with different experiences and different frames of thought. If we have diversity, we are better at answering questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students he mentored are now in Ph.D. programs at Harvard, UC San Francisco, Stanford University, University of Texas Southwestern, and the University of Kobe. All are students of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Blake relates so well with the students he mentors because he has been where they are and he knows what they need to do to accomplish their goals,&#8221; says Professor Frank Bayliss, director of the Student Enrichment Opportunities Office at SFSU. &#8220;He is demanding of his students at an appropriate and successful level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, Riggs was awarded a prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER grant for excellence in teaching and research.</p>
<p>Riggs&#8217;s advice to students comes from his own life, he says. &#8220;I tell them to believe in themselves and be tenacious. Don&#8217;t give up.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/riggs-blake295x128.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/riggs-blake295x128.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>riggs-blake295x128.jpg</name><display-name>riggs-blake295x128.jpg</display-name><file-size>16678</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>BLAKE RIGGS</title><description>Alumnus Blake Riggs uses his own story of prejudiced encounters, personal stumbles, and tenacity to encourage students of color.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="33c2ce7f80727017266c9f8158ef638f"><name>drug-alcohol-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dialogue on drug and alcohol safety</title><summary>The primary mission of the UC Santa Cruz Police Department is to protect the health and safety of the campus community, and our students in particular, from serious harm or death.</summary><start-date>1456819200000</start-date><display-name>Dialogue on drug and alcohol safety</display-name><path>/2016/03/drug-alcohol-safety</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/drug-alcohol-safety</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1456862318162</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457027256642</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The primary mission of the UC Santa Cruz Police Department is to protect the health and safety of the campus community, and our students in particular, from serious harm or death.</p>
<p>A very serious issue affecting the health and safety of our campus community is high-risk drug and/or alcohol use that can result in death. In a <a href="http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/47000-americans-died-drug-overdoses-2014-setting-record/" target="_blank">recent article</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated a new record in 2014 when "more than 47,000 Americans died from drug overdoses ... ," a 6.5 percent increase from 2013.</p>
<p>Last month, the Santa Cruz Coroner released 2015 statistics indicating that there were 58 drug-related deaths in Santa Cruz County. The overwhelming majority of the drug related deaths in Santa Cruz County, 69 percent, were males; the ages of the deceased ranged from 19 to 85 years old; 79 percent of these deaths were classified as accidental overdoses.</p>
<p>In 2015, our campus community experienced overdose deaths, which have had a tremendous impact by leaving behind heartbroken families and friends. We must all reflect on this unnecessary loss of life.vWith our partners at the Cowell Student Health Center, and Colleges, Housing and Educational Services (CHES), we are compelled to provide this information relating to excessive alcohol and other drug use.</p>
<h2>The Facts</h2>
The student overdoses occurred by mixing drugs and alcohol, including heroin, marijuana edibles and/or other substances. The deaths were the result of both the quantity of drugs and/or alcohol consumed. 
<p>A key factor in most overdose deaths is a <strong>delay</strong> in getting medical attention. Many students fear consequences for themselves and their friends and often do not call for medical aid in time. If a student calls for help for someone that appears to be sick or in distress from drug or alcohol use, student conduct officers strongly take such "Good Samaritan" efforts into account in adjudicating any violations of the Code of Conduct so as to not chill students from calling for help.</p>
<p>Additionally, many students believe their friends will be okay if they just "sleep it off." In reality, it is during this critical time that students often overdose in their own beds.</p>
<h2>Reach out for help</h2>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and our partners want to support students in taking care of each other; want students to be educated and empowered to get help; want to address barriers to overdose prevention; and want students to know how and where to get on- and off-campus assistance if you or someone you care about needs help.</p>
<p><strong>Call 911 without hesitation if you suspect someone experiencing alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose.</strong></p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<div>For students, a range of support services is available through the Cowell Student Health Center, including personal counseling through <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>, and Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion (SHOP). SHOP is a safe and anonymous resource for <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/index.html" target="_blank">information related to alcohol and other drug use</a>&#8212;including overdose prevention. 
<p>SHOP's SLUG Party Plan is available <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/party-like-a-slug.html" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved with educating our campus community to prevent overdoses please email <a href="mailto:shop@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">shop@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>As a campus community it is important for us to dialogue about alcohol and other drug safety issues and how we can all play a part in preventing overdose and the other negative effects of drinking and drug use.</p>
<p>In addition to tragic overdose deaths, our students are transported regularly to the hospital for drug and alcohol poisoning. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department cannot address this issue alone. We hope that you will become a partner and share in the responsibility of keeping our community safe.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, we will send out community notices addressing the wide scope of alcohol and other drug issues impacting our community. Please take the time to read these notices, as they will contain important information about keeping yourself and others safe.</p>
<p>These future notices will address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of drugs are found in our community&#160;</li>
<li>The signs and symptoms of an overdose&#160;</li>
<li>What to do in the event of an overdose&#160;</li>
<li>Sharing and the use of prescription drugs&#160;</li>
<li>Marijuana edibles&#160;</li>
<li>Introduce SHOP's new prevention campaign 'Party Like a Slug. What's your Party Plan?'</li>

<br/>
 Over 50 color photographs are accompanied by essays that, as Clifford puts it, &#8220;search for an ecological language and an aesthetic that can do justice to the site&#8217;s complexity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The photographs are all taken between 2001 and 2015, while the text tracks UCSC&#8217;s experiment with environmental design from it&#8217;s very inception, follows it through changing times, and contemplates its continued significance.<br/>
<br/>
 Clifford described how the project came about.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I wanted an outlet for my growing archive of photographs. And I thought we needed more strong images of the place,&#8221; he explained&#160; &#8220;After Ansel Adams&#8217;s black and white photos from the &#8216;60s, there isn&#8217;t much that&#8217;s easily available&#8212;just some postcards (all taken when the sun is shining)."<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The color images show familiar and unusual perspectives--the campus in different lights, in fog, the underside of bridges, trees that seem to invade the buildings, shots up close and distant out across the great bay. And the book design is by Richard Wohlfeiler, a terrific artist, for years a mainstay in the UCSC Art Department.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I see it as an addition to The excellent <em>Natural History</em> and the wonderfully weird <em>Unnatural History</em> of the Santa Cruz campus,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
 Clifford will discuss the interaction of architecture and ecology at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, March 8, when he delivers the <em>2016 Spring Emeriti Faculty Lecture</em> on campus at the Music Center Recital Hall, beginning at&#160; 7:30 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk about the way I&#8217;ve come to know the campus,&#8221; said Clifford.&#160; &#8220;When I arrived in 1978, like so many others, I was amazed by the place. Its beauty was just overwhelming. And then I settled into my work and stopped really noticing. Then, around 2000 I started taking digital photographs, and this opened up the place. I began to notice all the different views, the alternating light-environments, the seasonal changes. In the lecture I&#8217;ll describe some of what I discovered, and show a lot of images.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;ll also say something about the early planning choices that made the campus what it is,&#8221; he added. &#8220;For example the crucial decision not to build in the meadow but instead in the transition zone from forest to grassland, what ecologists call the ecotone. How did a large university get built among the redwoods and rugged ravines and knolls, without ruining the place? It wasn&#8217;t inevitable.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Clifford came to UCSC in 1978 to join the History of Consciousness Department. He earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in history, but benefiting from the interdisciplinary environment at UC Santa Cruz, he has worked extensively in cultural anthropology and literary/cultural studies.<br/>
<br/>
 He was the founding director of the UCSC Center for Cultural Studies and is a Guggenheim Fellow and Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His books include <em>The Predicament of Culture, Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late 20th Century</em>, and most recently, <em>Returns: Becoming Indigenous in the 21st Century</em>. He retired in 2010.<br/>
<br/>
 Clifford noted that no other university has been built on so complex and rugged a site as UC Santa Cruz. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Thomas Church, the great landscape designer who was instrumental in planning the campus, advised the early architects: 'Don&#8217;t compete with the redwoods. They&#8217;re going to win,'&#8221; said Clifford. &#8220;The builders listened to him, and so here the physical environment isn&#8217;t just a setting for the architecture. It IS the architecture! That&#8217;s something special.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The solutions for some quite difficult problems of siting and scale at UCSC are exemplary,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I think the place is still a brilliant work of environmental art.&#8221;</p>

Marlowe (Photo by&#160;Muhi Khwaja/Focus Photography)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>New diversity officer Sheree Marlowe worked five years as a trial attorney before she came to UC Santa Cruz</article-subhead><article-text><p>Sheree M. Marlowe was just 8 when she announced to her family that she wanted to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>Raised by a single mom in Southern California, she came from an extended family where no one had ever been to college. She didn't know how she was going to get to college, let alone law school, but when she was a little older, she met someone who was black&#8212;and a lawyer&#8212;and she soon understood the transformational power of role models.</p>
<p>She went from working in a law office while in high school to graduating from UC Berkeley with an English degree, earning her Doctor of Jurisprudence from Golden Gate University School of Law, and practicing as an attorney for five years, specializing in civil rights litigation, employment law, and criminal defense.</p>
<p>Now Marlowe is the new UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/about/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=smarlowe">Campus Diversity Officer for Staff and Students</a>.</p>
<p>"I believe that I made a difference practicing law, but it was limited to litigation," she says. "You have such a short time to spend with your client, and once they leave, you've either gotten them acquitted or they're convicted, and that's it. Or with civil litigation, you either win or lose a case or you get a settlement, and that's that."</p>
<p>As a lawyer, she did admirable work, building cases and taking them to court. But it wasn't enough at that juncture of her career and professional life.</p>
<p>"I wanted impact beyond individual cases, and when I realized that I could do that in a different field - in diversity and higher education - I resigned from my job as a lawyer, cold turkey."</p>
<h2>Advancing institutional change</h2>
<p>Within this emerging field of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education, Marlowe promotes institutional change for historically marginalized communities, which at UC Santa Cruz includes African American students, transgender students, and students with disabilities.</p>
<p>She also wants to work toward achieving compositional diversity on campus, where there were only 37 other black staff members - 2 percent - when she was hired as assistant campus diversity officer in 2013.</p>
<p>But diversity has so many more dimensions, she says.</p>
<p>"I come from a unique perspective with my own experiences, but no matter who you are, you come from diverse perspectives, from different familial backgrounds, social-economic statuses, political views, religious differences," Marlowe said. "Everybody needs to be part of this conversation, and we have a shared sense of responsibility."</p>
<p>Last year, Marlowe represented the University of California by testifying before the state Legislature as a policy expert addressing best practices for fostering such values.</p>
<p>In response to the findings of the <a href="http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/what-is-campus-climate/index.html">UC Campus Climate Study</a> that were released in 2014, Marlowe was selected to lead the local effort to develop a campus action plan with regard to diversity, respect, and inclusion. That led to her serving as a co-leader in the <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/black_experience_team/index.html">Black Experience Team</a>, which advises the chancellor and campus provost on ongoing recruitment, retention, and campus climate strategies surrounding African American, Black, and Caribbean students.</p>
<h2>Proactive engagement</h2>
<p>Marlowe says she's already getting praise and criticism, something she acknowledges is an occupational hazard.</p>
<p>Her colleague, Assistant Director for Equal Employment Opportunity Ciel Benedetto, agreed.</p>
<p>"Diversity work is not for the faint of heart," Benedetto said. "It is a high risk/high reward occupation."</p>
<p>One of Marlowe's duties is to manage bias-related matters that have been reported on the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu">Report Hate website</a>. She says she has a deep conviction to address those concerns raised on campus.</p>
<p>"When speech or a bias incident takes place that doesn't adhere to our values and principles of community, we want to respond with proactive engagement," she said. "We try to educate the community, provide resources, and refer to appropriate campus units for policy review and possible disciplinary action. It's difficult to strike a balance when some expect disciplinary action, but the speech is protected."</p>
<p>Across the country, racially charged events have triggered a surge of student activism, tension, and threats of violence on college campuses. When Marlowe hears about those incidents, she's determined to provide even more resources, support, public speaking, and training - all in an effort to be an agent of change.</p>
<p>"We can't solve national issues on our campus, but we can have courageous dialogues," she said. "Our job as a university is to make sure everyone can thrive academically and socially, and to create a safe and welcoming environment to the best of our ability. We need to be able to talk about what's happening nationally, and to be purposeful and intentional with what we do to affect people's lives."</p>
<p>Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni said Marlowe's distinctive background makes her a great fit for the job.</p>
<p>"Sheree is uniquely positioned to do her job, because she understands the law and the constraint it brings but still has the passion for diversity and inclusion work," Sahni said.</p>
<p>Does she still use her skill set as a lawyer? All the time.</p>
<p>"I look at trends and data," she said. "I still do policy analysis and review programs. I approach things very strategically, but also with intention. I guess the difference now is that I get to experience the change beyond the courtroom. My hope is that my efforts will help today's students, staff, or faculty and the generations to come."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="39ee8bab80727017266c9f812a08735e"><name>flash-crash</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New paper examines the details behind stock market 'flash crash'</title><summary>A paper by UC Santa Cruz professors of economics and astrophysics has attracted widespread attention in the financial world over its analysis of the “flash crash” nearly six years ago that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1,000 points in less than five minutes.</summary><start-date>1456966800000</start-date><display-name>Flash crash</display-name><path>/2016/03/flash-crash</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/flash-crash</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1456965840666</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457026516970</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/flash-crash-520.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/flash-crash-520.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>flash-crash-520.jpg</name><display-name>flash-crash-520.jpg</display-name><file-size>68901</file-size><width>520</width><height>193</height></image><image-alt>flash crash graph</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/flash-crash-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/flash-crash-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>flash-crash-80.jpg</name><display-name>flash-crash-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7797</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>flash crash chart</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The chart shows prices for the SPDR S&amp;P 500, the most popular exchange traded fund in the world, on different electronic markets during the flash crash over a four-minute interval on May 6, 2010.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Conclusions: Indicted trader not to blame; systemic issues of high-frequency trading more likely responsible for 1,000-point drop</article-subhead><article-text><p>A paper by UC Santa Cruz professors of economics and astrophysics has attracted widespread attention in the financial world over its analysis of the &#8220;flash crash&#8221; nearly six years ago that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1,000 points in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2721922">The Flash Crash: A New Deconstruction</a>&#8221; by Eric Aldrich, assistant professor of economics, and Greg Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, along with a colleague at Stanford University Law School, looks at the practice of high-frequency computerized trading. Specifically, they take a granular-level investigation of the trades leading up to the May 6, 2010 crash that temporarily wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market value.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue trader</strong></p>
<p>What has garnered the most attention is the authors&#8217; theory that a British trader, who has been indicted on charges of causing the flash crash, is most likely not responsible. The trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, is facing extradition to the United States after being arrested last April. &#160;</p>
<p>Aldrich said that since the paper became public more than a month ago he&#8217;s been hearing from market analysts and technicians interested in the paper&#8217;s assertions. It was also widely reported in the financial press.</p>
<p>He and coauthors continue to investigate. With seed funding from the Center for Analytical Finance at UC Santa Cruz, Aldrich and colleagues will further explore the impact of high-frequency trading with a simulated exchange that can replicate market conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really intrigued with last April&#8217;s announcement that Sarao was being indicted,&#8221; Aldrich said. &#160;&#8220;It caught everybody off guard. Could one guy really have done this?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>We have the data</strong></p>
<p>Aldrich said he and Laughlin realized they had the data to analyze individual market trades leading up to the crash. Less than a year earlier, with UCSC physics undergraduate student Indra Heckenbach, they released a paper, &#8220;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2481201">The Random Walk of High-Frequency Trading</a>,&#8221; that looked at high-frequency trading and the limits of time in terms of reporting trades.</p>
<p>After the April 2015 indictment of Sarao, Aldrich and his coauthors combed through court documents that U.S. prosecutors had filed and also took a close look at the trading data they had compiled for their earlier paper.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities have accused Sarao of &#8220;spoofing,&#8221; manipulating the market by using an automated process to place a large number of sell orders, thus driving prices down, then cancelling them. He then could swoop in to buy securities at the artificially reduced prices and sell once they rose again. He&#8217;s alleged to have profited $850,000 on the flash crash day.</p>
<p><strong>Spoofing allegations spot on</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Allegations of spoofing are 100 percent correct,&#8221; Aldrich says, but that&#8217;s not what caused the flash crash. "Indeed, this paper suggests that the flash crash could have occurred even without Sarao's presence in the market," Aldrich and co-authors write.</p>
<p>Instead they suggest that weakness in the trade-reporting infrastructure may have played a significant part. They use millisecond analysis both in terms of executed trades and, more importantly, in terms of data feeds as reporting of trades were being delayed by as much as 90 seconds.&#160;</p>
<p>The paper asserts that unsettled market conditions early in the day, combined with a huge sell order for the popular E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures security by mutual fund manager Waddell &amp; Reed helped trigger the sell-off. They point to and agree with a 2010 joint report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission that came to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>The authors say they are concerned that regulators will focus on spoofing activities as an effective substitute to avoid future flash crashes rather than a more fundamental restructuring of markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work instead suggests that policymakers interested in reducing the probability of a future Flash Crash are better guided by the findings of the joint CFTC-SEC staff report, which does not rely on Sarao's presence in the market,&#8221; the paper states.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2721922</url><title>The Flash Crash: A New Deconstruction</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2481201</url><title>The Random Walk of High-Frequency Trading</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cafin.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/friedman-hft-study.html</url><title>New study will put high frequency trading to the test</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cafin.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Center for Analytical Finance</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d41b2b280727017266c9f81cf5b0fa6"><name>galaxy-record</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers break cosmic distance record (again)</title><summary>UCSC astronomer Garth Illingworth and his collaborators have been pushing the limits of current telescopes to study the most distant galaxies, breaking the record twice within a year </summary><keywords>Garth Illingworth, most distant galaxy, GN-z11, Hubble Space Telescope</keywords><start-date>1457024400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers break cosmic distance record (again)</display-name><path>/2016/03/galaxy-record</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/galaxy-record</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1457021629064</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457466632251</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><script src="http://hubblesite.org/lib/share_video.php?u=/hu/db/videos/hs-2016-07-a-flash_video_16x9.flv&amp;t=/hu/db/2016/07/videos/a/flash_preview.jpg&amp;w=448&amp;h=252" type="text/javascript">

This surprisingly bright, infant galaxy, named GN-z11, is seen as it was 13.4 billion years in the past, just 400 million years after the big bang.</p>
<p>The investigation of GN-z11, which is located in the direction of the constellation of Ursa Major, was led by astronomers at UC Santa Cruz, Yale University, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). The team's findings will be published March 8 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>, and the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00461">paper is now available online at arxiv.org</a>. This comes less than a year after <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/farthest-galaxy.html">the same team broke the galaxy distance record in May 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Coauthor Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said the team pushed NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to its limits to get the spectroscopic data needed to determine the galaxy's "redshift," a measure of its distance from Earth. The new Hubble observations take astronomers into a realm that was once thought to be only reachable with NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
<p>"It's remarkable that Hubble could do this," Illingworth said. "This new discovery shows that the Webb telescope will surely find many such young galaxies reaching back to when the first galaxies were forming."</p>
<p>"We've taken a major step back in time, beyond what we'd ever expected to be able to do with Hubble," said first author Pascal Oesch of Yale University. It takes so long for light from GN-z11 to reach our telescopes that we see the galaxy as it was when the universe was only 3 percent of its current age, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpectedly bright</strong></p>
<p>This measurement provides strong evidence that some unusual and unexpectedly bright galaxies found earlier in Hubble images are really at extraordinary distances. Previously, the team had estimated GN-z11's distance by photometric techniques, using filters to measure light at different wavelengths with Hubble and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Now, for the first time for a galaxy at such an extreme distance, the team used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to precisely measure the distance to GN-z11 spectroscopically by splitting the light into its component colors.</p>
<p>Astronomers measure cosmic distances by determining the redshift of a galaxy. Due to the expansion of the universe, every distant object appears to be receding from us because its light is stretched to longer, redder wavelengths as it travels through expanding space to reach our telescopes. The greater the redshift, the farther the galaxy.</p>
<p>"Our spectroscopic observations reveal the galaxy to be even farther away than we had originally thought, right at the distance limit of what Hubble can observe," said coauthor Gabriel Brammer of the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p>Before astronomers determined the distance for GN-z11, the most distant galaxy measured spectroscopically had a redshift of 8.68 (13.2 billion years in the past). Now, the team has confirmed GN-z11 to be at a redshift of 11.1, nearly 200 million years closer to the time of the big bang. "This is an extraordinary accomplishment for Hubble. It managed to beat all the previous distance records held for years by much larger ground-based telescopes," said investigator Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University. "This new record will likely stand until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope."</p>
<p><strong>Rapid growth</strong></p>
<p>The combination of Hubble's and Spitzer's imaging reveals that GN-z11 is 25 times smaller than the Milky Way and has just one percent of our galaxy's mass in stars. However, the newborn GN-z11 is growing fast, forming stars at a rate about 20 times greater than our galaxy does today. This makes such an extremely remote galaxy bright enough for astronomers to find and perform detailed observations with both Hubble and Spitzer. The results reveal surprising new clues about the nature of the very early universe.</p>
<p>"It's amazing that a galaxy so massive existed only 200 million to 300 million years after the very first stars started to form. It takes really fast growth, producing stars at a huge rate, to have formed a galaxy that is a billion solar masses so soon," Illingworth said.</p>
<p>These findings provide a tantalizing preview of the observations that the James Webb Space Telescope will perform after it is launched into space in 2018. The discovery also has important consequences for NASA's planned Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), which will have the ability to find thousands of such bright, very distant galaxies.</p>

<p>Pettigrew joined the faculty in 1979 after teaching at the University of North Carolina and Harvard. He retired in 1994, but has continued to conduct research in social psychology. He has been at the forefront of studies of racial prejudice for more than five decades. An expert on black-white relations in the United States, he has also conducted intergroup research in Australia, Europe, and South Africa.</p>
<p>In 2009, he won the University of California's Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award for research accomplishments since retirement. At the time, he said he&#8217;d published more in the previous decade than any other decade in his career.</p>
<p>The Cox-Johnson-Frazier Award will be given at the ASA&#8217;s annual meeting in Seattle in August.</p>
<p>The ASA Council first established the DuBois-Johnson-Frazier Award in 1971 to honor the intellectual traditions and contributions of W.E.B. DuBois, Charles S. Johnson, and E. Franklin Frazier. In 2006, the association voted to change the name to the Cox-Johnson-Frazier Award in honor of Oliver Cox, the award&#8217;s first recipient.</p>
<p>It is given annually to an individual or individuals for their work in the intellectual traditions of the work of the three African American scholars. Cox, Johnson, and Frazier placed their scholarship in service to social justice, with an eye toward advancing the status of disadvantaged populations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="42ea631680727017266c9f81c09eb6f7"><name>vanpool-openings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Openings in Commuter Vanpool Program</title><summary>There are current openings in two UCSC vanpools:  one from Aptos, and one from the San Lorenzo Valley.</summary><start-date>1457078400000</start-date><display-name>Openings in Commuter Vanpool Program</display-name><path>/2016/03/vanpool-openings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/vanpool-openings</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1457116570356</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457116702664</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/25209624880_a99711d0bf_m.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/25209624880_a99711d0bf_m.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>25209624880_a99711d0bf_m.jpg</name><display-name>25209624880_a99711d0bf_m.jpg</display-name><file-size>25682</file-size><width>180</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span><span>There are current openings in two UCSC vanpools: &#160;one from Aptos, and one from the San Lorenzo Valley. Passengers in these vanpools have a work schedule of&#160;8:00am &#8211; 5:00pm&#160;and work at the main UCSC campus.&#160;If you are considering how to reduce your commute stress, fuel and parking expenses, vanpooling could be the answer.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span> Vanpooling is comprised of trained volunteer drivers (UCSC staff) who drive a UCSC 12-passenger vehicle. They meet passengers at a central location near their home and then drop them off at convenient stops on campus with enough time to get to their offices. At the end of the day, the vanpool does the reverse route bringing everyone home.&#160;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Passengers for these routes pay a monthly fee of $54 through pre-tax payroll deduction. Included in the program is a free Emergency Ride Home voucher that allows use of a taxi service when there is an unexpected need to leave the campus before the vanpool&#8217;s regular schedule. Passengers also get an average of four free parking permits per month for those days when a personal vehicle is needed for errands.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>As an introductory offer, TAPS encourages new passengers to try out the vanpool for a week without charge or obligation.</strong><br/>

 Since the beginning of his career, Delany has stretched the traditional boundaries of science fiction, creating highly imaginative works that address sexual, racial, and social issues, heroic quests, and the nature of language.<br/>
<br/>
 He has won four Nebula Awards, two Hugo Awards, and the William Whitehead Memorial Award for lifetime achievement. He is an inductee into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame and the winner of the Lambda Literary Pioneer Award.<br/>
<br/>
 In 2014, Delany also received the 31st Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master of Science Fiction Award.<br/>
<br/>
 As the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine noted in a feature story last summer titled <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/samuel-delany-and-the-past-and-future-of-science-fiction"><strong><em>Samuel Delany and the Past and Future of Science Fiction</em></strong></a>:<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Delany&#8217;s career now spans more than half a century, and comprises dozens of novels and short stories, many of which have challenged every notion of what science fiction could or should be. Even now, when graphic sex and challenging themes are hardly unusual, Delany&#8217;s rapturous sexuality and his explorations of race within the trappings of science fiction have the power to startle.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Delany&#8217;s novels include science fiction works such as <em>Nova, Dhalgren, The Fall of the Towers</em>, the Nebula-Award winning <em>Babel-17</em>, and <em>The Einstein Intersection</em>, as well as the four-volume fantasy series <em>Return to Neveryon</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 In 2008, his novel <em>Dark Reflections</em> won the Stonewall Book Award. He has also written <em>Phallos</em> and, most recently, <em>Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 Delany&#8217;s non-fiction includes three critical books on science fiction, <em>The Jewel-Hinged Jaw</em>, <em>Starboard Wine,</em> and <em>The American Shore</em>. He is the author of the widely-taught T<em>imes Square Red/Times Square Blue</em>, and he has written a Hugo Award-winning autobiography <em>The Motion of Light in Water</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 In 2007, Delany was the subject of a documentary film, <em>The Polymath, or The Life and Opinions of Samel R. Delany, Gentleman</em>, which had its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.</p>

<p>A new study by researchers affiliated with UC Santa Cruz and <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/02/18/biosci.biw003.full">published online</a> in the journal <em>BioScience</em> looks at how nitrogen affects threatened biodiversity across the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nitrogen pollution is a prevalent atmospheric and biogeo&#173;chemical global change driver, with growing effects on terres&#173;trial, aquatic, and coastal ecosystems,&#8221; the researchers write in &#8220;Nitrogen Pollution Is Linked to U.S. Listed Species Declines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It starts in the air and water,&#8221; said co-author Erika Zavaleta, Pepper-Giberson Chair in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;On land, nitrogen pollution ultimately ends up in the soil,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s essentially fertilizers coming out of air and water,&#8221; from smokestacks and auto tailpipes.</p>
<p>The authors surveyed 1,400 species listed under the Endangered Species Act, finding 78 that face known hazards from excess nitrogen. The mechanisms of nitrogen's impacts are diverse, encompassing direct toxicity, depleted oxygen resulting from excess fertilization, and incursions by invasive species that outcompete local populations or exclude their food sources.</p>
<p class="Default">Researchers included lead author Daniel Hern&#225;ndez who now teaches at Carleton College in Minnesota. Hern&#225;ndez, who worked as a post-doctoral researcher at UCSC in 2007-2008, will teach in the UCSC Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program this summer. Other UCSC affiliated authors include EPA scientist Dena Vallano, a former UCSC post doc, &#160;Zdravka Tzankova,&#160; assistant professor in environmental studies, Corinne Morozumi, &#160;environmental studies alumna, and Jae Pasari, Ph.D. in environmental studies, &#160;2011.</p>
<p>To zoom in on the problem in our area, the team looked at grasslands growing in serpentine outcroppings in fault areas of the East Bay and southern Santa Clara County where there are &#8220;rare and endemic plant and animal species you can&#8217;t find any other place in the world,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>Researchers looked at how nitrogen has accumulated over the last 150 years. They studied tree rings and used greenhouse experiments to see how adding more nitrogen affected rare plants that support a threatened butterfly, the Edith&#8217;s Bay checkerspot.</p>
<p>Nitrogen pollution is a challenging problem to address because it is very diffuse, coming from many different sources. &#8220;It&#8217;s a policy challenge and a conservation challenge,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>One challenge is that regulations have not kept pace with the steady growth of nitrogen pollution. Fertilizer use, leguminous crop agriculture, and fossil fuel burning have more than doubled the amount of global reactive nitrogen, and in the United States, human-derived nitrogen additions are thought to be fourfold greater than natural sources.</p>
<p>Despite this trend, "existing laws and policies to protect biodiversity were largely developed before these threats were fully recognized," the authors state.</p>
<p>If regulatory structures can be appropriately modernized, efforts to mitigate nitrogen's effects on endangered species may be fruitful, the authors write, because unlike global threats that resist local solutions, nitrogen pollution "can be more readily addressed within the boundaries of a single nation, region, or watershed."</p>
<p>The study was funded by a grant from the Kearney Foundation for Soil Science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/3/213</url><title>Article in 'BioScience'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://bioscienceaibs.libsyn.com/nitrogens-threat-to-biodiversity</url><title>BioScience podcast on the research with Zavaleta and Hernández</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="53d051ce80727017266c9f81b1162602"><name>christy-cowell-provost</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alan Christy named provost of Cowell College </title><summary>Associate professor of history Alan Christy has been named the new provost of Cowell College, effective July 1, 2016.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, cowell college, provosts</keywords><start-date>1457400300000</start-date><display-name>Alan Christy named provost of Cowell College </display-name><path>/2016/03/christy-cowell-provost</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/christy-cowell-provost</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1457400074663</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457400472650</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/alan-christy-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/alan-christy-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alan-christy-375.jpg</name><display-name>alan-christy-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>118314</file-size><width>375</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Alan Christy</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/alan-christy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/alan-christy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alan-christy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alan-christy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>31515</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alan Christy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Associate professor of history Alan Christy</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Associate professor of history Alan Christy has been named the new provost of Cowell College, effective July 1, 2016.<br/>
 <br/>
 Christy joined the History Department at UC Santa Cruz in 1995 as a specialist in Japanese and modern East Asian history. He served as the inaugural History Department undergraduate director, and for many years he has been the director of the East Asian Studies minor. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I am especially drawn to Cowell College for its esteemed place in the history of the campus, for its core course theme of &#8216;Imagining Justice,&#8217; and for the college&#8217;s motto: &#8216;The Pursuit of Truth in the Company of Friends,&#8217;" Christy noted. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Much of my teaching and research is devoted to the question of the relationship of historical knowledge to contemporary restorative justice,&#8221; he added.<br/>
 <br/>
 Christy won the Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award in the Humanities in 2012 and The Excellence in Teaching Award in 2014. He emphasizes the value of experiential learning and collaboration, and he is committed to the idea of a liberal arts education--interdisciplinary learning with a global reach. <br/>
 <br/>
 Christy is perhaps best known for the large class he teaches with associate history professor and Stevenson College provost Alice Yang, &#8220;Memories of WWII in the Pacific.&#8221; In this course, the students explore, through assigned readings and their own research projects, the many ways that changing perceptions of World War II have shaped the postwar world.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We try to bridge the perceived gap between the classroom and the broader world,&#8221; said Christy. &#8220;I&#8217;m really happy that so many students have come to take this class year after year.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 For the past five years, Christy has led large-scale collaborative public history research projects involving teams of faculty, staff and students here, as well as working with partners in Japan. His current effort, The Gail Project, employs a set of photographs--taken in Okinawa in 1952 by an American army captain--to explore the history of postwar Okinawan and American relationships under American military occupation. <br/>
 <br/>
 Christy received his B.A. at Carleton College in 1985 and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1996, in addition to conducting four years of fieldwork in rural Japan through Kanagawa University. <br/>
 <br/>
 He will succeed Faye Crosby, who has served as provost of Cowell College for the past six years</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="576b335e80727017266c9f8164ac8f44"><name>pohl-mooc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz launches online programming course by Ira Pohl</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has launched a new Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), C++ for C Programmers (Part A), on the Coursera platform.</summary><start-date>1457460000000</start-date><display-name>Ira Pohl MOOC</display-name><path>/2016/03/pohl-mooc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/pohl-mooc</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1457460556590</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457461756811</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/pohl-ira-225.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/pohl-ira-225.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pohl-ira-225.jpg</name><display-name>pohl-ira-225.jpg</display-name><file-size>36121</file-size><width>225</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt>ira pohl</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/pohl-ira-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/pohl-ira-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pohl-ira-80.jpg</name><display-name>pohl-ira-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6712</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>ira pohl</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor Ira Pohl</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has launched a new Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), C++ for C Programmers (Part A), on the Coursera platform.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/&#126;pohl/">Emeritus Professor of Computer Science Ira Pohl</a><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""></a>, the course is the first in a series of MOOCs Pohl has designed that will provide training for experienced C programmers who want to program in C++. The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-a">course</a> is available to anyone in the world with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Pohl has written widely on programming in C, C++, C# and Java. His MOOC on C++ will provide new opportunities for programmers looking to refine their skills or for additional training to further develop their careers. Pohl described his MOOC as "the distillation of three decades of teaching UCSC students C and C++."</p>
<p>UCSC has taken a faculty-led approach to developing online courses. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee said the campus joined Coursera to provide an opportunity for faculty who are interested in reaching a much larger audience through technology. MOOCs typically enroll thousands of students, often with more than half from other countries, and many from regions where access to first-class educational materials is scarce.</p>
<p>Over the past year there has been sizable growth in the development of credit-bearing online courses, and renewed faculty interest in developing MOOCs. UC Santa Cruz is currently developing MOOCs in the fields of statistics, psychology and environmental studies. A MOOC on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust">Holocaust</a> is currently being offered on Coursera.</p>

 <br/>
 The first forum will be 1 to 2 p.m. Tuesday, April 5; the second will be 6 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 6. Both will be in the Stevenson Event Center.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We recognize that the Stevenson and Cowell coffee shops hold a special place in many of your hearts," said Carolyn Golz, college administrative officer for both colleges. "We will be soliciting feedback from community members about the upcoming changes in hopes of determining the best program requirements to meet a variety of needs."<br/>
 <br/>
 The coffee shops at Cowell and Stevenson may be renovated later this year, part of an effort to reinvest in the facilities and potentially offer kosher and/or halal dining options.<br/>
 <br/>
 Beginning this summer, the coffee shops will be managed by UC Santa Cruz Dining Services. Both coffee shops have been operating with substantial and unsustainable deficits for many years, and have drawn funding away from meaningful college programming and facility upgrades.<br/>
 <br/>
 "While we have tried a variety of things to increase revenues and cut costs at the coffee shops, the deficits continue to grow," Golz said. <br/>
 <br/>
 The coffee shops will remain open and continue to serve the campus community, though renovation would mean one would be closed for improvements.<br/>
 <br/>
 Golz said the colleges have just begun planning. Stevenson is considering having kosher and/or halal dining options available in its coffee shop, something that larger dining halls can't offer.<br/>
 <br/>
 However, Golz said this program will require renovations and improvements to the Stevenson space, so the college may need to temporarily close the coffee shop after commencement and re-open once the improvements are complete, which could be as soon as January 2017.<br/>
 <br/>
 Once Stevenson re-opens, the Cowell Coffee Shop will undergo improvements and renovations. Golz said the colleges want to make sure that at least one facility is open to serve the community during the renovations.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We know that the community atmosphere, long hours of operation, and study space is important and we hope to maintain many of these elements, and more," Golz said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="579e8a6f80727017266c9f8165fc455a"><name>sexual-violence-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revised policy on sexual violence and sexual harassment and new online prevention courses</title><summary>The University of California (UC) Office of the President has issued an updated Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH Policy), which went into effect on January 1, 2016.

The SVSH Policy incorporates feedback and input from all levels of the university community and reflects the seriousness that UC attaches to the subject matter.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>The following are some of the revisions that have been made to the SVSH Policy:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>The definitions of sexual violence, sexual harassment, and other behavior prohibited under the SVSH Policy have changed.</li>
<li>The process for reporting complaints and for the university to respond to such reports is included.</li>
<li>A new definition of &#8220;responsible employee&#8221; has been added. It requires every employee of the university (except for a few confidential resources defined in the SVSH policy) to notify the Title IX office if they receive, in the course of their employment, information that a student has experienced sexual harassment, sexual violence, or other prohibited behavior.</li>
<li>Managers, supervisors, and faculty are &#8220;responsible employees&#8221; and required to notify the Title IX officer if, in the course of their employment, they receive information from any university community member (including other employees) about incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence, or other prohibited behavior.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New online courses for all university employees<br/>
</strong> As part of the university&#8217;s ongoing efforts to improve how it prevents and responds to sexual violence and sexual harassment on UC campuses, the Office of the President has developed two new eCourses specifically geared towards the new SVSH Policy. All university employees will be required to complete one of the online courses depending on their job status on campus. One course, designed for faculty and supervisors, will satisfy California law (AB1825) requirements. Both courses will cover the key concepts covered in the systemwide curriculum including:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Definitions of different forms of sexual violence</li>
<li>Social norms, including the attitudes and beliefs that can normalize violence</li>
<li>Bystander intervention</li>
<li>Responding to sexual violence using methods that acknowledge the impact of violence and trauma on survivors&#8217; lives</li>
<li>Local resources, including confidential support for survivors of sexual violence and appropriate services for those accused of sexual violence</li>
<li>Rights and options about reporting sexual violence.</li>
</ul>
The courses will be administrated through the UC Learning Center and completion will be tracked. The courses are accessible for people who are sight and hearing impaired. For more information about accessibility please go to <a href="https://home.campusclarity.com/accessibility-statement/">https://home.campusclarity.com/accessibility-statement/</a>. The UC Office of the President plans to create a Spanish version as well but has not yet given a timeline for its delivery. <br/>
 <br/>
 Faculty and supervisors&#8212;who have been required to take such courses every two years&#8212;will see new, updated content and will maintain their current training schedule. <br/>
 <br/>
 All other employees (including student employees) on payroll with active status, regardless of previous training taken, will be required to complete training on sexual violence/sexual harassment prevention and response. These non-supervisory employees will be required to complete the new course by May 1, 2016 (or within six weeks for any subsequent new hires) and annually thereafter.<br/>
 <br/>
 This training is a video-based course, delivered online through our UC Learning Center website at <a href="http://learningcenter.ucsc.edu">http://learningcenter.ucsc.edu</a>. The course should take approximately 50 minutes to complete for non-supervisor employees. Faculty and supervisors will continue to take a separate course with additional AB1825 content that will last two hours. All faculty and supervisors will be assigned the new SVSH prevention course on their normal anniversary training date.<br/>

<p>The award recognizes Zachos "for his groundbreaking contributions to documenting and understanding climate change throughout the Cenozoic." He will give the Milankovic Medal Lecture at the <a href="http://www.egu2016.eu/">EGU General Assembly</a> 2016 in Vienna, Austria, in April.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Zachos has been at the forefront of the fields of paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, working to understand the climates and marine environments of Earth's distant past. Layers of sediments deposited on the ocean floor hold evidence of past conditions, and Zachos has led studies of these clues that have reshaped scientists' views of long-term climate change and rapid climate transitions during the past 65 million years.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Global warming</strong></p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Zachos was among the first to recognize the importance of a rapid episode of global warming now called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). As the chief scientist on an Ocean Drilling Program expedition (ODP Leg 208) and lead author of a 2005 Science paper, he showed how deep-sea carbonate dissolution was influenced by a massive carbon release during the PETM. This work is highly relevant to understanding how human activities are driving modern-day global climate change.</p>
<p>Early in his career, Zachos contributed significantly to the understanding of the oceanic carbon cycle in the aftermath of a mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period 65.5 million years ago. His work on Antarctic glaciation across the Eocene-Oligocene transition and its effect on climate and the global carbon cycle resulted in landmark papers.</p>
<p>Zachos is also known for his work on climate change throughout the Cenozoic era, exemplified by an iconic graph of stable isotope measurements now known as the "Zachos curve." His high-resolution measurements enabled detailed studies of the relationship between climate cycles and variations in Earth's orbit around the sun. Astrophysicist Milutin Milankovic (for whom the Milankovic Medal is named) first proposed this relationship in the 1920s.</p>
<p>"Through several ground-breaking contributions, Zachos fundamentally transformed our understanding of climate change throughout the Cenozoic and made a sustained impact within, and far beyond, the boundaries of palaeoceanography," stated an <a href="http://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/milutin-milankovic/2016/james-c-zachos/">EGU announcement</a> of the award.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1957.html</url><title>Past greenhouse warming events provide clues to what the future may hold</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2006/02/816.html</url><title> Studies of ancient climates suggest Earth is now on a fast track to global warming</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2005/06/706.html</url><title>New findings show a slow recovery from extreme global warming episode 55 million years ago</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="581b866b80727017266c9f81c3a5231c"><name>bats-resistance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bats in Asia found to have resistance to white-nose syndrome fungus</title><summary>Some declining North American bat species could eventually evolve resistance to the devastating disease, scientists say.</summary><keywords>Marm Kilpatrick, Winifred Frick, white-nose syndrome, bats, Joseph Hoyt, Kate Langwig</keywords><start-date>1457510460000</start-date><display-name>Bats in Asia found to have resistance to white-nose syndrome fungus</display-name><path>/2016/03/bats-resistance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/bats-resistance</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1457472112188</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459365197344</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/hoyt-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/hoyt-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hoyt-400.jpg</name><display-name>hoyt-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>79489</file-size><width>400</width><height>279</height></image><image-alt>Joseph Hoyt</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/hoyt-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/hoyt-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hoyt-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hoyt-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20040</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Joseph Hoyt</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Joseph Hoyt swabs a cluster of greater tube-nosed bats <em>(Murina leucogaster)</em> in northeast China.

<p>By comparing disease dynamics in North American and Asian bat populations, researchers have found evidence that Asian bat species have much lower levels of infection than North American species and therefore are resistant to the fungus. The study, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1826/20152861">published March 9 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, also suggests that some declining North American bat species may be able to evolve enough resistance to the disease to persist, while other species appear less likely to do so.</p>
<p>Led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, an international team sampled hibernating bats at five sites in China and five sites in the United States, using a standardized swabbing technique to detect and quantify the amount of fungus on each bat.</p>
<p>"Uniformly, across all the species we sampled in China, we found much lower levels of infection--both the fraction of bats infected and the amount of fungus on infected bats were lower than in North America," said first author Joseph Hoyt, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Co-first author Kate Langwig, a former UCSC graduate student now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, said the team collected samples from bats at hibernation sites in Northeastern China and the Midwestern United States where the latitude and winter climate are very similar. The fungus that causes white-nose syndrome is endemic in Asia and Europe, so bats there have coexisted with it for a long time, whereas the disease only recently invaded North America, where it was first discovered in 2006.</p>
<p>"This is the first study to compare disease dynamics in an endemic region and a region where the pathogen is invading, and the results can help us understand the course it might take in North America," Hoyt said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Host resistance</strong></p>
<p>The researchers considered four possible hypotheses for the ability of Asian bats to persist with the fungus: host resistance, host tolerance, lower transmission due to smaller populations, or lower fungal growth rates due to environmental factors. Their results pointed toward host resistance and did not support the other hypotheses, Hoyt said.</p>
<p>The variation in infection intensity observed within some North American species, such as the little brown bat, may be a hopeful sign, he said. Overall, little brown bats had much higher levels of infection than Asian bats, but some individual little brown bats had relatively low fungal loads. If the variation is a result of genetic differences, it could lead to the evolution of resistance in that species.</p>
<p>Langwig noted that one North American species, big brown bats, have not suffered as dramatically from the disease as other North American species. In contrast, northern long-eared bats, which showed very low variability in fungal loads, have experienced drastic population declines.</p>
<p>"The northern long-eared bat suffers really high fungal loads, and nearly all individuals are infected--there's no overlap with the Asian species," Langwig said. "From previous work, we've seen their populations crashing toward extinction, so it could be a poor omen for that species."</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying the resistance of Asian bat species remain unknown. "It doesn't have to be the same strategy for every species--it could be differences in the skin microbiome in one and hibernation behavior in another--but we just don't have those details yet," Langwig said.</p>
<p>In addition to Hoyt and Langwig, the coauthors of the paper include Winifred Frick and Marm Kilpatrick, both faculty members in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UC Santa Cruz; Keping Sun, Guanjun Lu, Tinglei Jiang, and Jiang Feng at Northeast Normal University, China; and Katy Parise and Jeffrey Foster at University of New Hampshire.

Lagattuta)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC's Department of Computer Science is producing successful female graduates at a time when women remain underrepresented in the tech workforce</article-subhead><article-text><p class="Body">As an undergraduate in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Alexandra Holloway dismantled an old hard drive and reassembled it without a cover, exposing the spinning internal components so other students could see how it worked. Her professor, Darrell Long, was impressed, and he used her reconfigured device for a classroom demonstration.</p>
<p class="Body">"That really helped me show the other students where the action was," said Long, the Malavalli Professor of Storage Systems Research and director of the <a href="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/">Storage Systems Research Center</a> (SSRC) at UC Santa Cruz. Years later, he would become Holloway's Ph.D. adviser.</p>
<p class="Body">When she finished her Ph.D. in 2015, Holloway joined a growing number of women earning graduate degrees in computer science from UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. She was one of three women earning computer science Ph.D.s in 2015 who were advised by Long and another UCSC data storage expert, Ethan Miller, the Veritas Professor of Storage. Seven women advised by Long or Miller have earned their Ph.D.s over the past five years.</p>
<p class="Body">According to the American Association of University Women, just 12 percent of engineers are women, and the number of women in computing fell from 35 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 2013. At UC Santa Cruz, a number of programs in the Baskin School of Engineering are working to recruit and retain more women students in computer science and computer engineering, including <a href="https://awesome.soe.ucsc.edu/">Project Awesome</a>, <a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/">Girls in Engineering</a>, and ongoing collaborations with the <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/">National Center for Women and Information Technology</a>.</p>
<p class="Body">In graduate school, however, individual faculty advisers have an enormous influence on their students' experiences, and Long's students say his lab is unusually diverse and supportive. In 2011, Long received a Chancellor's Achievement Award for Diversity after one of his students nominated him for the award.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Positive experience</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Aleatha Parker-Wood, who completed her Ph.D. in Long's lab in 2013, credits much of her positive graduate school experience to Long's support as an adviser and the lab environment he fostered.</p>
<p class="Body">"Darrell has done more for women, minorities, and people of all stripes than anyone I know," said Parker-Wood. "The lab has more diversity in terms of race, gender, and sexual orientation than any other lab I can think of, and that's mostly because of Darrell."</p>
<p class="Body">Long said that he strives to facilitate camaraderie among his students, and that his only requirement of them is that they work diligently. "I just try to be supportive and understanding," he said. "My students are like my kids.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Body">Like Holloway, Parker-Wood first came to Long's attention as an undergraduate in his introductory computer science class. He encouraged both of them to pursue graduate degrees at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="Body">Holloway comes from a line of female engineers, beginning with her grandmother; she and her family immigrated to the United States as political refugees from the Soviet Union. Holloway showed an early interest in technology--as a young girl, she once disassembled all the doorknobs in her mother's home after discovering how screwdrivers work. "My mother was not pleased," she said.</p>
<p class="Body">In high school, Holloway took auto shop and bought and restored a 1972 Chevy Nova. Around the same time, she started building her own computers, a hobby that made dissecting hard drives a natural skill. "I still remember Darrell being appalled that some of the other students had never taken their own computers apart," she said.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Gender imbalance</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Holloway earned her bachelor's degrees in 2003 and worked as a software engineer in San Diego for three years before returning to UCSC for graduate school. Only then did she begin noticing that she had long been one of the few women in her classes. "It took me so long to notice the gender imbalance," she said. "I thought I was just good at making friends with boys."</p>
<p class="Body">At first, she regarded the disparity as a non-issue. But after she became pregnant, she realized that women experience a whole suite of challenges that men never face. Undeterred, Holloway made pregnancy and childbirth the focus of a research project. Working with Sri Kurniawan, associate professor of computer engineering and computational media, she developed a video game called <em>Prepared Partner</em> as a training tool for childbirth support, intended for couples who couldn't afford or weren't interested in traditional birthing classes.</p>
<p class="Body">After earning her M.S. with Kurniawan, Holloway transitioned to Long's lab to complete her Ph.D. There, she began focusing on file systems and human-computer interaction. Today, she works for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where she studies how pilots interact with tools like the Mars rovers and the Deep Space Network, NASA's international array of giant radio antennas that supports spacecraft missions. Holloway works to make these tools easier to use.</p>
<p class="Body">"This is totally my dream job," she said. "I'll never leave."</p>
<p class="Body">Unlike Holloway, Parker-Wood immediately noticed the lack of women in the first computer science courses she took in Idaho during the 1990s. "I would walk into my classes and be the only woman in a room of 40 men. Everyone would stare at me, including the professor," she recalled.</p>
<p class="Body">Now a principal research engineer at Symantec in Mountain View, Parker-Wood came to UCSC after working in Silicon Valley as a software engineer without a bachelor's degree. "This was in 2000 during the dotcom boom, and they were hiring anyone with a pulse, so I thought, 'Let's give it a shot!'"</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Refreshing atmosphere</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Transferring to UCSC after her stint in the Valley, Parker-Wood said the difference in atmosphere from her early experiences was refreshing. "The entire computer science department is full of good people who are warm and supportive," she said. "I felt welcome."</p>
<p class="Body">When Long first encouraged Parker-Wood to pursue graduate school, she balked at the prospect of more coursework. "I thought he was crazy," she said. "I just wanted to finish my degree and get back to work!"</p>
<p class="Body">She eventually reconsidered, however, and decided she wanted to study natural language processing before returning to industry. She asked Long to write letters of recommendation for the many applications she was putting together. He agreed, but on one condition: she also had to apply to UC Santa Cruz to work in his lab.</p>
<p class="Body">Though Parker-Wood received acceptance letters from many other graduate schools, she chose to stay in Santa Cruz. Under Long, she worked with scientists from many different fields, from geophysics to bioinformatics, helping them to better navigate and assess huge datasets.</p>
<p class="Body">Just as she began interning at IBM in 2010, where she researched and streamlined their file systems, Parker-Wood became pregnant. She announced her Ph.D. candidacy just ten months after her daughter was born. "That was probably the most complicated 18 months of my life, both being pregnant and the first year after my daughter was born," she said. "I spent a lot of my time balancing a baby in one arm and a laptop in the other."</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>&#65279;No regrets</strong></p>
<p class="Body">At Symantec, she now applies her expertise in machine learning and file systems to help companies enhance their digital security. Though her winding career path did not go as she first expected, she's glad for the outcome. "Instead of earning a Ph.D. in language processing, I went to a file systems lab. It totally altered the arc of my graduate career, but it was fantastic. I have absolutely no regrets," she said.</p>
<p class="Body">Graduate students working with Long and Miller benefit from their longstanding relationships with leading companies in the computer and data storage industries, maintained through the SSRC, which Long directs, and the <a href="http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> (CRSS), which Miller directs. Their students have opportunities to work on problems important to industry, and many of them receive job offers before they've earned their degrees. Miller's student Rekha Pitchumani, for example, had offers from Seagate, where she did an internship, and after earning her Ph.D. in 2015, she took a senior engineer position at Samsung Semiconductor.</p>
<p class="Body">In 2016, several more women are expected to earn Ph.D. degrees in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, including Stephanie Jones, who has been working with Long on advanced storage systems. Jones, who recently accepted a job offer from Intel, said graduate school felt like a long and arduous journey, but she's grateful for where it has led her.</p>
<p class="Body">"Looking back, it's easy to say that I worked more nights, weekends, and 14-hour workdays than I'd like to count," she said. "But looking at the grander scheme of things, I met a lot of good people, I made good contacts, and I'm working a job that I love."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="617dd74f80727017266c9f81ef4bae8b"><name>groundwater-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC researchers publish roadmap for successful groundwater governance</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz hydrologist Andrew Fisher coauthored recommendations for forming Groundwater Sustainability Agencies.</summary><keywords>Andrew Fisher, groundwater, Groundwater Sustainabililty Agencies, SGMA, UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</keywords><start-date>1457596800000</start-date><display-name>UC researchers publish roadmap for successful groundwater governance</display-name><path>/2016/03/groundwater-report</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/groundwater-report</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1457629550375</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1458576157290</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/diagram-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/diagram-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diagram-425.jpg</name><display-name>diagram-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>92073</file-size><width>425</width><height>475</height></image><image-alt>diagram of report recommendations</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/diagram-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/diagram-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diagram-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>diagram-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20532</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>diagram of report recommendations</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The report outlines nine criteria for successful Groundwater Sustainability Agencies.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/fisher-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/fisher-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fisher-400.jpg</name><display-name>fisher-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>132321</file-size><width>400</width><height>376</height></image><image-alt>Fisher and another researcher taking water measurements</image-alt><image-caption><p>Andrew Fisher (left) has been studying the interactions between surface water and groundwater in the Pajaro Valley for 20 years.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz hydrologist Andrew Fisher coauthored comprehensive recommendations for forming Groundwater Sustainability Agencies in California </article-subhead><article-text><p>California has not managed or regulated groundwater use on a statewide basis for most of its history, and many of the state's aquifers have been depleted by overpumping. A team of experts led by UC faculty has now published a report that describes a path forward for successful groundwater management.</p>
<p>With the passage of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) in 2014, local governments across the state will be establishing Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) to implement a state policy of managing groundwater resources sustainably. SGMA, however, does not give any specific guidance for the design and structure of these new agencies. The new report, "<a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/wheeler/groundwater-governance-criteria/">Designing Effective Groundwater Sustainability Agencies</a>," explains how nine critical factors will determine the success or failure of the Groundwater Sustainability Agencies.</p>
<p>Coauthor Andrew Fisher, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is the UCSC campus lead for the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a>. He worked on the report with colleagues in the initiative and at UC Berkeley, UC's Hastings College of Law, the Union of Concerned Scientists, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and University of Idaho.</p>
<p>"California has been overpumping groundwater for decades, by millions of acre-feet per year, with aquifers supplying 30 to 40 percent of freshwater needs across the state," Fisher said. "In the Central Coast region, extending from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara, we rely on groundwater for about 85 percent of our needs."</p>
<p><strong>Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity</strong></p>
<p>The drought has made groundwater overdraft worse in many basins, leading to subsidence of the ground, collapse of aquifers, and (along the coast) seawater intrusion. "SGMA provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change how groundwater resources are managed and to put basins on a path towards water security," Fisher said.</p>
<p>The challenge is that GSAs are being organized quickly, and many will have to show rapid progress in developing and implementing plans for basin management. According to the report, if the GSAs are not set up correctly, taking into account the needs and interests of diverse populations, the new agencies will not succeed.</p>
<p>The report's lead author, Michael Kiparsky, is the UC Berkeley campus director for the UC Water initiative and director of the Wheeler Water Institute at Berkeley's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment. According to Kiparsky, SGMA is "the most significant water legislation to have come to California in decades," providing a "tremendous opportunity." But care must be taken to establish effective GSAs, he said.</p>
<p>"It's more difficult to change an agency that has already been created and started to do its work than it is to try and create that agency with the right structure in the first place," Kiparsky said.</p>
<p>The new report describes linked criteria that support two main goals for effective groundwater management: efficacy and fairness. The nine criteria for successful GSAs include human <em>capacity</em> (having enough people with the right skills); reliable <em>funding</em> streams to support management and monitoring efforts; <em>representation</em> of diverse interests; <em>transparency</em> in decision making to build and maintain trust; and <em>independence</em>, with mechanisms to protect the agency from external pressures.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Fisher is also collaborating with regional partners to identify locations and create projects that will help to put more water into overstressed aquifers.</p>
<p>"This region has been working for decades to meet requirements that are only now being imposed on other parts of the state," he said. "We are not part of big surface water transfer systems, so we have to make do with what we have."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/parched-california-tries-to-grab-storm-water-before-it-escapes/</url><title>Parched California tries to grab storm water before it escapes</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/wheeler/groundwater-governance-criteria/</url><title>Designing Effective Groundwater Sustainability Agencies</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6189259580727017266c9f817935b520"><name>sutdents-arrested</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Six students arrested on drug charges</title><summary>Six UC Santa Cruz students have been arrested on drug charges related to the possession for sale of large amounts of MDMA.</summary><start-date>1457424000000</start-date><display-name>Six students arrested on drug charges</display-name><path>/2016/03/sutdents-arrested</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/sutdents-arrested</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1457630291304</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457649979229</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>It is deeply troubling to share news that six UC Santa Cruz students have been arrested on drug charges related to the possession for sale of large amounts of MDMA, commonly known as "Ecstasy."<br/>

<br/>
 Over 150 boxes containing programs, artwork, photographs, scores, correspondence, business papers and tapes from such renowned composers as Terry Riley, Elliott Carter, Pauline Oliveros,&#160;Pierre Boulez, Meredith Monk, Anthony Braxton, and Brian Eno have already been transferred to Special Collections and Archives at McHenry Library on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
 About 4,000 reel-to reel, cassette, DAT, and video tapes of interviews and live performances from KPFA, entrusted to Other Minds, will additionally be delivered to UCSC this summer&#8212;including more than 30 years of Cabrillo Festival performance and interview tapes. The recordings&#8212;all one-of-a-kind documents, mostly made on reel-to-reel tape&#8212;cover the period between 1949 and 1995.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We wanted to give the archives to a place where we could be assured that the contents will be safe and used by music faculty and researchers,&#8221; noted Charles Amirkhanian, the executive and artistic director of Other Minds.<br/>
<br/>
 "The music faculty of UC Santa Cruz shares my interest in the line of composers stemming from the experimentalism of Henry Cowell, John Cage and Lou Harrison&#8212;composers who re-imagined every parameter of music, rather than creating their music strictly within confines of the Western European classical tradition."</p>
<p>"Living and working far from New York and Europe, these composers were free to absorb influences from non-Western culture that ushered in the first wave of a distinctly American music."</p>
<p>KPFA, America's first listener-sponsored radio station, founded in 1949, had a long history of hiring composers as music directors, beginning in the early 50's with Robert Erickson, teacher of Terry Riley, Morton Subotnick, Pauline Oliveros and others who went on to invent minimal music and live electronic music.</p>
<p>The station even maintained a satellite studio for live concerts at the famed San Francisco Tape Music Center on 321 Divisadero Street where Riley premiered "In C" in 1964. Henry Cowell played inside the strings of the station's piano back in 1949, and there is sound from a transcription disc of that performance included in the collection.</p>
<p>A composer who was also music director of KPFA in Berkeley for 23 years, Amirkhanian founded Other Minds two decades ago as a gathering place for composers&#8212;primarily through presenting an annual festival of experimental jazz and classical music with all guest composers present.<br/>
<br/>
 Since its inception, the Other Minds Festival has presented nearly 200 composers from around the globe, with early festivals including performances from Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass, and Ned Rorem.<br/>
<br/>
 Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections and Archives at UC Santa Cruz, noted that the Other Minds archives are a perfect fit for the Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Special Collections already holds the archives of composer Lou Harrison and the mycology collection of composer John Cage,&#8221; said Remak-Honnef. &#8220;And the UC Santa Cruz music department is well-known for its strengths in new and experimental music&#8212;professor Leta Miller is a major authority on Lou Harrison, and professors Amy Beal and Larry Polansky are experts in the area of the American Experimental Tradition.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 In fact, Polansky&#8217;s compositions were featured at the Other Minds 21st annual festival at the SFJAZZ Center which concluded on March 6. Guitarists Polansky, Giacomo Fiore, and Elliot Simpson performed three of Polansky&#8217;s works for electric guitar.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The Other Minds archive is probably the most important collection of Western contemporary music in the United States of the 20th and 21st centuries,&#8221; said Polansky.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It represents a huge body of work that really spans the entire world and what happened in experimental and contemporary music in the last 50 years, as viewed from our West Coast perspective,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And it includes everybody. There's nobody of any import who didn't cross paths with Charles, KPFA, and Other Minds during those years.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Remak-Honnef said that fundraising is now underway to hire a project archivist to catalog the archive and to support the digitization and preservation of over 30 years of Cabrillo Festival performance and interview tapes. She estimated that the archive would be made available to the public by 2019.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;By digitizing the tapes, we will preserve them for future generations of scholars, musicians and music lovers,&#8221; said Remak-Honnef. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz faculty and graduate students will be able to use the collection for both research and teaching.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We will be holding onto a treasure trove of materials pertaining to contemporary living composers whose final reputation has not yet been determined,&#8221; Remak-Honnef added. &#8220;Who will decide what kind of music was really ahead of its time? Librarians and archivists need to make educated decisions about materials that may become even more important long after our own lifetimes.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62b3119f80727017266c9f8189f4a9cf"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Police activity on campus today</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received multiple reports of concerning information about a student's behavior, which may have put the student at risk.</summary><start-date>1457510400000</start-date><display-name>Police activity on campus today</display-name><path>/2016/03/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/news-article</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1457649815927</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1457649869860</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received multiple reports of concerning information about a student's behavior, which may have put the student at risk.

 <br/>
 As a reminder, the new retirement benefits will apply only to UC employees hired on or after July 1, 2016. Current employees and retirees are unaffected by these changes as accrued pension benefits are protected by law and cannot be reduced or revoked.<br/>
 <br/>
 Before getting into the specifics of my proposal, I want to share with you my thinking behind it.<br/>
 <br/>
 The University of California is a very special institution. There are other fine universities, but there is no other university on the planet that contributes as much to the public, in as many ways as UC does. Arguably, no other single institution does as much for so many.<br/>
 <br/>
 And at the heart of everything we do, and the excellence UC is renowned for, are our talented faculty and staff. Our people are what make UC great.<br/>
 <br/>
 Maintaining excellence on such a massive scale is no small task. And it does not come cheaply.<br/>
 <br/>
 Everything we do &#8211; from teaching students, to treating patients and training the next generation of doctors, to redefining the boundaries of what we know, to creating technologies that give rise to new industries, to helping to ensure the vitality of California&#8217;s agricultural resources, and everything in between, requires significant financial resources.<br/>
 <br/>
 When I accepted the opportunity to lead UC two and a half years ago, it was clear to me that one of the most important goals of my presidency would be to maintain UC&#8217;s excellence while ensuring a solid financial foundation for UC&#8217;s future.<br/>
 <br/>
 This core principle of protecting both UC&#8217;s excellence and its long-term financial health was the basis for last year&#8217;s multi-year funding agreement with the State, and is the primary driver of my retirement proposal.<br/>
 <br/>
 The budget agreement with the Governor and the Legislature last year marked a significant milestone in support of this goal by creating an era of increased State funding and financial stability for the University. Importantly, the agreement reflects the State government&#8217;s recognition of the need to invest in UC.<br/>
 <br/>
 Under this agreement, UC is receiving nearly $1 billion in new annual revenue and one-time funding over the next several years, which will help ensure the University&#8217;s long-term financial stability and provides critical funding for many UC priorities.<br/>
 <br/>
 Among other things, this funding allows us to budget for regular pay increases for faculty and staff over the next several years, and make merit-based pay a more regular component of our systemwide salary programs.<br/>
 <br/>
 The $1 billion includes $436 million in one-time funds to help pay down our unfunded pension liability, which is key to ensuring the long-term fiscal solvency of the UC pension plan.<br/>
 <br/>
 To help secure the financial stability of UC and as part of the agreement, I am proposing to The Regents that they approve implementation of a new set of retirement benefits for future UC employees hired on or after July 1, 2016, that limits the pensionable salary for future UC employees, mirroring the cap on pensionable pay for state employees under the 2013 California Public Employees&#8217; Pension Reform Act (the &#8220;PEPRA cap&#8221;).<br/>
 <br/>
 Following completion of the budget agreement, which was approved by The Regents, I convened a systemwide task force to suggest options for the new retirement benefits for future employees, consistent with the PEPRA cap.<br/>
 <br/>
 Task force members included faculty, staff, and representatives from the Academic Senate, the Staff Advisors to The Regents, the Council of UC Staff Assemblies, UC labor unions, and UC administrators.<br/>
 <br/>
 The task force submitted its recommendations to me in December, and during January and February, I invited members of the entire UC community to share with me their thoughts about those recommendations.<br/>
 <br/>
 I want to thank the task force members for their good and thoughtful work, and also the hundreds of faculty and staff who shared their comments, concerns, and ideas with me.<br/>
 <br/>
 Many of you expressed concern that a new set of retirement benefits could harm the University&#8217;s ability to attract and retain top-tier faculty. Improving overall employee compensation and the stability of the UC pension plan were also common concerns. Another concern many of you raised was the need for more retirement education and services to help employees prepare successfully for retirement.<br/>
 <br/>
 For those of you who shared your views with me, I want you to know I paid close attention. My proposal addresses not only these concerns, but other priorities as well.<br/>
 <br/>
 Building upon the work of task force, and after much discussion with numerous stakeholders and careful consideration of the input I received from faculty and staff, I will be bringing a package proposal to The Regents that will allow us to:<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8211; ensure UC&#8217;s long-term financial stability, including keeping the UC pension plan strong and continuing to pay down our unfunded pension liability;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8211; within the fiscal constraints we face, maintain the caliber of UC personnel and the University&#8217;s excellence by offering attractive overall compensation, including retirement benefits, for new faculty and staff;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8211; focus on overall employee compensation by (1) allowing UC to budget for regular pay increases for faculty and staff, and (2) making merit-based pay a regular component of systemwide salary programs to reward employees based on their contributions to the University;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8211; preserve UC&#8217;s quality, which requires recruiting and retaining quality personnel, especially faculty, by devoting resources to help campuses attract and retain faculty and key staff, and improve the student experience; and<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8211; offer enhanced retirement education and counseling services to all UC employees, as part of the University&#8217;s commitment to help employees be &#8220;retirement ready.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Regarding the new retirement program specifically, I am proposing that future employees hired on or after July 1, 2016, be offered a choice between two options:<br/>
 <br/>
 Option 1 &#8211; Pension + 401(k)-style supplemental benefit: The current UC pension benefit capped at the PEPRA salary limit (currently $117,020) plus a supplemental 401(k)-style benefit for eligible employee pay up to the Internal Revenue Service limit (currently $265,000).<br/>
 <br/>
 Option 2 &#8211; New 401(k)-style benefit: A new stand-alone 401(k)-style plan with benefits-eligible employee pay up to the Internal Revenue Service limit (currently $265,000).<br/>
 <br/>
 Since we compete in a global market for faculty, often against elite private institutions that can typically pay more than UC, maintaining a pension benefit along with a 401(k)-style supplement is important to attracting and retaining the caliber of personnel we need to maintain UC&#8217;s excellence.<br/>
 <br/>
 At the same time, our workforce is highly diverse and people have different retirement needs and goals. A new stand-alone 401(k)-style retirement benefit allows us to offer an attractive retirement benefit to employees who work at UC for only a few years and value a portable retirement benefit they can take with them, and/or who prefer to personally manage their retirement savings.<br/>
 <br/>
 You can find a chart that further summarizes the features of the two options online <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/2016-retirement-benefits/rotf-fact-sheet.pdf">here.</a><br/>
 <br/>
 In short, I believe this proposal supports the University&#8217;s ongoing excellence and will significantly bolster the long-term financial stability of UC and its retirement program, while providing critical funding for other University priorities.<br/>
 <br/>
 I again want to thank the task force members, and the many faculty and staff who shared their views with me. The input I received from the task force and the University community was invaluable in formulating this proposal.<br/>
 <br/>
 Yours very truly, <br/>

The protein is normally active in fetal tissue and switched off in adults, but it is reactivated in some cancer cells. This expression pattern makes it an attractive target for cancer-fighting drugs, because blocking its activity is unlikely to cause serious side effects.</p>
<p>The new study, published March 14 in the <em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em>, focused on a particularly aggressive form of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most prevalent type of leukemia in children and young adults. A team led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA found an overabundance of the RNA binding protein known as IGF2BP3 in the cancer cells of this subset of B-ALL patients.</p>
<p>"This protein, IFG2BP3, has been correlated with many types of malignancies and with the worst prognoses," said coauthor Jeremy Sanford, associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz. "What is exciting about this study is that it goes beyond correlation and shows causation, because we demonstrated for the first time that aberrant expression of this protein is sufficient to induce pathology."</p>
<p><strong>Oncogenes</strong></p>
<p>The researchers identified genes that are directly regulated by this RNA binding protein, and many of them turn out to be oncogenes that have already been implicated in cancer. In particular, the protein enhances the expression of a well-characterized oncogene called MYC, which in turn regulates a large number of genes involved in cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Compared to other proteins involved in regulating gene activity, RNA binding proteins have not been well studied. When a gene is turned on or "expressed," an RNA copy is made of the gene's DNA sequence, and the genetic code carried by this "messenger RNA" is then translated into a protein that carries out some cellular function. Many factors are involved in controlling which genes get transcribed into messenger RNA and when, but RNA binding proteins interact with the messenger RNA itself to regulate gene expression after transcription has occurred. Scientists are only beginning to unravel the complexity of this post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>In the case of IGF2BP3 and B-cell leukemia, the overall effect of the RNA binding protein is to promote the proliferation of B cells by shifting the expression of a large number of genes, Sanford said.</p>
<p><strong>Stem cells</strong></p>
<p>Leukemia starts in the "hematopoietic" stem cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all the different kinds of mature blood cells. A variety of genetic alterations can cause abnormal white blood cells to proliferate and crowd out the normal blood cells. Sanford's collaborator at UCLA, Dinesh Rao, was studying B-ALL cases involving chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, which accounts for about 5 percent of B-ALL cases and is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of early relapse after treatment.</p>
<p>After Rao's lab identified IGF2BP3 as one of the top dysregulated genes in these cases, they began working with Sanford's lab to figure out which genes were being directly regulated by IGF2BP3. Sanford and Rao have been friends since they were undergraduates, and Rao knew that Sanford's lab was among the few using a technique that can capture RNA molecules bound to a particular protein. Called individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), the technique enabled Sanford's lab to identify IGF2BP3 binding sites in several hundred RNA transcripts in two B-ALL cell lines. They also showed that IGF2BP3 enhanced the expression of MYC and other oncogenes in hematopoietic stem cells.</p>
<p>Studying its effects in mice, the researchers found that overexpression of IGF2BP3 in the bone marrow leads to proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and B cell progenitors, reproducing some features of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.</p>
<p>"Understanding its mechanism of action is important for thinking about therapeutics that might interfere with the action of this protein in disease," Sanford said. "One possibility is an RNA-based therapeutic that could sequester the protein and keep it from binding to RNA transcripts. That would be a way to influence the expression of many genes involved in the proliferation of cancer cells."</p>
<p>The lead authors of the study are Jayanth Palanichamy and Tiffany Tran at UCLA and Jonathan Howard at UC Santa Cruz. Other coauthors, in addition to Sanford and Rao, include Jorge Contreras, Thilini Fernando, and Weihong Yan at UCLA; Timothy Sterne-Weiler and Sol Katzman at UC Santa Cruz; Masoud Toloue at Bioo Scientific Corporation; and Giuseppe Basso and Martina Pigazzi at the University of Padova, Italy.

Researchers studying how breast cells respond to this tissue stiffening have identified molecular signals that enable cells to protect themselves from its deleterious effects in ways that may delay the progression of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The study, published March 14 in the <em>Journal of Cell Biology</em>, identifies a signaling pathway involving a protein called ROBO1 that, when activated in tumor cells, is associated with increased long-term survival of breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>"We identified a circuit that regulates the response of the cell to increasing stiffness in the extracellular matrix and allows cells to push back against external forces," said corresponding author Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz. "In epidemiological studies of women with breast cancer, we found that if this pathway is activated in their tumor cells, it's a protective mechanism and is associated with better prognosis."</p>
<p><strong>Signaling proteins</strong></p>
<p>The ROBO family of signaling proteins--best known for their role in guiding the growth of developing neurons--regulates the cytoskeleton, the internal structures that help cells maintain their shape and carry out essential functions like movement and cell division. The ROBO proteins are receptors in the cell membrane that seem to help cells sense and respond to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>Hinck's team examined the ROBO signaling pathway in breast epithelial cells and found that one family member, ROBO1, enhances cellular contractility and stimulates assembly of cell-matrix adhesions. Stiffer environments caused breast cells to down-regulate a microRNA (miR-203) that normally suppresses the Robo1 gene, thereby elevating ROBO1 protein levels. This, in turn, enhanced cellular contractility and adhesion, allowing cells to retain their shape and position within stiff extracellular matrices.</p>
<p>Breast cancer cells lacking ROBO1 were more invasive, suggesting that the up-regulation of ROBO1 in stiff environments may prevent cells from metastasizing to other tissues. Moreover, previous work by Hinck's lab has shown that ROBO1 can suppress cell proliferation, suggesting that this pathway could delay tumor progression.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Clinical significance</strong></p>
<p>To assess the clinical significance of this pathway, the researchers analyzed breast tumor data from <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> using the <a href="https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser</a>. They found that breast cancer patients whose tumors displayed low miR-203/high Robo1 expression had better long-term survival rates.</p>
<p>Hinck and her colleagues, including collaborators at UCSF and the University of Wisconsin, now want to confirm that ROBO1 can counteract the pro-tumorigenic effects of tissue stiffening in both mice and humans.</p>

<hr/>
<p>As a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, David Robles felt frustrated.</p>
<p>He was learning about environmental problems in his classes but couldn&#8217;t see how he could help solve them. Then, against the odds, he was one of only two people selected among 200 applicants for a work-study job on the campus farm. Suddenly, a career path took shape.</p>
<p>&#8221;It totally changed the way I saw environmentalism,&#8221; Robles said. &#8220;I could work for hours and see how it&#8217;s contributing to the sustainability cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a senior, Robles has spent three years as an assistant farm and garden manager in preparation for what he hopes will be a career in social justice centered around agriculture. But before he graduates, he is undertaking a fitting final project: Coordinating, producing and writing lyrics for a rap music video that highlights experiential learning in food and agriculture as part of his UC Global Food Initiative Student Fellowship.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to find yourself amid all the academic chaos,&#8221; Robles said. &#8220;Experiential learning helps students realize where they can really apply themselves to see where they can make a tangible difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>From well-established student farms at UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis to a crop of new gardens, courses and programs popping up across the University of California system, UC is offering experiential learning opportunities to students at all levels. This hands-on learning offers invaluable real-world experience to students, diversifying their skills, providing leadership development and helping prepare them for successful careers.</p>
<p>Overall, UC offers more than 200 courses and 150 programs related to experiential learning in food and sustainable agriculture systems. For example, farms and gardens provide diverse opportunities for students to participate in activities related to food, nutrition, research, education and outreach, according to a new Global Food Initiative report that highlights best practices, lessons learned and case studies of experiential learning across the UC system.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, new undergraduate internships give students from across the campus a chance to work alongside participants in the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, the six-month, full-time residential training program in organic farming and gardening offered by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The apprenticeship has had fantastic success for more than 40 years,&#8221; producing more than 1,400 graduates, said Damian Parr, the center&#8217;s education coordinator and a former apprentice. &#8220;We&#8217;re now moving toward more integration with upper division and senior undergraduate internships as we build the capacity at the introductory level.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all, about 200 undergraduates a year participate in the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems&#8217; fieldwork-intensive classes and internship programming. In addition, some 3,600 pre-K-12 students visit the UC Santa Cruz Farm annually for environmental education through Life Lab. UC Santa Cruz also partners with FoodWhat, a youth empowerment and food justice organization that works with low-income high school students in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>In July, a <a href="http://sustainableaged.org/conferences/2016-santa-cruz-ca/">three-day national conference will be held at UC Santa Cruz</a> in collaboration with the Sustainable Agriculture Education Association. The conference will be a chance to discuss sustainable agriculture education and see examples of experiential learning in action.</p>
<p>Parr hopes to debut Robles&#8217; video at the conference.</p>
<p>Robles noted that his video is about experiential learning and is a form of experiential learning &#8211; bringing together diverse groups from film students to music students to sustainability students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to inspire more students to join those organizations and find themselves like how I found myself on the farm,&#8221; Robles said.</p>

<p>&#8220;New Orleans rhythm and blues, like any music, has the capacity to generate community,&#8221; Urban writes in <em>New Orleans Rhythm and Blues After Katrina: Music, Magic and Myth</em> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016).</p>
<p>Through 56 open-ended interviews with music journalists, producers, promoters and, of course, some of New Orleans most prominent musicians (including Davis Rogan, the inspiration behind the HBO&#8217;s "Treme" character, Davis McAlary), Urban explores the distinctive subculture of the New Orleans music community and finds an ethos that subordinates individual achievement to group effort, both musically and socially.</p>
<p><strong>From Russia with love for Louisiana</strong></p>
<p>For more than 40 years, Urban&#8217;s research focused on Russian politics, concentrating on the fall of the communist regime and the state and social issues that followed. He also studied the emergence of a rhythm and blues culture in Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have long been enchanted by New Orleans. It was a (big) easy decision,&#8221; Urban said about his switch from Russia to Louisiana.</p>
<p>Urban discovered that Katrina left both scars and opportunity, with rhythm and blues tradition fundamentally altered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The soil in which that tradition has been rooted&#8211;namely, in the working class and poor African-American neighborhoods with their corner juke joints, backyard get-togethers and second-line street parades&#8211;has been largely scattered to the winds,&#8221; Urban writes.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina displaced more than 100,000 residents, mostly from poor and working-class neighborhoods where rhythm and blues took root. &#8220;The bulk of that population has been deported and effectively denied the right of return. Many of its neighborhoods have been demolished; its institutions supporting music&#8211;social and pleasure clubs leading street parades, the corner juke&#8211;have been decimated,&#8221; Urban says.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s musical tradition is a fundamental part of the New Orleans narrative and community, Urban argues. The musical heritage, distinctive legacy, and place in revolutionizing popular music hold a special place in the city&#8217;s cultural landscape. He represents this narrative as a myth that is embedded in the cultural community.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Orleans has come to represent a sacred site in which mythic time prevails, informing the everyday present with a sense of an epic past,&#8221; Urban argues.</p>
<p><strong>Commercialization and regulation</strong></p>
<p>Urban describes how the recovery and redevelopment of New Orleans inevitably altered the local music scene. While new investment from across the country helped recovery efforts, the new wave of gentrification changed the local economy.</p>
<p>Post-Katrina, many musicians have experienced a shift in how their music has been played and paid. Now, making money has become a more pressing necessity for musicians, and commercial relations have begun to supplant the force of cultural traditions as regulators of conduct.</p>
<p>For example, due to local government&#8217;s expanded reach into the community, the city is no longer home to juke joints and corner bars where R&amp;B is played. Yesterday&#8217;s small proprietors who are now required to obtain liquor licenses and insurance have been largely driven out of the market, says Urban.</p>
<p><strong>More music, more community</strong></p>
<p>Low pay forces musicians to expand their mastery of styles, prompting them to play in multiple bands and appear on as many sub lists as they can. This new arrangement frequently brings together individuals previously unknown to one another that over time, &#8220;everyone plays with everyone&#8221; one of Urban&#8217;s sources reports, forging and reinforcing the bonds of community on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As Urban shows, New Orleans rhythm and blues remains a vital cultural idiom, with musicians retelling and reshaping the city&#8217;s musical legacy. <em>New Orleans Rhythm and Blues After Katrina: Music, Magic and Myth</em> is testimony to the distinct space and place it holds in American life.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="809d9a0780727017266c9f814909e550"><name>kuumbwa-alumni-weekend-jazz-event</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Humanities, Kuumbwa partner to jazz up Alumni Weekend </title><summary>This special event will feature a conversation on the history of jazz by experts in the field, followed by the vocal styling of jazz singer Kim Nalley.</summary><start-date>1458111600000</start-date><display-name>Kuumbwa event on alumni weekend</display-name><path>/2016/03/kuumbwa-alumni-weekend-jazz-event</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/kuumbwa-alumni-weekend-jazz-event</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1458151725530</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1458151998618</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/kim nalley photo350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/kim nalley photo350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kim nalley photo350.jpg</name><display-name>kim nalley photo350.jpg</display-name><file-size>41766</file-size><width>350</width><height>243</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/KimNalleythumbnail80</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/KimNalleythumbnail80</link><site>news</site><name>KimNalleythumbnail80</name><display-name>KimNalleythumbnail80</display-name><file-size>12869</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jazz singer Kim Nalley will take part in an event at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center that is part of both UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend festivities and International Jazz Day.

<p>The evening kicks off at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 30, at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz. Admission is $25.</p>
<p>The special event will feature a conversation on the history of jazz by experts in the field, followed by the vocal styling of jazz singer <a href="http://www.kimnalley.com">Kim Nalley</a>, a Bay Area favorite and up-and-coming star who has performed all over the world, and is also a jazz scholar in her own right.</p>
<p><a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/index.html">Alumni Weekend</a> takes place April 28&#8211;May 1, 2016. <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html">Events</a> are centered for the most part on campus, but some off-campus events, including this one, are likely to lure Slugs away from their alma mater, at least for a few hours.</p>
<p>Nalley is on faculty at the California Jazz Conservatory. She is also Ph.D. candidate in UC Berkeley's history department, with plans to write her dissertation about the globalization of jazz and black cultural politics.</p>
<p>Before the performance, Nalley, along with UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean Tyler Stovall, and UC Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter, will give a thought-provoking presentation about global jazz history as it relates to race, class and culture.</p>
<p>The Kuumbwa event is also part of <a href="http://jazzday.com">International Jazz Day,</a> a joyous, worldwide celebration of music that falls on the same date. In honor of this special day, Santa Cruz will be a jazz hotspot, with several venues hosting evenings of music throughout the city.</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) instituted this international celebration in 2011 to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division and the Institute for Humanities Research are co-sponsoring the Kuumbwa event.</p>
<p>On the same busy weekend, UC Santa Cruz alumni may take part in a multitude of Alumni Weekend events, such as a tour of the UC Santa Cruz Farm, a discussion about the way people learn, a tour of the beloved and soon-to-be refurbished Quarry Amphitheater, a highly anticipated farm-to-table lunch, and a discussion entitled &#8220;How To Clone A Mammoth&#8221; with Beth Shapiro from the UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Lab.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="816d136580727017266c9f81533a8b0b"><name>upcoming-power-outages</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planned power outages – Monday, March 21, 2016 2 –11 p.m.</title><summary>On Monday, March 21, 2016, testing to the main campus electrical system will impact power to the entire upper campus with the potential for five to eight power outages of 30-50 minutes each between 2 and 11 p.m.</summary><start-date>1458111600000</start-date><display-name>Planned power outages – March 21, 2016 2 –11 p.m.</display-name><path>/2016/03/upcoming-power-outages</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/upcoming-power-outages</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1458165322554</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1458577739621</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>On Monday, March 21, 2016, testing to the main campus electrical system will impact power to the entire upper campus with the potential for five to eight power outages of 30-50 minutes each between 2 and 11 p.m.<br/>
 <br/>
 Previous notice was provided to building coordinators.&#160; The testing is related to the new Fackler Cogeneration Plant and system controls.&#160; The outages will NOT affect lower campus buildings such as Women's Center, Carriage House, Barn G, H Barn, Family Student Housing, Faculty Housing, Cook House, ERC, childcare facilities, or off-campus buildings. <br/>
 <br/>
 Beginning at approximately 2 p.m. (not earlier) there will be a series of five to eight power interruptions of 30-50 minutes in duration.&#160; It is advised that units work under the assumption that the electrical power in the affected areas will be unavailable after 2 p.m. and plan their workday accordingly.<br/>
 <br/>
 The purpose of this notice is to assist the community with preparedness.&#160; Managers and supervisors have the responsibility for providing direction to employees, students, and volunteers, including operational decision-making. In the event of a power outage, they are responsible for employee safety and for the implementation of all related business continuity actions. Managers are asked to prepare and address any questions that individuals under their supervision may have. Please read this detailed information closely and work to ensure readiness.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Human resource information<br/>
<br/>
</strong> For employees who normally work on campus during this time, the workplace may be affected by power outages. To ensure employee safety and avoid a loss of pay due to the planned outage, managers and supervisors should consider the following:<br/>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A change in employee schedule</span> &#8211; an employee&#8217;s work schedule may be adjusted to work around the power outage period;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A change in employee work location</span> &#8211; an employee may be directed to work at an unaffected on-campus site or off-campus university-managed site, or to telecommute;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scheduling an off-site training</span> &#8211; managers may select to schedule a department training at an off-campus site;&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vacation or compensatory time off (CTO)</span> &#8211; Managers may approve advance requests for vacation or CTO in accordance with policy and labor agreements.&#160; Managers may not, however, curtail operations and require employees to use vacation or CTO;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Administrative leave with pay</span> &#8211; Although not expected, if specific campus operations are officially determined to be inaccessible, the campus provost/executive vice chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who are expected to work but are unable.&#160;&#160; Managers will be notified should administrative leave with pay be approved.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Facilities information</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency power</span> &#8211; The standard emergency power supply for the campus, inclusive of emergency lighting will be operable during the scheduled outage.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lighting</span> &#8211; Managers should ensure that there is adequate lighting to support a safe workplace.&#160; If a workplace does not have enough light to work, please reassign the employee workspace.&#160; It&#8217;s also best to ensure that employees and offices have flashlights on hand.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elevators and accessibility</span> &#8211; <strong>Building coordinators, divisional facilities staff, building managers, or supervisors will need to post signage at all floors indicating they should not be used during the testing period, 2-11 p.m.&#160;</strong> Please prepare signage in advance and assign the posting to a specific person.&#160; Use of the elevators during this time could result in entrapment within the elevators requiring a fire department response.&#160; Anyone needing an elevator to access their place of work or general campus activity should consult with their supervisor for alternative accessibility options and work locations for the time of the outage.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Housing and residential areas</span> &#8211; Although it is spring break, there will be students living throughout all residential areas.&#160; UCSC Dining operations will be closed.&#160; A separate, detailed message will be issued to residential students.</li>
</ol>

<strong>ITS information<br/>
<br/>
</strong> All campus services hosted in the Data Center will remain operational. Campus websites, digital and analog telephones, 911, Blue Light phones (apart from the cellular locations), and the two-way radio systems will also be operational. Please note the following that may experience service interruptions:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Network service in many campus buildings will be disrupted.</li>
<li>CruzNet and eduroam wireless access may experience intermittent outages.</li>
<li>Campus cellular phone service will have limited coverage.</li>
<li>Blue Light emergency phones that rely on cellular connectivity may be impacted.</li>
<li>Buildings with VoIP telephones that have no backup generator will lose power if the battery run time expires.</li>
<li>Research clusters hosted in the Data Center will be shut down.</li>
<li>MyUCSC &#8211; although applications housed in the campus Data Center will remain fully functional during the outage, faculty and staff working on campus should be prepared for building network outages which could disrupt connections to campus systems. Faculty especially should take precautions if entering grades via MyUCSC from their office or any campus building during the outage period, as a sudden network outage could result in lost work. Precautions include saving often, working from a non-campus location, or refraining from entering grades (or performing other critical systems-related work) during the outage window.</li>

<p>The endowed chair was established in 2015 through a gift from UCSC alumnus Sage Weil, who also made additional gifts totaling $2 million to support research in open source software. Brandt said he will use the funds from the chair to support the <a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu">Center for Research in Open Source Software</a> (CROSS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Sage Weil's support helped us start a big research effort in open-source software here at UC Santa Cruz, and the endowed chair makes a permanent statement about the value of this work," Brandt said.</p>
<p>Brandt is a founding faculty member of CROSS, which was created to bridge the gap between student research and open-source software projects. Weil developed his Ph.D. thesis project into a highly successful open-source software product, the data storage system <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>.</p>
<p>"People often do great research projects as graduate students, but they rarely make the effort to turn them into something other people can use. One of the things that made Ceph so successful is that Sage was able to keep working on it in the context of his company after he graduated, and he wanted to make that same opportunity available to others," Brandt said.</p>
<p>CROSS funds open source research projects, builds collaborations with industry partners, and selects promising projects for further development in the CROSS incubator. Three companies--Toshiba, SK Hynix Memory Solutions, and Micron--have joined CROSS as founding industry members, providing additional funding and serving on the center's industry advisory board.</p>
<p>Director Carlos Maltzahn, professor of computer science at UC Santa Cruz, said the center is currently funding four research projects, and CROSS faculty designed an undergraduate course in open-source programming that was taught for the first time winter quarter. He said the additional funding provided through the endowed chair will help expand the scope of the projects supported by CROSS.</p>
<p>"Initially, we've been focused on storage systems, but we would like to support open-source projects in many more research areas," Maltzahn said. "One of our new projects, for example, is a collaboration with the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genomics Institute</a> on smart storage devices in genomics. It's still storage-related, but by branching out into genomics we're starting to see the diversity we want to achieve."</p>
<p>Brandt's own research is in the area of computer systems, focusing on storage systems, real-time systems, and performance management. Brandt and Maltzahn supervised Weil's thesis research. Weil was already a successful entrepreneur when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 2004 to study data storage systems. After earning his Ph.D. in computer science in 2007, Weil continued to work on Ceph with a small team at his web hosting company, DreamHost, then founded the spin-off Inktank to further develop the platform. Inktank was acquired by open-source software provider Red Hat in 2014.</p>
<p>The Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software is one of eight endowed chairs established at UC Santa Cruz in 2015 through gifts from campus supporters and matching funds from the UC Presidential Endowment Fund. Increasing support for the Baskin School of Engineering and endowed chairs are goals of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which to date has raised more than $223 million in resources for the campus.</p>

<p>Features observed on the dwarf planet's surface include glaciers of frozen nitrogen feeding into a vast basin, huge mountains of ice, strange pits and ridges, tectonic fractures, and possible ice volcanoes.</p>
<p>"Pluto is much more geologically active than anybody predicted," said Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the New Horizons Science Team. "It's like Earth in that the surface is getting reshaped by erosion and other processes. It's harder to tell what's going on in the deep interior, but certainly its surface is extremely active."</p>
<p>Nimmo is a coauthor of two papers on Pluto and its moons published March 18 in <em>Science</em>. Observations of Pluto and its largest moon Charon are presented in a paper led by first author Jeffrey Moore of NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Subsurface ocean</strong></p>
<p>Nimmo said he is especially interested in the possibility that Pluto might have an ocean beneath its frozen surface. "That's one of the most important questions we'd like to answer," he said.</p>
<p>The first clue suggesting a subsurface ocean is Pluto's shape. Most fast-spinning bodies, including the Earth, have a bulge around the equator due to rotational forces. The bulge tends to form early, when a planet or moon is still relatively warm and pliable. In some cases, like the Earth's Moon, this early large bulge became frozen in place. But Pluto is almost perfectly spherical.</p>
<p>"We looked for a bulge, and we don't see one, so Pluto has probably remained relatively warm and relatively weak," Nimmo said. "If it has an ocean inside, that's one way to explain why it can't hold on to a big bulge."</p>
<p>Pluto also has a lot of fractures on its frozen surface that appear young and may indicate recent expansion. Because water expands as it freezes, a subsurface ocean in the process of refreezing as the planet cools would cause surface extension and fractures in the ice shell. "What happens is heat builds up in the interior due to radioactive decay in the rocks, which melts the overlying ice to create a subsurface ocean. Over time, the amount of heat decreases, and eventually the ocean begins to refreeze," Nimmo explained. "We would really like to know if that's the case on Pluto, and there are at least hints of it now."</p>
<p><strong>Sputnik Planum</strong></p>
<p>One of the dominant features in the New Horizons images of Pluto is a large oval basin, about 1,000 kilometers across, containing a thick layer of volatile ices--mostly frozen nitrogen, as well as carbon dioxide and methane. At a few locations along the edge of the basin (called Sputnik Planum), there are glaciers flowing out of mountainous terrain down into the basin. "You can actually see flow lines and other features you'd see if you looked at a glacier on Earth from the air," Nimmo said.</p>
<p>Unlike on Earth, however, the mountains are made of water ice and the glaciers are frozen nitrogen. The nitrogen and other volatile ices may be cycling between Sputnik Planum and the surrounding uplands. Pits in the surface of the plain in some areas may have formed through sublimation of nitrogen ice. "They're peculiar looking features, and we don't really know what's causing them, but it may be energy from the sun causing the nitrogen to sublime away, and once a pit forms it focuses the sunlight and gets larger," Nimmo said.</p>
<p>In other parts of the basin, the surface is broken into a pattern of polygonal cells that suggest heat-driven circulation patterns in the depths of the basin. "The nitrogen is solid, but it's soft enough to flow, and it really looks as if it's being stirred by convection driven by heat coming out from the interior," Nimmo said.</p>
<p>South of Sputnik Planum, two large mounds with central depressions are suggestive of cryovolcanism, or ice volcanoes. Although he is skeptical, Nimmo said this would be a big deal if it were true. The features are moderately young, so if they are ice volcanoes it suggests the interior of Pluto, not just its surface, must have been active relatively recently. "This is likely to be an issue which is much-debated over the next few years," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/feature/top-new-horizons-findings-reported-in-science</url><title>Top New Horizons Findings Reported in Science</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/feature/science-papers-reveal-new-aspects-of-pluto-and-its-moons</url><title>NASA Press Release</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81d72bf880727017266c9f816d1283bd"><name>in-memoriam-mary-joan-rodriguez</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Mary Joan Rodriguez</title><summary>Mary Joan Rodriguez, who worked in the registrar’s office at Oakes College for 19 years, died Feb. 26.

McCarthy)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>By analyzing the composition of long-lived, deep-sea corals, UC Santa Cruz researchers have been able to track how ocean ecosystems responded to climate shifts over the past 1,000 years. Hawaiian gold corals, which can live to be over 4,000 years old, act as living records, or "paleoarchives," by recording in their growth rings the chemical signatures of past ocean conditions.</p>
<p>Kelton McMahon, an assistant researcher in the <a href="http://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a>, presented the team's findings in February at the 2016 Ocean Sciences Meeting in New Orleans. He is also first author of a paper on the findings <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6267/1530">published in <em>Science</em></a> in December.</p>
<p>McMahon used the ancient deep-sea corals to track climate-influenced changes in phytoplankton, the free-floating algae and other microorganisms that live in surface waters and shape the ocean's chemistry, composition, and health. The corals feed on dead phytoplankton and other organic matter that drifts down to the seafloor, incorporating into their skeletons the chemical fingerprints of life at the surface.</p>
<p>"These corals act as a sort of living sediment trap," said McMahon. "They lay down a protein skeleton in chronological rings, so it creates a record of the food they've eaten throughout their entire lives."</p>
<p>That record reflects which phytoplankton communities were most prevalent at different periods. Phytoplankton may be small, but they shape the ocean in big ways, McMahon said. Often referred to as the "grasslands of the sea," they account for the majority of the ocean's biomass and form the foundation of marine food webs. "They touch on all of the fundamental aspects of the structure and function of marine ecosystems," McMahon said.</p>
<p>The coral skeletons contain essential amino acids left largely intact from when they were in the cells of phytoplankton from hundreds of years ago. By analyzing the composition of these amino acids in different growth rings, the researchers could tell what types of phytoplankton were dominant at different times in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Phytoplankton regimes</strong></p>
<p>Three major phytoplankton regimes emerged from this analysis, each coinciding with well-known climatic shifts that took place over the past 1,000 years or so. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly, a warm period from 950 to 1250, the phytoplankton community in the North Pacific was dominated by cyanobacteria that thrived when the supply of nutrients was limited due to a stable layer of warm surface water that inhibited mixing with nutrient-rich subsurface waters.</p>
<p>The second major phytoplankton regime occurred during the Little Ice Age, from 1400 to 1850. During this period, surface waters cooled and mixed more with subsurface waters, increasing the availability of nitrates and other nutrients. As a result, the plankton community shifted from cyanobacteria to microscopic algae.</p>
<p>The third period, which began with the onset of the industrial age and continues today, is dominated by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which are able to use nitrogen absorbed from the atmosphere into surface waters. This shift coincides with the increasing sea surface temperatures and changing climate driven by the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil fuel use and other human activities. Coauthor Matthew McCarthy said this latest resurgence of cyanobacteria is unlike any other.</p>
<p>"The rate of change is completely unprecedented. There's nothing else in the record that shows things changing so fast," said McCarthy, a professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Traditionally, oceanographers look to records preserved in layers of sediment on the seafloor to reconstruct past environmental shifts. But they don't have good sediment records of the past 1,000 years in the North Pacific, because the sediment accumulates so slowly and the top layer has undergone too much mixing, McCarthy said.</p>
<p>In addition, it can be difficult to match sediment records to other historical climate data. "When you look into past archives to reconstruct things, you usually find a lot of variability," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Clear record</strong></p>
<p>The Hawaiian gold corals, however, produced a surprisingly clear record. "I was amazed," said McCarthy. "It was a massive 'aha,' lightning bolt moment that showed what we're doing actually works. You don't get those moments all that often. This is an amazing data set that Kelton generated."</p>
<p>McCarthy and McMahon share similar backgrounds, but they differ in their approach to research. McCarthy contributes a deep understanding of paleoceanography, tracing the ocean's shifting conditions through geochemistry, while McMahon uses his training in ecology to understand how changes in the oceans affect marine ecosystems and animal communities. Both said they couldn't have tackled this problem without uniting to take an interdisciplinary approach.</p>
<p>"This is a spectacular example of what you can do by crossing field boundaries and collaborating in novel ways. Taken in isolation, none of the disciplines we come from could have produced or interpreted this," McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The two have already teamed up with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute to launch the next stage of their research. They are using remotely operated underwater vehicles to collect bamboo coral, another long-lived deep-sea species, in Monterey Bay's deep underwater canyon. The researchers plan to apply the same techniques they used with Hawaiian gold coral to understand how El Ni&#241;o cycles have influenced California's dynamic coastal systems. Ultimately, they want to better predict how a changing climate will shape the region's multimillion-dollar fisheries.</p>

Conducted along California's rocky coastline, the study shows that the most vulnerable organisms are likely to be those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.</p>
<p>Ocean acidification is occurring as the oceans absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide concentrations are steadily rising due to emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Absorption of carbon dioxide changes seawater chemistry, pushing it toward the lower, acidic end of the pH scale, although it remains slightly alkaline. A small decrease in pH affects the chemical equilibrium of ocean water, reducing the availability of carbonate ions needed by a wide range of organisms to build and maintain structures of calcium carbonate, such as the shells of mussels and oysters.</p>
<p>Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, is a coauthor of the new study, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22984">published March 18 in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>. "There is a lot of concern about how ocean acidification is going to affect marine species in the future, but most of our understanding comes from laboratory studies where a single organism is exposed to acidified seawater under very controlled conditions for a short period of time," Kroeker explained. "In reality, every organism is embedded in a complex community that experiences dynamic environmental conditions that will gradually change over time."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Calcifying organisms</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, researchers closely monitored conditions in tide pools along California's rocky coast, which are isolated from the open ocean during low tides. During the daytime, photosynthesis&#8212;the mechanism by which plants use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar, giving off oxygen in the process&#8212;takes up carbon dioxide from the seawater and acts to reverse ocean acidification's effects. At night, however, photosynthesis stops, while the respiration of plants and animals takes up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. This adds carbon dioxide to the seawater and exacerbates the effects of ocean acidification, increasing the risk to calcifying organisms.</p>
<p>"Tide pools are home to lots of different species that regularly experience daily swings in chemistry," Kroeker said. "Tide pools can experience particularly corrosive seawater during nighttime low tides, when all of the animals are 'exhaling' carbon dioxide into the water that has been cut off from the ocean."</p>
<p>The research team, led by scientists at the Carnegie Institution of Science, used these natural nighttime spikes in corrosive conditions to examine how entire communities of marine species respond to natural acidification. Observing a variety of California's natural rocky tide pools near the Bodega Marine Laboratory, they found that the rate of shell and skeletal growth was not greatly affected by seawater chemistry in the daytime. However, during low tide at night, water in the tide pools became corrosive to calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. The study found evidence that the rate at which these shells and skeletons dissolved during these nighttime periods was greatly affected by seawater chemistry.</p>
<p>"Unless carbon dioxide emissions are rapidly curtailed, we expect ocean acidification to continue to lower the pH of seawater," said lead author Lester Kwiatkowski of the Carnegie Institution of Science. "This work highlights that even in today's temperate coastal oceans, calcifying species, such as mussels and coralline algae, can dissolve during the night due to the more acidic conditions caused by community respiration."</p>
<p>These results highlight the vulnerability of marine species in even the most dynamic conditions to the global process of ocean acidification, Kroeker said.</p>
<p>According to coauther Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution, "If what we see happening along California's coast today is indicative of what will continue in the coming decades, by the year 2050 there will likely be twice as much nighttime dissolution as there is today. Nobody really knows how our coastal ecosystems will respond to these corrosive waters, but it certainly won't be well."</p>
<p>The study was a collaborative effort by the Carnegie Institution for Science, UC Davis, and UC Santa Cruz. This work was funded by the Carnegie Institution for Science, UC Multi-campus Research Initiatives and Programs, and the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b95ba6b80727017266c9f810e8dfdf5"><name>island-biodiversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study shows biodiversity benefits of removing invasive mammals from islands </title><summary>A global study documents conservation gains from efforts to eradicate invasive species from island ecosystems.</summary><keywords>Donald Croll, Don Croll, Bernie Tershy, Island Conservation, invasive species, island biodiversity</keywords><start-date>1458586860000</start-date><display-name>Study shows biodiversity benefits of removing invasive mammals from islands </display-name><path>/2016/03/island-biodiversity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/island-biodiversity</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1458335740885</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1479248162924</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/nz-storm-petrel-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/nz-storm-petrel-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nz-storm-petrel-400.jpg</name><display-name>nz-storm-petrel-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>94388</file-size><width>400</width><height>348</height></image><image-alt>New Zealand storm petrel chick</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/white-tern-seychelles-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/white-tern-seychelles-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>white-tern-seychelles-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>white-tern-seychelles-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18426</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>white tern</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Once thought extinct, New Zealand storm-petrels were rediscovered breeding on Little Barrier Island (Hauturu-o-toi) following cat and rat eradication.

A new study shows that eradicating invasive mammals provides substantial benefits for island biodiversity. &#160;</p>
<p>The study, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/4033.abstract?sid=ad9199cc-1b07-4468-b964-88538747ee97">published March 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, examined efforts around the globe to eradicate invasive mammals, primarily on uninhabited or sparsely populated islands, as a way of protecting native species. The researchers found 596 populations of 236 native species on 181 islands benefitted from these eradications.</p>
<p>"Compared to the mainland, islands are home to a disproportionately higher amount of biodiversity, much of which is highly threatened with extinction," said coauthor Donald Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Humans have introduced non-native, invasive mammals (accidentally or intentionally) to ninety percent of the world's island archipelagos," he said. "These mammals have devastating consequences for ecosystems because island species evolved in isolation without these mammalian predators. They have little to no defense against invasive mammals."</p>
<p>First author Holly Jones worked with Croll as a UC Santa Cruz undergraduate in 2003 and 2004, studying the impacts of invasive rats on seabirds. Now an assistant professor of biology at Northern Illinois University, she led a 30-member team of scientists to conduct the study.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful tool</strong></p>
<p>"We've known that invasive mammal eradications are a powerful conservation tool, but this is the first time the benefits have been quantified at the global scale," Jones said. "21 billion [U.S.] dollars are spent globally each year on nature conservation. A small fraction of this goes to eradication of invasive species, yet this relatively simple, cost-effective conservation intervention is benefitting hundreds of native animals and endangered species. This is fantastic news in the race to prevent extinctions."</p>
<p>"These island restoration projects are a proverbial silver bullet for biodiversity conservation," added co-author Nick Holmes, director of science for Island Conservation, a non-profit organization with a mission to prevent extinctions by removing invasive species from islands. Croll and coauthor Bernie Tershy, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, cofounded Island Conservation in the 1990s.</p>
<p>"For any conservation intervention, it is rare to find a body of global evidence measuring the outcomes for native species. These results are a testament to the value of these types of projects and the practitioners advancing them around our world," Holmes said.</p>
<p>The research team conducted a large-scale literature and database review along with expert interviews to estimate the benefits to native species of removing invasive mammals found on islands. The researchers documented positive responses, including population increases, recolonization, and successful reintroductions. Four species that qualified for down-listing to a lower category of extinction risk on the IUCN Red List, in part due to invasive mammal eradication, were the island fox (California), Seychelles magpie robin (Seychelles), Cook's petrel (New Zealand), and black-vented shearwater (Mexico).</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Key threats</strong></p>
<p>Once introduced to islands, invasive mammals represent key threats to native species through predation, competition, and habitat loss. Rodents, wild goats, and feral cats are the primary invasive mammals on islands, but foxes, weasels, rabbits, and other introduced animals also cause problems.</p>
<p>Islands with invasive species pose a unique biodiversity conservation challenge and opportunity. Islands occupy less than 6 percent of the Earth's land area, yet are home to 15 percent of terrestrial species. Islands represent 61 percent of recorded extinctions, with invasive species implicated in the majority of those, and 37 percent of all critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List are found on islands.</p>
<p>"Invasive alien species are causing an extinction crisis on the world's islands, but our research shows that this is one problem we have the tools to tackle, and the results can be spectacularly successful," said co-author Stuart Butchart, head of science at BirdLife International, the world's largest partnership of nature conservation organizations.</p>
<p>Examples of success include the New Zealand storm petrel, thought extinct for over 150 years, was recently found breeding on Little Barrier Island after eradication of cats and rats. The Scripps' murrelet is no longer a candidate for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) following rat eradication on Anacapa Island. The California Channel Islands' endemic island fox has been proposed to be removed from endangered species list following intensive conservation efforts, including a feral pig eradication on Santa Cruz Island. Documented beneficiaries of invasive mammal eradications are likely underreported because of a lack of monitoring, the researchers added.</p>
<p>Biologists have long been aware of the damage that can be done by invasive species. In February 1894, in New Zealand, one of the Stephens Island lighthouse keepers' pregnant female house cats escaped, went feral, and the cat population rocketed. By March 1895, they were largely responsible for driving the Stephens Island wren to extinction. On Kiritimati Island in the Pacific Ocean, cats and rats wiped out the Christmas sandpiper in the late 1800s. Cats on Guadalupe Island, Mexico, drove the Guadalupe storm-petrel to extinction in the early 1900s. There are hundreds more stories like this.</p>
<p>In recent decades, eradication programs have gained traction even on more populated islands. More than 1,100 attempts at eradication of invasive mammal populations have occurred. "Many eradication techniques were first developed in New Zealand, so much so that it's been commonplace to 'call the Kiwis' if you want to eradicate mammals," Jones said. "Now, more and more conservation organizations worldwide are embracing this conservation intervention."</p>
<p>Jones hopes the study's results will help conservation practitioners see where they can make further strides to curb extinctions and protect native species. "While we can't bring back the species that have gone extinct, our analysis shows that removing invasive mammals can help us undo some of the damage we've caused," she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8be4020480727017266c9f8165471053"><name>carbon-emissions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Current rate of carbon emissions is unprecedented in past 66 million years</title><summary>New analysis shows that carbon emissions from human activities are moving the Earth's climate system into uncharted territory.</summary><keywords>James Zachos, PETM, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology</keywords><start-date>1458576000000</start-date><display-name>Current rate of carbon emissions is unprecedented in past 66 million years</display-name><path>/2016/03/carbon-emissions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/carbon-emissions</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1458340889051</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1458748263209</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/jim-zachos-320.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/jim-zachos-320.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-zachos-320.jpg</name><display-name>jim-zachos-320.jpg</display-name><file-size>49405</file-size><width>320</width><height>214</height></image><image-alt>jim zachos with sediment core</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19348</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>jim zachos with sediment core</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Jim Zachos holds a sediment core from the seafloor showing the red clay layer that marks the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a period of extreme global warming and ocean acidification around 56 million years ago.

<p>Evidence found in sediment cores from the seafloor shows that 56 million years ago, massive emissions of greenhouse gases, possibly triggered by volcanism, caused a global warming of at least 5 degrees Celsius. Climate scientists have considered this episode, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), the closest analogue to current climate change. But the actual magnitude and rate of carbon emissions during the PETM have been difficult to determine.</p>
<p>"The challenge we've faced is constraining the rate of the carbon emission and warming, &#160;which is limited by the fidelity of the sediment records," said coauthor James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>New approach</strong></p>
<p>For the new study, Zachos, first author Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and coauthor Andy Ridgwell of the University of Bristol, U.K., developed a new approach that enables them to extract rates of change from a sediment record. Carbon release and climate change are recorded by different chemical signatures in the sediments, and the lag between the carbon release and the climate response reflects the rate of change.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the timing of the onset of climate change in the PETM with the timing of carbon emissions as recorded by marine sediments, and found that they occurred at essentially the same time. Using a climate and carbon cycle model, they showed that such a near-concurrent change suggests the PETM carbon emissions occurred over a period of at least 4,000 years.</p>
<p>"With a fast rate of forcing, there's a thermal lag in warming the oceans, in particular, because they are cold and large," Zachos explained. "If there's no observable lag, the rate of change could not have been any faster than a few thousand years."</p>
<p>The rate of carbon release during the PETM was found to be much smaller than the current input of carbon to the atmosphere from human activities. Carbon release rates from human sources reached a record high in 2014 of about 37 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. The researchers estimated the maximum sustained carbon release rate during the PETM had to be less than 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, about one-tenth the current rate.</p>
<p>"Because our carbon release rate is unprecedented over such a long time period in Earth's history, it also means that we have effectively entered a 'no-analogue' state. This represents a big challenge for projecting future climate changes because we have no good comparison from the past," said Zeebe.</p>
<p>Whereas large climate transitions in the past may have been relatively smooth, there is no guarantee for the future. The climate system is non-linear, which means its response to a forcing (such as carbon dioxide emissions) is a complex process involving a whole suite of components.</p>
<p>The findings have serious implications for the ability of modern ecosystems to adapt to climate change. In a commentary accompanying the paper in <em>Nature Geoscience,</em> Peter Stassen wrote that during the PETM, "marine ecosystems may have had sufficient time to adapt to environmental changes through migration or evolution. It therefore remains possible that the current rates of change might exceed the adaptive capacity of modern marine ecosystems and their constituents."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1957.html</url><title>Past

 <br/>
 The series is presented as part of a course taught this spring quarter by history of art and visual culture professor T.J. Demos, who is also director of the new <a href="https://creativeecologies.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Center for Creative Ecologies</strong></em></a>. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;As climate change threats grow more severe, and in the absence of government leadership, artists and activists are inventing creative strategies of consciousness-raising, mass mobilization, and ecologically sustainable thinking and living,&#8221; Demos noted.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This class, joined by a diverse array of guest speakers--all leaders in the area of climate justice and cultural politics--will explore current imperatives for making a just transition to a post-carbon future.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Demos said that the goal of this year&#8217;s Arts Dean&#8217;s Lecture Series is to introduce both students, and the general public, to the present convergence of artists and activists now addressing climate change. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Cultural practitioners are doing so in diverse and exciting ways, insisting on making visual culture and artistic creativity relevant to environmental studies,&#8221; Demos explained. &#8220;In this regard, they are fulfilling a long-standing avant-garde promise: to integrate art and life.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;They are attempting to address new forms of living and thinking according to the imperatives of ecological sustainability and social, political and economic justice, and equally carrying forward crucial questions about what it means to be human, social, and political in this time of momentous environmental changes.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Some skeptics might say the arts really can&#8217;t have a significant role in dealing with climate change--that it&#8217;s really the realm of scientists. But Demos has a different take. He believes that cross-disciplinary conversations are essential in a rapidly changing world in order to share knowledge and build intellectual resilience. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;There are many advantages to be gained from posing humanities and artistic-related questions to scientists, including the ethical implications of research, how it revises our shared conceptions of what it means to be human, and how we might relate responsibly to the web of life beyond ourselves,&#8221; said Demos.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Developing our senses, learning to look with acute perception, and thinking creatively and critically--all falling within the domain of specialization within the arts--are not only necessary in dealing with climate change, they will be among the human capacities that will save us in a world of increasing precarity and instability.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The series kicks off on Wednesday, March 30, with a talk by David Solnit titled &#8220;Using Arts Organizing to Fight for Climate Justice and More.&#8221; &#160;<br/>

The undergraduate and graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz were both ranked in the top 25 in the company's lists for 2016 of the best undergraduate and graduate schools for students to study and launch a career in game design.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranked 11th on the Princeton Review's list of the "Top 25" graduate schools and 23rd on the list of the "Top 50" undergraduate programs. The full lists are posted at <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/game-design">Top Schools for Game Design 2016</a>. The web site also provides information on the Princeton Review's methodology for the rankings and profiles of the schools.</p>
<p>UCSC offers a broad range of programs in computer game design. The <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> established the first undergraduate major in computer game design in the UC system in 2006. The campus also has three graduate programs with an emphasis on games: the professional M.S. in games and playable media; the digital arts and new media M.F.A.; and the Ph.D. or M.S. in computer science with a games focus.</p>
<p>The Princeton Review based its rankings on a survey it conducted in 2015 of 150 institutions offering game design coursework or degrees in the United States, Canada, and some countries abroad.</p>

I want to take this opportunity to reinforce some important points and share with you additional measures I am instituting to address these issues.<br/>
 <br/>
 Let me be clear: Each and every one of you has the right to come to UC to learn and work in an environment free of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to be part of an institution that deals with any substantiated reports of sexual harassment or violence firmly, fairly, and promptly.<br/>
 <br/>
 Ensuring that UC is a safe environment is a top priority both for the University, and to me personally. In 2014, I formed the 29-member <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault</span>, which has spent the last two years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instituting systemwide</span> improvements to strengthen our processes and increase transparency and consistency across the system. These improvements have included mandatory education and training for students, administrators, faculty, and staff; confidential support for survivors; resources for people reporting sexual violence and those responding to allegations; and standardized procedures for investigating, adjudicating, and imposing sanctions in cases involving students.<br/>
 <br/>
 In cases involving faculty, I appointed a joint committee of the UC administration and the Academic Senate, with student representation, to review our current procedures and provide recommendations to me by April 4. Once that work is complete, we will then focus on reviewing our process for handling cases involving staff beginning in April.<br/>
 <br/>
 But recent developments have demonstrated that we must take immediate steps to further shore up our efforts.<br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, I established a new Systemwide Peer Review Committee that will review and approve all proposed sanctions for any senior University leader found to have violated our UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment. Senior leaders include, but are not limited to, Chancellors, Associate and Assistant Chancellors, Provosts and Vice Provosts, Deans, Coaches, and Athletic Directors.<br/>
 <br/>
 After consulting with the Chancellors, I have appointed the following individuals to serve on the Systemwide Peer Review Committee:<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Co-Chair Sheryl Vacca</strong>, UC Chief Compliance and Audit Officer and Chair of the President&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence (UC Office of the President)</li>
<li><strong>Co-Chair Allison Woodall</strong>, Deputy General Counsel (UC Office of the President)</li>
<li><strong>Ramona Agrela</strong>, Associate Chancellor, Chief Human Resources (UC Irvine)</li>
<li><strong>Brian Alldredge</strong>, Vice Provost of Academic Affairs, Professor of Clinical Pharmacy (UCSF)</li>
<li><strong>Ken Baerenklau</strong>, Associate Provost, Associate Professor of Environmental Economics and Policy (UC Riverside)</li>
<li><strong>Gregg Camfield</strong>, Vice Provost for the Faculty, Professor of Literature and Culture (UC Merced)</li>
<li><strong>Fiona Doyle</strong>, Dean of Graduate Division, Professor of Mineral Engineering (UC Berkeley)</li>
<li><strong>Julie Freischlag</strong>, Vice Chancellor of Human Health Sciences, Dean of School of Medicine (UC Davis)</li>
<li><strong>Margaret Klawunn</strong>, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs (UC Santa Barbara)</li>
<li><strong>Sarah Latham</strong>, Vice Chancellor of Business and Administrative Services (UC Santa Cruz)</li>
<li><strong>JoAnn Trejo</strong>, Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs in Health Sciences, Professor of Pharmacology (UC San Diego)</li>
<li><strong>Patricia Turner</strong>, Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education, Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education (UCLA)</li>
</ul>
In addition, I have directed the Chancellors to ensure that <em>all</em> senior leaders take the University&#8217;s mandatory sexual harassment training by March 25 to guarantee full understanding of UC&#8217;s policy and procedures.<br/>
 <br/>
 We must, and we will, do a better job of investigating all claims of sexual harassment or sexual violence thoroughly and fairly. And when claims are substantiated, we must hold people accountable and impose sanctions that appropriately reflect the seriousness of these cases.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>University of California Community</audience><admin>President Janet Napolitano</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f135b2880727017266c9f81b3a5be59"><name>alternative-spring-break</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Colleges Nine and Ten students enjoy an alternative spring break in Watsonville </title><summary>Instead of surf, sand, and frivolity, 25 students from Colleges Nine and Ten are taking an alternative spring break this week, and they’re staying close to home.</summary><start-date>1458662400000</start-date><display-name>Alternative Spring Break</display-name><path>/2016/03/alternative-spring-break</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/alternative-spring-break</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1458662759168</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459278062255</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/asb-3-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/asb-3-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>asb-3-500.jpg</name><display-name>asb-3-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>269001</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>students on alternative spring break</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/asb-2-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/asb-2-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>asb-2-80.jpg</name><display-name>asb-2-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>38478</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>students on alternative spring break</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Colleges Nine and Ten students, from left, Eunique James, Cynthia Rafael Jimenez, and Ramon Ayala work with pupils at Calabasas Elementary School in Watsonville this week during alternative spring break.

<p>Colleges Nine and Ten are the only UC Santa Cruz colleges to sponsor an alternative spring break. Students receive two credits. In past years, they have traveled to Mexico and New Orleans to work on rebuilding projects. The last two years they worked in Live Oak. This year, under the direction of Colleges Nine and Ten Provost Flora Lu and service-learning coordinator Abbey Asher, the students are spending the week in Watsonville, getting to know the town, its people, and issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;With service learning you&#8217;re not only serving your community, you&#8217;re serving yourself,&#8221; said Jenn Figueroa, a third-year College Ten student and sociology major from southern California. This is her third alternative spring break, and she&#8217;s serving as a facilitator. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to get a different perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s program got started two weeks ago with a weekend get-acquainted meeting on campus with Carlos Palacios, the former Watsonville city manager and current deputy Santa Cruz County administrative officer; Consuleo Alba of Veremos Productions and founder of the Watsonville Film Festival; &#160;Maria Elena de la Garza, executive director of the Community Action Board; &#160;and Ramiro Madrano, a counselor at the Pajaro Valley Unifiied School District.</p>
<p>Sunday, the students took a walking and driving tour to learn more about the geography, history, and politics of the south county town, ending up at the Pajaro Art Council Gallery to visit an exhibit on migration.</p>
<p>Monday, students volunteered at Calabasas Elementary School where Lu has been working all year as part of a community partnership she established three years ago. They just beat the rain and worked on improving an outdoor learning space for kindergartners and planted pumpkin seeds along a fence. Earlier, Lu&#8217;s students in a service-learning course on environmental justice renovated a vandalized greenhouse, repaired compost bins, installed an irrigation system, and built raised vegetable beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really empowers the connection between Watsonville and UCSC,&#8221; said Katherine Le, a first-year College Nine student from San Jose. &#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to be involved with the community, it&#8217;s easy to sit back and do nothing. I really encourage other students to get involved,&#8221; Le said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been enlightening, there are a lot of eye-opening issues going on in Watsonville,&#8221; said another first-year student, Sara Durghalli from College Ten.</p>
<p>Today, students are scheduled to work on a mural project with the Police Activities League.&#160; On Wednesday, a visit to the Second Harvest Food Bank is scheduled for the morning and a tech day for Watsonville residents with the Digital Nest is set for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Thursday calls for learning about the Center for Farm Worker Families and then hosting a flea market for farm worker families.&#160; For the past three months, the College Nine and Ten students, along with Life Long Learners, have been gathering clothing and household goods for the families.&#160;</p>
<p>The program concludes with a final project due in two weeks that consists of either an essay on what they&#8217;ve learned through the service-learning experience or an art project that represents their experience along with a short written reflection.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a9e8f84c80727017266c9f81d048a50d"><name>king-laurie-r</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The storyteller and the detective</title><summary>Alumna and best-selling author Laurie R.

King reflects on the craft of storytelling and on her legendary fictional character, Mary Russell</article-subhead><article-text><p>A few years ago, author Laurie R. King went to the walled Moroccan city of Fez, intending to have a lovely vacation with her daughter and son-in-law.</p>
<p>Instead, as she wandered the ancient city&#8217;s narrow and twisting streets, she began to think about one of writing&#8217;s popular plots: that of a character who suffers from amnesia.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t this maze of streets be the perfect setting for a person trying to sort out their past, she thought? Wasn&#8217;t it also perfect that Fez was in the midst of a civil war in 1924&#8212;the year that is the setting for many of her bestselling mystery novels featuring her intrepid character Mary Russell, the much younger wife and intellectual peer of the legendary Sherlock Holmes?</p>
<p>King, 63, laughs as she remembers the trip that inadvertently turned into the 2012 novel <em>Garment of Shadows,</em> which, a starred Booklist review noted, captured the feel of the old city &#8220;with sensuous clarity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a plot laid right out for me,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>For the award-winning King (Kresge &#8217;77, religious studies) no experience, no interest, no encounter is without the potential to spark the next of her 25 books, some 3 million of which have arrived in the hands of eager readers over the past years.</p>
<p>An interest in India, the birthplace of her late husband, UC Santa Cruz Emeritus Professor Noel King, set off the 2004 book <em>The Game,</em> while an independent study course on alchemy during her time at UC Santa Cruz was the genesis for her 1999 novel <em>A Darker Place.</em> Her senior thesis on the role of the fool in Western culture, meanwhile, showed up in three of her novels: <em>To Play the Fool</em> (1995), <em>God of the Hive</em> (2010), and <em>Dreaming Spies</em> (2015).</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m probably one of the few people who actually make a living on a religious studies degree, who didn&#8217;t go into the ministry,&#8221; she says with twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>King, who is a third-generation San Francisco native and earned an honorary doctorate and a master's in Old Testament theology from the Graduate Theological Union, began her writing life at the age of 35. She&#8217;d finished her graduate work, her young son had started preschool, and being a professor&#8217;s wife with summer travel precluded a regular job, so she turned to what she loved: fiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first started, I would write quite a bit of my books at the wheel of my car, waiting for the kids to get out of school or finish with soccer practice,&#8221; King says. &#8220;I had a giant clipboard, a legal pad, and a pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her first two novels featuring her now-legendary protagonist Mary Russell did not immediately sell. However, her third novel, <em>A Grave Talent,</em> which was set in San Francisco and centered on a lesbian detective named Kate Martinelli, not only earned her a publishing contract but also an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery Novel.</p>
<p>Sitting at an outside table at a coffee shop near her Santa Cruz home, King is open, personable, and quick with a laugh as she talks about her writing life, her family, and her time at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not fussy about where she writes, she says. A laptop and a chair will do. And, while her character, Mary Russell, might resemble her in appearance, &#8220;Russell is far more competent that I am. I can&#8217;t even throw a knife,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She writes a book a year. She lives with her sister and brother-in-law. Her daughter Zo&#235; Elkaim (married to UC Santa Cruz Professor of Engineering Gabriel Elkaim) is her literary agent, and while she was a &#8220;hippie in the hippie world up there,&#8221; UC Santa Cruz was a time of satisfying inquiry for her.</p>
<p>Writing, she says, comes easily for someone who spent years penning papers in graduate school and the fact she&#8217;s written so many books with different characters and locales means she has never been bored with her profession.</p>
<p>She admits, however, to having a discussion last year with her longtime editor, Kate Miciak at Bantam Dell Books, who asked King if she&#8217;d ever consider killing off Mary Russell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, someone who makes her living off writing isn&#8217;t eager to kill off her main character,&#8221; she says. &#8220;On the other hand, there are some interesting things you could do. &#8230;&#8221; She lets her voice trail off.</p>
<p>Her new book, which comes out April 5, is titled <em>The Murder of Mary Russell,</em> and would seem to indicate that, perhaps, King took her editor seriously.</p>
<p>But when a visitor asks King if Russell is no longer among the literary living, she draws an imaginary zipper across her lips.</p>
<p>And while she jokes that she is driven to write &#8220;by bills,&#8221; she later admits that it is her love of storytelling that pushes her creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The storyteller&#8217;s instincts are bone deep, and I think being able to shape a story out of an idea is really deeply satisfying,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And then to see other people are touched by your storytelling? It&#8217;s really quite extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Laurie King will be at Bookshop Santa Cruz at 7 p.m. April 20 to discuss and read from her newest book,</em> The Murder of Mary Russell.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aa819cf280727017266c9f81b3c1069d"><name>eccentric-exoplanet</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An eccentric 'hot Jupiter' yields clues to planet formation and evolution</title><summary>Astronomers investigate how some gas giant planets end up so feverishly close to their stars.</summary><keywords>Greg Laughlin, Jonathan Fortney, hot Jupiter, exoplanet atmospheres, HD 80606b</keywords><start-date>1459179000000</start-date><display-name>An eccentric 'hot Jupiter' yields clues to planet formation and evolution</display-name><path>/2016/03/eccentric-exoplanet</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/eccentric-exoplanet</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1458854534351</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459458331262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Whitney Clavin, JPL</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQn4iVs1_ag?list=PLTiv_XWHnOZrcv46P6T4-u3v53VgGWKkh" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption><span>The exoplanet HD80606 b spends most of its time far from its star, but every 111 days it swings in feverishly close.

Nearly 2,000 exoplanets--planets outside our solar system--have been confirmed so far, and more than 5,000 identified as candidate exoplanets. Many of these exotic worlds belong to a class known as "hot Jupiters." These are gas giants like Jupiter but much hotter, with orbits that take them feverishly close to their stars.</p>
<p>At first, hot Jupiters were considered oddballs, since we don't have anything like them in our own solar system. But as more were found, in addition to many other smaller planets that orbit very closely to their stars, our solar system started to seem like the real misfit.</p>
<p>"We thought our solar system was normal, but that's not so much the case," said Greg Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of a new study from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope that investigates hot Jupiter formation. The study has been accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em></p>
<p>As common as hot Jupiters have become, they are still shrouded in mystery. How did these massive orbs form, and how did they wind up so shockingly close to their stars?</p>
<p>The Spitzer telescope found new clues by observing a hot Jupiter known as HD 80606b, situated 190 light-years from Earth. This planet is unusual in that it has a wildly eccentric orbit almost like that of a comet, swinging very close to its star and then back out to much greater distances over and over again every 111 days. One side of the planet is thought to become dramatically hotter than the other during its harrowing close approaches. In fact, when the planet is closest to its host star, the side facing the star quickly heats up to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1100 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>"As the planet gets closer to the star, it feels a burst of starlight. The atmosphere becomes a cauldron of chemical reactions, and the winds ramp up far beyond hurricane force. It's global warming gone nuts," Laughlin said.</p>
<p><strong>Changing orbit</strong></p>
<p>HD 80606b is thought to be in the process of migrating from a more distant orbit to a much tighter one typical of hot Jupiters. One of the leading theories of hot Jupiter formation holds that gas giants in distant orbits become hot Jupiters when nearby stars or planets gravitationally push them into closer orbits. The planets start out in eccentric orbits, then, over a period of hundreds of millions of years, are thought to gradually settle down into tight, circular orbits.</p>
<p>"This planet is thought to be caught in the act of migrating inward," said Julien de Wit of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, lead author of the new study. "By studying it, we are able to test theories of hot Jupiter formation."</p>
<p>Spitzer previously studied HD 80606b in 2009. The latest observations are more detailed thanks to a longer observing time -- 85 hours -- and improvements in Spitzer's sensitivity to exoplanets.</p>
<p>"The Spitzer data are pristine," said de Wit. "And we were able to observe the planet for much longer this time, giving us more insight into its coldest temperature and how fast it heats up, cools down, and rotates.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key question addressed in the new study is: How long is HD 80606b taking to migrate from an eccentric to a circular orbit? One way to assess this is to look at how "squishy" the planet is. When HD 80606b is in the part of its orbit where it whips closely by its star, the gravity of the star squeezes it. If the planet is squishier, or more pliable, it can better dissipate this gravitational energy as heat. And the more heat is dissipated, the faster the planet will transition to a circular orbit, a process known as circularization.</p>
<p>"If you take a Nerf ball and squeeze it a bunch of times really fast, you'll see that it heats up," said Laughlin. "That's because the Nerf ball is good at transferring that mechanical energy into heat. It's squishy as a result."</p>
<p>The Spitzer results show that HD 80606b does not dissipate much heat when it is squeezed by gravity during its close encounters &#8211; and thus is not squishy, but rather stiffer as a whole. This suggests the planet is not circularizing its orbit as fast as expected, and may take another 10 billion years or more to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Competing theories</strong></p>
<p>"We are starting to learn how long it may take for hot Jupiter migration to occur," de Wit said. "Our theories said it shouldn't take that long because we don't see migrating hot Jupiters very often."</p>
<p>According to Laughlin, "The long time scales we are observing here suggest that a leading migration mechanism may not be as efficient for hot Jupiter formation as once believed."</p>
<p>The Spitzer study suggests that competing theories for hot Jupiter formation, in which gas giants form "in situ" close to their stars or smoothly spiral inward with the help of planet-forming disks, may be preferred.</p>
<p>The new study is also the first to measure the rotation rate of an exoplanet. Spitzer observed changes in the planet's brightness as the planet spun on its axis, finding a rotation period of 90 hours.</p>
<p>"Fifty years ago, we were measuring the rotation rates of planets in our own solar system for the first time. Now we are doing the same thing for planets orbiting other stars. That's pretty amazing," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>A rotation rate of 90 hours is much slower than was predicted for HD 80606b, puzzling astronomers and adding to the enduring mystique of hot Jupiters.</p>
<p>Coauthors of the study include Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz; two of Laughlin's former students, Jonathan Langton of Principia College, Illinois, and Konstantin Batygin of the California Institute of Technology; Nikole Lewis of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore; and Drake Deming of the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

Reich at the Rio Theatre reached capacity before most people even knew he was coming to town.</p>
<p>The event, sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Blum Center, begins at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, April 5 and will be <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/robert-reich/streaming.html">streamed live online</a>, broadcast on KZSC 88.1 FM, and simulcast at the Music Recital Hall on campus. There is also a waiting list for seats at the Rio Theatre. All are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Reich, a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley, will be in conversation on the Rio stage with Heather Bullock, UCSC professor of psychology. His latest book, <em>Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</em> (Knopf, 2015) is the basis for the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>'Inequality for All'</strong></p>
<p>A documentary film, &#8220;<a href="http://inequalityforall.com/">Inequality for All</a>,&#8221; featuring Reich, will be shown at Kresge Town Hall Thursday, March 31 at 6:30 p.m. with an introduction by UCSC Professor Mary Beth Pudup. Admission is free.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inequality for All&#8221; won a special jury award for achievement in filmmaking in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival. Reich and Jacob Kornbluth, the film&#8217;s director, are also co-directors of the Economic Inequality Media Project, a non-profit that creates short videos featuring Reich drawing cartoon explanations of economic issues in easy-to-understand terms.</p>
<p>Reich has become a prolific and well-known progressive commentator on the economy and politics. He is active with the MoveOn.org progressive public policy advocacy group, blogs regularly at robertreich.org, and appears frequently on radio and television news and talk shows. Never shy, he has performed skits with Conan O&#8217;Brien and Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>In <em>Saving Capitalism</em>, Reich argues that power and influence have created a new American oligarchy, a shrinking middle class, and the greatest income inequality and wealth disparity in 80 years. He says the veneration of the &#8220;free market&#8221; has masked the power of moneyed interests to tilt the market to their benefit.</p>
<p>He vigorously backs Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president and notably endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 despite having served four years as President Bill Clinton&#8217;s secretary of labor.</p>
<p><strong>Trump and the 'f' word</strong></p>
<p>In a March 10 blog post at <a href="http://blogs.berkeley.edu/author/rreich/">blogs.berkeley.edu/author/rreich/</a> Reich writes, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reluctant to use the &#160;&#8220;f&#8221; word to describe Donald Trump because it&#8217;s especially harsh, and it&#8217;s too often used carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Trump has finally reached a point where parallels between his presidential campaign and the fascists of the first half of the 20th century&#8211;lurid figures such as Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Oswald Mosley, and Francisco Franco&#8211;are too evident to overlook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reich also served in the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and was part of President Obama's transition advisory board. He has written 14 books, including best-sellers <em>Aftershock</em>, <em>The Work of Nations</em>, and <em>Beyond Outrage</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Blum Center</strong></p>
<p>He is a member of the board of trustees for the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley that focuses on issues of global poverty and inequality. Blum Centers, funded in part by Richard Blum, a UC Regent, investment banker, and husband of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, have been established on all nine UC undergraduate campuses.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary Blum Center at UC Santa Cruz was founded last year and focuses on poverty, social enterprise, and participatory governance.</p>
<p>In 2003, Reich was awarded the Vaclav Havel Vision Foundation Prize, by the former Czech president, for his work in economic and social thought. In 2008, <em>Time Magazine</em> named him one of the 10 most successful cabinet secretaries of the century. He received his B.A. from Dartmouth College, M.A. from Oxford University where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and J.D. from Yale Law School.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/robert-reich/index.html</url><title>More information on Robert Reich's appearance</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/robert-reich/streaming.html</url><title>Watch it live</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3539 </url><title>Screening of 'Inequality for All'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Blum Center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://robertreich.org</url><title>Robert Reich's blog</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://blogs.berkeley.edu/author/rreich/</url><title>Robert Reich's UC Berkeley blog</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ab0f5fc080727017266c9f8183da7dd2"><name>csa-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Farm’s CSA program features 5 percent discount through April 1</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Farm’s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program is open for business and accepting new and renewing members.</summary><start-date>1458858540000</start-date><display-name>Community Supported Agriculture 2016 </display-name><path>/2016/03/csa-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/csa-2016</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1458863824795</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1458864823722</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/csa_box-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/csa_box-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csa_box-450.jpg</name><display-name>csa_box-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>306670</file-size><width>425</width><height>644</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/csa_box-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/csa_box-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csa_box-80.jpg</name><display-name>csa_box-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20219</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members receive a box of freshly picked organic produce from the UCSC Farm each week while supporting one of the nation&#8217;s longest-running organic farming and gardening training programs.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Farm&#8217;s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program is open for business and accepting new and renewing members.</p>
<p>Members receive a box of freshly picked organic produce from the UCSC Farm each week while supporting one of the nation&#8217;s longest-running organic farming and gardening training programs. People who sign up by Friday, April 1, will receive a 5 percent discount on the share price.</p>
<p>The 22-week CSA season runs from early June through early November; a &#8220;late season&#8221; plans begins in mid August.</p>
<p>A share of produce contains a diverse supply of freshly harvested organic fruits and vegetables throughout the season (roughly 8&#8211;13 items per week) and is designed to feed a household of two or three for a week, or a larger family that perhaps doesn't cook every day but still wants to eat fresh, organic, and local.</p>
<p>The CSA full-season rate will be $560 again this year, with optional payment plans. Sign-ups postmarked by April 1, 2016 will qualify for a 5 percent discount ($532 for a full share, $266 for a late-season share). Limited-income shares are available, and SNAP benefits are accepted for CSA payments.</p>
<p>New this year will be an optional flower share to add to a CSA box from late June through late August. Flower share members&#160;will receive one large bouquet&#160;a week, featuring seasonal blooms from farm fields. Species and colors will change with the season, but members can expect annual and perennial blooms including snapdragons, dahlias, zinnias, strawflower, celosia, stock, lisianthus, and much more.&#160;Additional flowers can be purchased at the farm stand on Tuesdays and Fridays. The flower share will be an additional $10 per week for 10 weeks.&#160;</p>

<p>Last year, the organizers of Alumni Weekend set up a new online portal that lets Slugs know the names of alumni who plan to show up to this gala event that runs from Thursday, April 28, through Sunday, May 1.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2090&amp;cid=3849&amp;fid=3848">See Who&#8217;s Coming link</a> was very popular in 2015, and now it&#8217;s back again. This year&#8217;s portal is sure to get loads of clicks from enquiring minds: Is your old roommate going to show up to Alumni Weekend this year? How about your resident advisor, your best pal from sophomore year, the friends who served with you on the Student Union Assembly, or your secret crush in lower-division general chemistry?</p>
<p>Aside from this irresistible portal, which already has hundreds of responses filling up eight web pages, there will be plenty of enticements to draw Slugs from all over the nation. Here is a highly abridged and deeply subjective compendium of event highlights.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re coming to Alumni Weekend, or feel tempted to do so, you owe it to yourself to scroll through the <em>entire</em> list of published events to make sure you come up with a schedule that works for you. All you have to do is <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html#!">just click on this link</a>, and when you see an event that strikes your fancy, you can press a little tab that expands the information paragraph about each event, and also press a tab that allows you to register for each event in advance&#8212;always a good policy, considering that some events can fill up very quickly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are just a few options for you to consider:</p>
<h3>Friday festivities</h3>
<p>Early Slugs who are on campus at 10 a.m. Friday, April 29, can attend &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3385">The Jungle And The Beast</a>,&#8221; a conversation with UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor Lewis Watts and intrepid Salvadoran journalist &#211;scar Mart&#237;nez, who provides a close-up look at "the Beast," the decrepit train that travels from Central America through Mexico to the United States. Thousands of migrants cling to the train on their journey northward.</p>
<p>Also that Friday, graduate research will be in the spotlight during the <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/symposium/index.html">12<sup>th</sup> annual Graduate Research Symposium</a> starting at 1 p.m. at McHenry Library. The Institute of the Arts and Sciences will hold an open house at 2 p.m. at the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC). That busy afternoon will also be a chance to tour the &#8220;Collective Museum,&#8221; a walk and interpretive tour that will give visitors a vivid sense of a campus-wide art project. The tour departs from the Digital Arts Research Center, room 302, at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>That evening, Slugs will also have a chance to see two brilliant minds in conversation when alumnus Lawrence Weschler (Cowell '72), an acclaimed nonfiction author and former <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer, has <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3561">a provocative interview</a> with acclaimed Los Angeles&#8211;based artist Ramiro Gomez, followed by a Q&amp;A with Gomez. The talk starts at 4 p.m. at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge. In case you want to brush up on your knowledge of this up-and-coming artist, read Weschler&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2015%2F08%2F16%2Fmagazine%2Framiro-gomezs-domestic-disturbances.html%3F_r%3D0">recent thought-provoking profile of Gomez</a> in the <em>New York Times.</em></p>
<p>Then, as the sun is setting and the shadows spreading across the redwood-lined campus, alumni will attend a highly anticipated welcome keynote event called &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3524">How We Learn: An Evening With John Dizikes,&#8221;</a> featuring the beloved professor emeritus of American studies, a founding UC Santa Cruz faculty member. He will be in conversation with Weschler and other special guests. The talk starts at 7 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<h3>Saturday, what a day</h3>
<p>On Saturday, if they get there early enough, revelers may perk up with <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3401">Coffee in the Cowell Courtyard</a>, starting at 8:30 a.m. in the (you guessed it) Cowell Courtyard. Or they could take part in a <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3402">birding walk at the CASFS/UC Santa Cruz Farm</a>, a tour that also starts at 8:30 a.m. (decisions, decisions!).</p>
<p>For adventurous souls who would like to see what is happening out at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s famous marine complex a few miles off the main campus, <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3400">Younger Lagoon will be the focal point of a &#8220;Bioblitz&#8221; event</a> that kicks off at 9 a.m. at Long Marine Laboratory. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ucsc-bioblitz">Another Bioblitz unfolds at the same</a> time on campus at the Horticulture 2 classroom of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. And if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the term Bioblitz, <em>National Geographic</em> describes it as an event "in which teams of volunteer scientists, families, students, teachers, and other community members work together to find and identify as many species of plants, animals, microbes, fungi, and other organisms as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you like coffee, you won't want to miss alumnus James Freeman (Stevenson '90, philosophy), founder of premier Bay Area coffee roasting company Blue Bottle Coffee, who will have a one-on-one interview during the True Originals alumni panel called "<a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html#event_3620">Brewing up Success: The Story of Blue Bottle Coffee</a>." The talk is at 10 a.m. at Oakes College.</p>
<p>Proud parents of energetic little Sluggers will be happy to see the return of the <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3405">Banana Slug Kid Zone</a>, a family stop and play area on the Oakes Upper Lawn starting at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a fan of letterpress art and hand-crafted books, as well as cherished campus traditions, head over to the Page Smith Library at Cowell College at 10 a.m. to take in <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3409">a panel on the early days of the Cowell Press</a>. At this point, nostalgic Slugs may wish they could clone themselves and be more than one place at once, because their fellow alumni will provide an intimate walking tour, starting at 10 a.m., of the Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater, a great opportunity to learn about the restoration plans for this beautiful campus meeting place, music venue, and landmark.</p>
<p>Then, at 12:30 p.m., Slugs will converge for one of the most highly anticipated events of the weekend, the <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3417">Banana Slug Lunch at College Eight Courtyard</a>, featuring farm-to-fork food. After being well-fortified, Slugs can then brace themselves to make a tough decision for 2:30 p.m. The Teach-Ins&#8212;informal classroom lecture events&#8212;are back and ready for a new batch of students.</p>
<p>Do the returning Slugs want to take in a talk called &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3422">How To Clone A Mammoth&#8221;</a> with professor Beth Shapiro, who jointly runs the UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Lab and teaches in the Physical and Biological Sciences Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department? Or would they prefer a thought-provoking talk by the legendary Elliot Aronson, professor emeritus of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, whose presentation has a truly irresistible title:<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3423">&#160;&#8220;The Power of Self Persuasion: My 55 Years of Research in One Hour</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as evening rolls along, it&#8217;s time to head over to downtown Santa Cruz, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/kuumbwa-alumni-weekend-jazz-event.html">where an immersive jazz experience</a>, combining conversation and performance, will await adventurous Slugs at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. The special event will feature a conversation on the history of jazz by experts in the field, followed by the vocal styling of jazz singer Kim Nalley, a Bay Area favorite and up-and-coming star who has performed all over the world, and is also a jazz scholar in her own right.</p>
<p>Before the performance, Nalley, along with UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean Tyler Stovall, and UC Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter, will give a thought-provoking presentation about global jazz history as it relates to race, class, and culture.</p>
<h3>Sunday: Fun day</h3>
<p>First off, check the schedule this morning to see when the brunch for your college is being held. Then set some time aside for a moment of reflection during the annual Ceremony of Remembrance at 11:30 a.m. at the Cowell Provost&#8217;s Inner Courtyard. Then, the wisdom of ages and the spirit of youth will converge at noon at Kresge Town Hall at Kresge College for <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3434">&#8220;We Are Wiser Together: Igniting Possibilities Through Intergenerational Connections.&#8221;</a></p>

<p><strong>Professor Emeritus Dilip Basu passed away on February 22, 2016 in Santa Clarita, Ca. His family has asked that the following obituary be shared with the campus:</strong></p>
<p>It is with great sadness we announce the passing of Dilip Basu, Research Professor of Humanities, Founding Director of Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection, University of California Santa Cruz, and since June 2015, Senior Research Fellow, Packard Humanities Institute, Santa Clarita, California. He passed away peacefully of natural causes on February 22, 2016 in Santa Clarita, California.</p>
<p>Dilip was born on August 16, 1938 in Chirirbandar, a village in East Bengal, India prior to the 1947 partition of the subcontinent. The seventh of eleven children (with four brothers and six sisters), he acquired a love of history while a student at the village school. After the partition of India in 1947 and their migration to Calcutta, the Basus became <em>bona fide</em> refugees. For a period the family was scattered, the parents moving away from Calcutta while the elder children remained in the city to attend college.</p>
<p>Dilip attended high school and college in Calcutta, in the process falling in love with modern Bengali poetry, then in a state of resurgence after the partition. However soon after beginning his studies at Presidency College he became seriously ill from malnutrition. As a result his parents had to return to the city, barely managing to stay together, in order to care for him. After his recovery, Dilip completed his B.A. in 1959 from Presidency College, garnering gold medals for excellence in History and in his subsequent M.A. History degree.</p>
<p>This academic success allowed him scholarships that brought him to the U.S. to undertake graduate study in history, in the process becoming interested in the history of modern China. He received an M.A. from Harvard University in Chinese history and began to map out his dissertation topic. He did his doctoral studies at the University of California at Berkeley under Professor Frederick Wakeman. In 1974 he completed his dissertation on &#8220;Asian Merchants and Western Trade: A Comparative Study of Calcutta and Canton, 1800-1840.&#8221; In this phase of his career, his work was focused primarily on the history of modern China and its relations with British colonial India. Dilip Basu had by this time, in 1971, joined the faculty at the University of California at Santa Cruz as Acting Assistant Professor of History, after stints as a visiting instructor at UC Berkeley and the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Initially named a Fellow of Stevenson College, Basu joined Herman Blake in the founding of Oakes College in 1972. In 1989 he became a Fellow of Merrill College. In this first phase of his academic career he taught and wrote primarily about European imperialism in East Asia. He chaired the Programs on East Asian Studies and South and Southeast Asian Studies. Publications from this period include the edited volumes Nineteenth Century China: Five Imperialist Perspectives (1972) and The Rise and Growth of Colonial Port Cities in Asia (1985). He recently returned to this subject in a widely praised article, &#8220;Chinese Xenology and the Opium War: Reflections on Sinocentrism,&#8221; The Journal of Asian Studies, (2014) Vol. 73, 927-940.</p>
<p>By the 1990s Dilip&#8217;s research and teaching interests gradually returned to South Asian history, initiating a second phase of his career, one in which he would invest his energies in developing a South Asian Studies program at UCSC. He reworked his South Asian courses to incorporate new cultural approaches, including dance, music, folklore and film. In this period he also helped establish the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment in Classical Indian Music and the Hasan Endowed Chair in Hindustani Music at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Eventually his fascination with the history of Indian film would lead him to the third and most significant phase of his career, his involvement with the films of Satyajit Ray, the great Indian filmmaker and director. In this period, Dilip&#8217;s research and writing focused upon the Cinema of Satyajit Ray and works of Rabindranath Tagore. His translation of Tagore&#8217;s famous novel, <em>The Last Poem: A Novel</em>, was published in 2011 by Harper Perennial in India, where it is a best seller. Another book, Satyajit Ray&#8217;s <em>Goddess: From Story to Film</em>, is scheduled for publication this year by the Packard Humanities Institute.</p>
<p>Basu&#8217;s establishment of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Center at UC Santa Cruz ranks as his most important accomplishment. Funded by grants from the Packard Humanities Institute, the Ray FASC (http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu) became internationally famous as the principal archive for the work of this master of Indian film.</p>
</div>
Among many awards he received in this period, Basu was honored by the Academy of Motions Pictures Arts &amp; Sciences and the Cultural Council of Bengal of New York. In September 2014, the Academy Film Archive in Los Angeles felicitated Dilip for his coordination of the Ray film restoration. He was also the recipient of a major grant from the Indian Council of Cultural Relations in New Delhi for the operations of the Ray Center and for hosting major cultural events and lectures. 
<p>In 2013 the Dean of the Humanities Division appointed him a Research Professor of Humanities Division. In 2015, he was named Steward of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection, defined as part of his own research and took up an appointment as Senior Research Fellow at the Packard Humanities Institute in Santa Clarita.</p>
<p>Dilip leaves behind his wife, Dayani Basu and a daughter, Amiya Basu Jackling, from an earlier marriage to Cathy Shender. Other relatives include Chris Jackling; a younger brother, Asish Basu who followed him to the US; his nephews, Rishi Basu and Neil Basu; a stepdaughter Pallavi Sonia Rao and two step-grandchildren; and four surviving siblings, and their children and grandchildren in India. In addition to his family, he leaves behind numerous close friends and admirers in the US, and in India.</p>
<p>A memorial celebration of his life will be held at the Cultural Integration Fellowship (CIF) <em>2650 Fulton Street, San Francisco, CA 94118</em> at <em>4 PM May 29, 2016</em>. Condolences may be sent to Mrs. Dayani Basu (<em>c/o The PHI Stoa 26155 Rockwell Canyon Road, Santa Clarita, CA 91355</em>) or to Mr. Asish Basu (<em>328 Troy Road, Rochester, NY 14618</em>). In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Dilip Basu&#8217;s name to the Cultural Integration Fellowship. Please RSVP at any of the above Basu addresses if you plan to attend the memorial celebration. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>A memorial gathering for the UC Santa Cruz community will also take place on Thursday, May 26, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on campus at the Merrill Provost House.

<br/>
 &#8220;I chose the theme &#8216;Out of Line&#8217; because it characterizes the way many of these writers work across genres and generally seem to prize the element of surprise in their writing,&#8221; says literature professor Micah Perks. &#8220;I'm hoping it will encourage our students to think outside the box and have fun with their writing.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The series kicks off on April 7 with <strong>Githa Hariharan</strong>, who was born in Coimbatore, India, and grew up in Bombay and Manila. Inspired by Italo Calvino&#8217;s writing about journeys and cities, her latest book, <em>Almost Home: Finding A Place in the World From Kashmir to New York</em>, combines memoir, travelogue, history, philosophy, and fiction to create layered stories about places around the globe.<br/>
<br/>
 Alumna <strong>Kate Schatz</strong> is a fiction writer and high school teacher, who combined her double major in feminist studies and creative writing to come up with the bestselling <em>Rad American Women, A-Z</em>. Her book has the distinction of being the first children&#8217;s book published by San Francisco&#8217;s famed City Lights Publishers in the company&#8217;s 60-year history. Schatz returns to UC Santa Cruz for her reading on April 14.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Manuel Gonzales</strong>, a writer in the witty tradition of George Saunders and Aimee Bender, will make an appearance on April 21. &#8220;He writes stories about wives who are made to feel small&#8212;literally--and take their terrible revenge, and passengers who live on a plane that never lands,&#8221; Perks noted. Or as one critic put it: &#8220;The 18 stories in Gonzales&#8217;s exhilarating first book, <em>The Miniature Wife: and Other Stories</em>, render the fantastic commonplace and the ordinary extraordinary.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Charlie Jane Anders'</strong>s first novel, <em>All The Birds In The Sky</em>, combines romance, sci-fi, fantasy, and dystopia in a smart novel about a witch and a tech genius who fall in love at the end of the world in San Francisco. Anders reads on April 28.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz alumna <strong>Elizabeth McKenzie</strong> is already a Baily Prize finalist for her latest novel, The <em>Portable Veblen</em>, receiving rave reviews from <em>The New Yorker</em> to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. Her book combines the philosophy of Thorstein Veblen with a talking squirrel to look at love, dysfunctional families, conspicuous consumption, and traumatic brain injuries. McKenzie returns to campus to read on May 12.<br/>
<br/>
 The series also includes <strong>Lev Grossman</strong> on May 19, the book critic at <em>Time</em> magazine since 2002. Grossman is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>The Magicians</em> trilogy, which is now a television show on the Syfy channel.<br/>
<br/>
 Emerging San Francisco poets, <strong>Emily Hunt</strong> and J<strong>ulien Poirier</strong> round out the series on May 26.<br/>

You read that correctly: the question wasn't whether we had ever experienced sexual harassment in our careers, but whether we had experienced it during our annual three-day conference.</p>
<p>I've been in the academy for decades, as a researcher, professor, and now as provost here at UC Santa Cruz. I am not easily surprised. But I was outraged at the results:<em>&#160;20 percent&#160;</em>of the female participants reported having been the victims of unwanted sexual advances during this short conference; 40 percent reported hearing unwelcome comments of a sexual nature. And not just women reported being harassed.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment and sexual violence are terrible in any context, when perpetrated by anyone. But there is something especially destructive to the academy when the perpetrator is a faculty member.</p>
<p>This spring, I am convening a dialogue to bring together Academic Senate leaders, students, and faculty members. It will be from 4 to 6 p.m. on May 10 at Kresge College's Town Hall. We must define concrete mechanisms that administrators and faculty can adopt, above and beyond what is required by law or policy, to advance a culture of service to each other and our students.</p>
<p>Faculty members have a special duty. We serve as role models. We are supposed to mentor our students, uplift junior scholars, and honor our colleagues. These are our oaths, real as any Hippocratic Oath taken by a doctor. Any faculty member who conditions his or her mentorship of students or assistance to colleagues on their sexual availability has betrayed this oath.</p>
<p>As a forensic anthropologist, I am trained to think in terms of evidence. All human activity leaves something behind-a mark, an impact, a wound. Sexual harassment and sexual violence leave deep, painful wounds-first and foremost on direct victims. But such conduct also pollutes our culture and community. It slashes at heart of the very meaning of "university," which is a place of inclusion and growth.</p>
<p>As a woman and a leader, I am pleased that the University of California has taken significant steps to strengthen our policies against sexual harassment and sexual violence and our procedures for protecting victims, while ensuring fairness for all concerned.</p>
<p>As faculty members, we must go much further. We, as faculty, must do more than comply with mere law or university policy. Indeed, compliance to these standards is a basic job requirement. Sexual harassment isn't just a compliance problem; it is a culture problem. And beyond procedures and codes of conduct, we must hold ourselves-and each other-accountable for creating a culture of transformative service. I am speaking of service in the Greek sense of the word: caring for others and making their needs a priority.</p>
<p>In a culture of transformative service, we as faculty would promise to do more than merely refrain from harassing conduct. The expectation should be that every student, every colleague is better in some material &#160;way for having worked with us or learned from us. That is more than the absence of bad conduct; it is the presence of active and genuine service. While we have extraordinary faculty who honor this principle already in their daily work, I believe there is value in stating this principle clearly and making ourselves accountable for following it across the board.</p>
<p>Our students get it. A few weeks ago, I met with a group of students protesting for stronger protections against sexual harassment and for more faculty accountability. I agree with many of their points and know it is time to take action. I am starting with myself and with my colleagues on the faculty. Ultimately, we are the stewards of our faculty culture, and we are responsible for creating the culture in which all students and university members can work, teach, and pursue knowledge.</p>
<p>I have seen too many students leave academia because they cannot endure the harassment or being forced to choose between advancing in their careers and maintaining their dignity. I have seen too many colleagues slowed and disillusioned by gender discrimination and harassment. Indeed, I have seen perpetrators not only remain in academia but advance to positions of leadership. This issue is no longer one about compliance with the law and university policy but a total and radical culture change that must start now.</p>
<p>I welcome those who doubt that things can or will change to join the dialogue, as well as those who have been affected by sexual harassment and sexual violence, directly or indirectly. My hope is that we can begin to create a higher, more just basis of engagement between faculty and the broader university community. We must unite to be the change we want to see in the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c360a42080727017266c9f81fa18a60e"><name>grad-slam-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grad students face off in second annual Grad Slam competition April 6</title><summary>Ten graduate students will face off April 6 in the second annual Grad Slam competition, a spirited forum during which doctoral students present their research in three minutes.</summary><start-date>1459271700000</start-date><display-name>Grad Slam </display-name><path>/2016/03/grad-slam-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/grad-slam-2016</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1459271803895</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459273533675</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/Smith-Justine-440.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/Smith-Justine-440.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Smith-Justine-440.jpg</name><display-name>Smith-Justine-440.jpg</display-name><file-size>245916</file-size><width>440</width><height>507</height></image><image-alt>justine smith</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Doctoral candidate Justine Smith won the 2015 Grad Slam with her presentation of research with pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ten graduate students will face off April 6 in the second annual Grad Slam competition, a spirited forum during which doctoral students present their research in three minutes.</p>

<p>The Original Thinkers speaker series, launched in May 2014, has faculty members traveling across the country to share their work and insight in a format designed for the general public.</p>
<p>Professor Craig Haney, who has spent his career probing the psychology of imprisonment and the causes of violent crime, will deliver the <a href="http://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;pgid=2161&amp;gid=1&amp;cid=4029&amp;ecid=4029&amp;post_id=0">next talk</a> on Wednesday in San Jose.</p>
<p>It is titled "Are We Bending Toward Justice? The Urgency (and Possibility) of Criminal Justice Reform." Haney will deliver the same talk <a href="http://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;pgid=2100&amp;gid=1&amp;cid=3922&amp;ecid=3922&amp;post_id=0">next month</a> in Los Angeles.<br/>
 Groundbreaking genomics researchers from UC Santa Cruz will be featured at a May 24 event in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Professor Raphael Kudela and Assistant Professor Kristy Kroeker together talked about the <a href="http://reports.news.ucsc.edu/west-coast/">drought, the warm water blob in the ocean, and toxic algae</a> in February in Watsonville.</p>
<p>"My research is really motivated by a desire to support healthy ecosystems and local communities in our coastal zones," Kroeker said. "Having our own community understand how the ocean is changing and engaged in conversations about the challenges is really critical for developing sustainability."</p>
<p>Kroeker said the event was a great opportunity to engage with folks in the community to learn more about their concerns and questions.</p>
<p>Last fall, Professor <a href="../../2014/10/hunicke-games-art.xml">Robin Hunicke</a> and UCSC alum <a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2016/03/maybe-they-wont-kill-you/">Akira Thompson</a> talked about new directions in design and games in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Hunicke is the director of the new Art, Games &amp; Playable Media BA program at UC Santa Cruz. A game designer and producer by training, she has a background in computer science, fine art and applied game studies.</p>
<p>Thompson is owner and Game Designer of RainBros which recently released the IndieCade award nominated art game "...&amp;maybetheywontkillyou" a live action role playing game about being poor and Black in America.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c46dd71180727017266c9f81faed0937"><name>lick-field-trip</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory field trip available to undergraduate students</title><summary>Seeing and Knowing in Art and Astronomy offers undergraduates a chance to learn about the Lick Observatory's history and take part in workshops. </summary><keywords>art, astronomy, undergraduates, lick observatory, </keywords><start-date>1459263600000</start-date><display-name>Lick field trip</display-name><path>/2016/03/lick-field-trip</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/lick-field-trip</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1459289446120</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459290027545</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Undergraduate students have an opportunity through the Institute for the Arts and Sciences to learn about the intersections between art and astronomy.</p>
<p>On May 20&#8212;21, students will join astronomers and artists for a&#160;two-day field trip to the historic UC Lick Observatory on top of Mount Hamilton. As part of Seeing and Knowing in Art and Astronomy, they will learn about the Lick&#8217;s history and take part in workshops.</p>
<p>These workshops will use the Lick Observatory's resources&#8212;its immense telescopes, and archive of historical photographs, documents, and astronomical instruments&#8212;to ask questions about the relationship between how we see and how we know.</p>
<p>Working with artists and astronomers, students can explore how&#160;expectations, tools and technology, professional training, institutional framing, and our own values and histories influence perception.&#160;</p>
<p>Students participating in the workshop will be eligible to team up to apply for grants of up to $1,500 to fund one-time art and science projects such as mini-exhibitions, student events, performances, speakers, and more. Transportation, food, and accommodations are provided.</p>

 &#160;<br/>
 Finding a fawn (baby&#160;deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the&#160;campus police department 459-2231&#160;or&#160;county&#160;Animal Control:&#160;831-454-7227.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.<br/>

 </article-subhead><article-text><p>A distinguished group of speakers will explore the question, &#8220;How do we learn?,&#8221; at a brand-new Alumni Weekend event that will range from the world of virtual reality to the potentials of adaptive learning techniques and the importance of mentorship.</p>
<p>This TED Talks&#8211;style &#8220;<a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html#!">welcome keynote</a>&#8221; celebration will take place at 7 p.m., April 29, at the Stevenson Event Center. The talk will include the celebrated professor emeritus of American studies and founding UC Santa Cruz faculty member John Dizikes; notable alumni author Lawrence Weschler (Cowell '74, philosophy and western civilization); and special guests, including psychology professor Steve Whittaker, a professor in human-computer interaction, and Ted Warburton, theater arts professor.</p>
<p><a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/index.html">Alumni Weekend</a> is April 28&#8211;May 1, 2016. <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html">Events</a> are centered on campus, with some events in other nearby locations in the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>Dizikes, during his 35-year career at UC Santa Cruz, was a professor of history, a professor and co-founder of the American Studies Department, and a provost of Cowell College. He has a wide breadth of knowledge, and a passion for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>When he addresses the crowd that evening, Dizikes will draw from his long career, but he&#8217;ll also tap into the lessons he learned from his own mentors.</p>
<p>When asked to address the mystery of learning, Dizikes said there is no substitute for caring and attentive teachers who can engage and draw out students in a thoughtful way.</p>
<p>During his teaching career, he loved those &#8220;marvelous moments when the light went on in students&#8217; eyes, and I could tell something had registered," he said. "It&#8217;s important that you help them discover these things for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dizikes has had plenty of help along the way to this realization.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was blessed by innumerable helpful teachers who pushed things along, opened things up, and encouraged me to do things I never could have imagined,&#8221; Dizikes said.</p>
<p>The college years are &#8220;an impressionable age,&#8221; he continued. Some students struggle at first to find their place in a supercharged environment full of bright young minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I found that just saying to people, &#8216;Wait a minute, this is a good piece of work, but why don&#8217;t you think about this other aspect of it, or why don&#8217;t you reconsider this part?,'" he said. "That was enormously important, the intimate scale of those first 25 years. I got to know all the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawrence Weschler spent more than 20 years as an award-winning writer for <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine. Weschler, the author of 14 books, has taught at UC Santa Cruz, as well as Princeton University, Columbia University, Bard College, Vassar College, Sarah Lawrence College, and New York University, where he is currently the director of the New York Institute for the Humanities.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing you need to pick up across four years of college is how to learn, and one subset of that is how to ask questions, how to frame questions, and how to be in a questioning mode,&#8221; Weschler said. &#8220;If you come out of college with those skills, the rest of your life is a college education. You are in college so you can learn how to treat the rest of your life as an ongoing occasion for learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weschler will also <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3561">join noted young Mexican-American artist Ramiro Gomez for a conversation</a> at Stevenson Fireside Lounge before the keynote. The discussion begins at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Weschler, whose recent profile of Gomez appeared in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/magazine/ramiro-gomezs-domestic-disturbances.html?_r=0"><em>New York Times</em></a>, &#160;said that the artist, in an &#8220;extremely thoughtful&#8221; way, creates scenes of fancy homes so clean, well-managed and lavish &#8220;that the people who live in the houses must have an army of workers &#8230; who are disposable.&#8221;</p>
<p>In doing so, Gomez captures the vulnerability and humanity of workers on the margins. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;(Gomez) talks about the way domestic workers and undocumented workers often feel they don&#8217;t have the right to go into museums and galleries, that these places are not for them,&#8221; Weschler continued. &#8220;He is not only trying to draw attention to them but make them see that they are worthy of being part of the cultural dialogue.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c98dfcac80727017266c9f81db0aff46"><name>isbister-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores the emotional power of games</title><summary>Katherine Isbister presents a new way to think about videogames and their effects on people who play them.</summary><keywords>Katherine Isbister, videogames, computer games, computational media, effects of videogames</keywords><start-date>1459436400000</start-date><display-name>New book explores the emotional power of games</display-name><path>/2016/03/isbister-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/isbister-book</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1459375438967</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459880622016</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/cover-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/cover-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-400.jpg</name><display-name>cover-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>71088</file-size><width>400</width><height>588</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/03/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/03/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16645</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image from book cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In her new book, <em>How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design,</em> Katherine Isbister presents a new way to think about videogames and their effects on people who play them.</p>
<p>A professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz, Isbister sees games as a cultural medium on a par with books, films, and music, and just as worthy of serious consideration and analysis.</p>
<p>"We don't talk in a sophisticated manner about games the way we do about films and books," she says. "I wanted to convey what is unique about games and point out the design innovations that enable games to affect users in new and emotionally powerful ways."</p>
<p>With the soaring popularity of videogames has come the inevitable handwringing over their effects on children and society. Some critics have argued that games are creating a generation of isolated, emotionally numb, antisocial loners. According to Isbister, however, games can actually play a powerful role in creating empathy and other strong, positive emotional experiences. In the book's introduction, she describes it as "a guided tour of exactly how games can influence emotion and social connection, with examples that unpack the experience of the gamer."</p>
<p>Isbister draws her examples from a broad range of games, including popular "AAA" games, indie games, art games, and avant-garde projects. By exposing readers to a larger variety of game genres and experiences than they may have encountered, she hopes to expand the cultural conversation about games while giving readers the terms and tools for an informed analysis of games and game experiences.</p>
<p>"I also hope this book will raise the esteem in which games are held as an innovative and powerful medium for doing what all media do--helping us understand ourselves and explore what it means to be human," she writes.</p>
<p><em>How Games Move Us</em> is part of the Playful Thinking book series from MIT Press.<br/>

Blitzer gallery on the west side of Santa Cruz.<br/>
 <br/>
 "This is the first large-scale faculty show in over 10 years,&#8221; noted Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham. &#8220;We are asking faculty members to show recent work that will spark a conversation. And we&#8217;re excited to open the conversation to all campus and community members.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The artwork will range from computer technologies, such as video mapping, transmedia storytelling, and photo-digital intaglio printmaking with laser-cutting processes, to classical painting, drawing, and sculpture. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I wanted to show the range of mediums and concepts being taught here at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;We thought about doing a smaller theme-based faculty show, but we decided to show the depth and breadth of the faculty members. There are themes of environmentalism, queerness, participatory culture, and social justice in the exhibition,&#8221; she added.<br/>
 <br/>
 Graham noted that highlights of the show include work by award-winning faculty members such as Dee Hibbert-Jones, who recently received an Oscar nomination for her animated short documentary film, <em>Last Day of Freedom</em>; Elizabeth Stephens, winner of a 2014 Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship Award; and new professors, A. Laurie Palmer from the Art Institute of Chicago, and Enrique Leal from the University of Castilla La Mancha, Spain. <br/>
 <br/>
 <em><strong>In Conversation with UCSC Studio Art Faculty</strong></em> opens at the Porter Sesnon Art Gallery on Thursday, April 7, followed by a second opening at the R. Blitzer Gallery on Friday, April 8. It will run at both venues through May 7. <br/>
 <br/>
 Graham encouraged the community to attend the opening night receptions, which will take place at each of the galleries. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The receptions will be a chance to meet the artists and talk about their work,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also have a few conversation games to kick off the evenings. We want to encourage people to talk to each other.&#8221; <br/>

<p>&#8220;I call it architectonic drawing,&#8221; Buchanan explains as he sketches in the warm light of the converted North Coast farm shed that houses his studio. &#8220;It&#8217;s the idea of observing a subject matter that is fully organic but drawing it in a way that conveys its underlying geometric structure. I&#8217;m superimposing a planar logic upon the organic form.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Buchanan, 39, sounds more like a scientist than an artist, it&#8217;s no accident. The UC Santa Cruz lecturer and alumnus (Porter '00) is a disciple of classical art, a man who is bringing the exacting study of anatomy and classic technique into the 21<sup>st</sup> century and exposing scores of UC Santa Cruz students who have taken his popular figure drawing and painting classes over the past eight years.&#160;</p>
<p>Says Buchanan simply, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always gravitated toward things that are technically complicated. Classical drawing and training involve levels of technical complication that intrigue me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buchanan grew up in Southern California, the only child of a single mom who was a writer. According to his mother, she put art books into his crib when he was an infant, so it probably wasn&#8217;t much of a surprise when, in fourth grade, Buchanan began making lifelike drawings of his own hand. Or that, when he went to the movies, he&#8217;d watch the way shadow and light played across the actors&#8217; faces instead of following the plot.</p>
<p>But it was at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts that Buchanan was pulled, almost obsessively, into the study of human anatomy. Even after his assignments were done, he says, he&#8217;d spend hours copying diagrams from Robert Beverly Hale and Dr. Paul Richer&#8217;s <em>Artistic Anatomy</em> book and quizzing himself on the names of bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments.</p>
<p>&#8220;My intention is to depict the figure as an anatomical event that houses the spirit of the human condition,&#8221; Buchanan says. &#8220;There are so many poetic notions associated with the heart and lungs, and the idea that these vital elements are carried along inside the vessel of the human figure as we search, struggle, fail, and succeed is a beautiful idea to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he talks, his terrier-lab mix, Poppy, barks through the screen door at a passing cat. Outside is a spread of Brussels sprout fields, a steel-blue ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;To explain the need for the study of anatomy, I give my students this analogy,&#8221; Buchanan says, asking a visitor to imagine being an artist who must draw a still life of a sheet draped over a set of unknown objects. Then, the sheet would be pulled back to reveal the unknown objects and the artist would make a second drawing. The final drawing would be a still life of the original scene of sheet-draped objects.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third drawing you would make now is so much more informed by the underlying structure and reveals what is causing the surface of the sheet to behave as it does,&#8221; Buchanan says. &#8220;And you would find that this new drawing is profoundly more complex, intellectual, and natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the same way with the human figure, he says.</p>
<p>Former students tell of Buchanan lecturing in front of his classes, sketching exquisite renderings of a human arm or a shoulder blade on sheets of brown paper as he describes the structure, name, and mechanical function of the muscles and bones in each.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of the drawings he does, I want to frame and put in my house,&#8221; says Jill Steinberg, 65, a retired psychology professor from San Jose State University who describes Buchanan as a brilliant teacher who is respectful of each student.</p>
<p>&#8220;His work is interdisciplinary,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Roxanne Kaplan, 22 (Kresge &#8217;15, art), who works at a fine arts studio in Mountain View, calls Buchanan &#8220;inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave me the foundation for all my future artwork,&#8221; Kaplan says. &#8220;Now that I know the guidelines for portraying the human form, I can consciously break set rules to generate certain feelings or messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Buchanan&#8217;s own time at UC Santa Cruz, he gravitated to Emeritus Art Professor Frank Galuszka, who encouraged him to depict the human figure in a narrative content.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pushed me to embrace the figure spiritually, mythically, and heroically,&#8221; Buchanan says. &#8220;Galuszka mentored me into more ambitious challenges of tackling multiple figure compositions with content, narrative, and meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next to Buchanan is a large work-in-progress he&#8217;s titled, &#8220;Apollo Crowned Glorious While Instructing a Child in the Art of Music.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looks at the painting, which harkens back to works by 17<sup>th</sup> century Spanish painter Diego Velazquez. &#8220;The human figure here,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is used for the purpose of recognition that within God is man and vice versa.&#8221;</p>
<p>A surfer, guitarist, and admitted throwback to the times of Carravagio and Titian, Buchanan has exhibited from New York to London, shows at the Robert Pence Gallery in San Francisco, and was commissioned to paint two large murals at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wis.</p>
<p>&#8220;My principle passion in making figurative paintings is the idea of interface between the divine and the mortal, and I think that explains my passion for anatomy beyond the scientific,&#8221; Buchanan says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more I study the human body, the more miraculous its design and structure become to me, and the more I stand in awe of the idea that, within the science of nature, is art.&#8221;</p>

Or the shuttle bus drivers, janitors, security guards, and landscapers who serve the region&#8217;s tech elite.</p>
<p>This largely invisible workforce is the focus of a new report by Chris Benner, UC Santa Cruz professor of environmental studies and sociology, and Kyle Neering, a UCSC &#160;economics graduate student. <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/main/wp-content/uploads/Contract-Workforce-Assessment.pdf"><em>Silicon Valley Technology Industries Contract Workforce Assessment</em></a> explores inequalities that prevail in the population that serves the tech elite. &#160;</p>
<p>The study was done in collaboration with <a href="http://www.wpusa.org/">Working Partnerships USA</a>, a Silicon Valley community organization that seeks to bring together public policy and the power of grassroots organizing to promote a just economy in the region.</p>
<p>According to the report&#8217;s findings, many service roles in Silicon Valley are typically contracted out, a practice that Benner and Neering argue contributes to the area&#8217;s growing income disparity.</p>
<p>&#8220;While prominent Silicon Valley companies are experiencing record revenues and profits, and wages of their direct employees are generally above average, many contract employees are excluded from these benefits,&#8221; Benner and Neering say.</p>
<p><strong>Racial disparity</strong></p>
<p>For example, the researchers found that contracted laborers are disproportionately African American or Latino. On average, they earn 70 percent of what comparable directly hired employees of high-tech firms earn. One in three fall below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level ($24,300 for 2016). &#160;Despite a 39-hour workweek, one in 10 blue collar workers relies on food stamps.</p>
<p>One of the more disturbing findings Benner and Neering discovered was the resulting consequences of being unable to afford housing.</p>
<p>Benner predicts as many as 78,000 people are in positions indirectly impacted by the contracting practice of high-tech firms. An estimated 19,000-39,000 are in low- and medium-wage occupations, more when outsourced white-collar jobs, such as sales representatives, couriers and messengers, software developers and computer programmers, are accounted for.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than one in six spend more than half of their total income on housing, leaving little left for other basic necessities in life,&#8221; Benner and Neering report. Twenty-two percent live with other families, and 36 percent live with extended families spanning three generations.</p>
<p><strong>Worse economic conditions</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What is clear from this research is that the contract workforce is a substantial portion of the region&#8217;s labor market, and the worse employment and economic conditions they face should clearly be of broad concern,&#8221; Benner and Neering conclude.</p>
<p>The report grows out of Benner&#8217;s research focus on the relationships between technological change, regional development, and structures of economic opportunity. He recently co-wrote <em>Equity, Growth and Community</em> with Manuel Pastor, a UC Santa Cruz alumnus and professor now at the University of Southern California. The book examines nearly 200 U.S. metropolitan regions to better understand what makes a city economically sustainable.</p>
<p>The study of contract workers was conducted in partnership with the Everett Program, a research center on campus dedicated to building social innovation through technology. Research was funded with a grant from the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UC Berkeley.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.everettprogram.org/main/wp-content/uploads/Contract-Workforce-Assessment.pdf</url><title>Silicon

href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> and the <a href="http://education.ucsc.edu/">Department of Education</a> rank among the nation's top programs in a survey by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>U.S. News</em> 2017 <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools">Best Graduate Schools</a> guide evaluates graduate schools for business, education, engineering, law, medicine, and nursing, and specialties within each area. In each discipline, all or nearly all UC graduate schools were ranked. This year's lists place the Baskin School of Engineering at 87th among engineering schools and the UCSC Education Department at 78th among education schools. UC Santa Cruz was also ranked 82nd among graduate programs in fine arts.</p>
<p>The annual Best Graduate Schools rankings are based on two types of data: expert opinions about program excellence and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school's faculty, research output, and student achievement.</p>

<p>The True Originals talks will be a highlight of <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html#!">Alumni Weekend</a>, which runs from April 28&#8211;May 1.</p>
<p>The renowned coffee impresario and Blue Bottle Coffee founder James Freeman (Stevenson '90, philosophy) will sit down for a one-on-one interview with UC Santa Cruz Philosophy Department Chair Daniel Guevara at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 30, at Oakes College.</p>
<p>And, in case you&#8217;re wondering what philosophy has to do with Freeman&#8217;s inspiration and career success, the answer is: everything.</p>
<p>At 11:15 a.m. at the same venue, following the Freeman-Guevara talk, edgy computer game designers <a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2016/03/maybe-they-wont-kill-you/">Akira Thompson</a> (M.S. &#8217;15, games and playable media) and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/02/lauren-scott-computer-game-design-ucsc.html">Lauren Scott</a> (Porter &#8216;14, business management economics/computer science) will talk about making their marks in the gaming world by staying true to their creative vision and their social consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Grounds for inspiration</strong></p>
<p>Blue Bottle started in 2002 as a one-man operation. Freeman was so strapped for funds that he paid the designer of the famous Blue Bottle logo in coffee beans.&#160; At a time when coffee was largely considered, in his own words, a &#8220;mechanism to stay awake,&#8221; he had a bold, exacting approach to specialty coffee making that has won him legions of fans worldwide.</p>
<p>But his beginnings were humble to say the least. Just to get the business off the ground, Freeman took a risk and kicked in $20,000 in savings, draining his bank account, and added additional funds from his credit cards. In all, he was in for $40,000. If he&#8217;d thought too much about what he was doing, perhaps he would have scratched the entire plan before Blue Bottle had a chance to take shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was unhampered by knowledge of business,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;I thought I could do it, so I did it. Somehow, the more you know, the more risk avoidant you become, (and) the more knowledge weighs you down.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>Aside from his beginner&#8217;s mind regarding business practices, Freeman had a bedrock of idealism, which comes from his experience as a philosophy major at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time, the philosophy department didn&#8217;t even have a graduate degree,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;After the Intro class, basically everything was taught by full professors, and most of the classes were seminar style. There was a real purity to studying this way, the clarity of expression that was expected. I learned a lot about writing, learned a lot about language. That was very inspiring to me. I still think about those days sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue Bottle now has 25 stores, including three in Tokyo, and more than 600 employees.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Changing the world, one game at a time</strong></p>
<p>Akira Thompson recently remarked about the &#8220;particular ability&#8221; of games to foster &#8220;empathetic experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of his recent games take on subjects including racism and greed. &#8220;We create a virtual space which is safer than the real world but is a place where you can explore from a perspective that you couldn&#8217;t before and see things first hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thompson, an Iraq veteran, has packed in a lot of living, thinking, and designing for someone in his early 30s. He has already made an appearance on the <em>Forbes</em> list of &#8220;30 under 30.&#8221;&#160; He is at the helm of his own independent game company. And Thompson has been drawing a lot of attention for &amp;maybetheywontkillyou, a live game in which the player takes on the role of a poor black American attempting to go to the corner store down the street and return home safely.</p>
<p>He founded the social art creative firm RainBros, which developed a game with socio-political overtones called Stop! Thief!</p>
<p>Lauren Scott, who will appear alongside Thompson, is part of the new wave of button-pushing female video game designers. After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, she went to work at Zynga as an associate game designer. After a year there, she went to work at Hangar 13, a 2K Games studio, where she is working on <em>Mafia 3</em>, a &#8220;third-person shooter&#8221; game with an organized crime theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by systems and by the way games can tell stories,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;You can abstract out a lot of really complex ideas and thoughts and experience them first hand in ways that would be impossible in any other medium. That is the main thing that draws me to game design.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Scott, her UC Santa Cruz years were a time for the students &#8220;to always be inquisitive, and always pushing boundaries, pushing the medium to its limits to see what it could explore and express.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0007462a8072701713dacb1306b76896"><name>food-security</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Food bank honors campus work in food security</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz received two awards from Second Harvest Food Bank</summary><keywords>food security, food bank, awards</keywords><start-date>1457683200000</start-date><display-name>Food security</display-name><path>/2016/03/food-security</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/food-security</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1468879290551</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1468879290551</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz was honored with two awards from Second Harvest Food Bank.</p>

<p>It will be a challenge to find room for these students--and I mean "find room" literally. Our challenge is that students are living in triples, lounges have been converted to living spaces, buses are full, and classrooms, libraries, and labs are at capacity.</p>
<p>Even though it's going to be tough, I am committed to accommodating these students and dedicating resources to ease the crunch. Here's why.</p>
<p>Responding to unprecedented demand for a UC education, the state legislature called upon UC in its budget to enroll an additional 5,000 California undergraduates--and committed to fund half the cost. The university is an independent institution, so legislators can't mandate what we do, but UC President Janet Napolitano agreed to the enrollment bump--and stepped up with additional funding for these new students.</p>
<p>The spirit of collaboration behind this enrollment increase aligns perfectly with the university's time-honored mission of serving the state and providing opportunity. I'm a firm believer in that mission; every single current UC student is benefiting from it, and I want to keep the doors open. The ripple effects are tangible to thousands of UC alumni, and to society as a whole.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is enrolling more first-generation college students, more low-income students, and a more diverse student body than ever in our history. A UC degree is a powerful engine of social mobility, and I want UCSC to do our part in providing such opportunities for qualified applicants.</p>
<p>We'll get through this pinch with resources dedicated to our student success initiatives, and with some help from the state and the Office of the President. We are poised to hire at least 18 new faculty, fund an additional 275 courses and sections, boost the number of teaching assistants, and support the college core courses. We also plan to enroll more doctoral students, invest in the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning, and upgrade classrooms and instructional equipment.</p>
<p>These investments will go a long way toward preserving the unique undergraduate experience at UC Santa Cruz. But we need to simultaneously think longer term, particularly in light of UC's commitment to enroll yet an additional 5,000 more California undergraduates by 2018-19.</p>
<p>We are already laying the groundwork to add nearly 1,000 new bed spaces in the next eight years or so, and we are working more broadly at the systemwide level to find new ways to finance construction and expand the pool of student housing.</p>
<p>We will be pressed to meet the challenges that come with enrollment growth, but again, the vision is laudable. Our students work hard to get here. When they are admitted to UCSC, they join an elite group of the best academically prepared high school graduates and transfer students in the state. They deserve the opportunities we offer.</p>
<p>That's why I'm going to continue to champion the needs of our students, working with campus leaders and staff to plan for the housing, classrooms, study spaces, and extracurricular facilities our students need. Next week I'll be meeting with lawmakers in Sacramento to make the case for the funding our students deserve.</p>
<p>We must prepare for slow, steady, responsible growth to accommodate the state's population. We must work together to remind legislators--and all Californians--that high-quality public higher education is a worthwhile investment. We must spell out the financial support that will be necessary to pay for increased access. And then we must join forces to secure the resources that will preserve access and quality for students today--and tomorrow.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>The Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81898f99807270177653ce7843d6cf5a"><name>fritz-chesnut-creates-stunning-visual-art</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alum Fritz Chesnut Creates Stunning Visual Art on Every Canvas</title><summary>Visual artist and UC Santa Cruz alum (Porter 1995) Fritz Chesnut was exposed at an early age to art, especially since his mother earned her PhD in art education and his father, who has a Master’s in German, also studied music.</summary><start-date>1459443600000</start-date><display-name>Alum Fritz Chesnut Creates Stunning Visual Art on Every Canvas</display-name><path>/2016/03/fritz-chesnut-creates-stunning-visual-art</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/fritz-chesnut-creates-stunning-visual-art</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1535476600683</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535478274049</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Maureen Dixon Harrison</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/fritz-chesnut.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/fritz-chesnut.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fritz-chesnut.jpg</name><display-name>fritz-chesnut.jpg</display-name><file-size>62614</file-size><width>400</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Fritz Chesnut</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/fritz-chesnut-crop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/fritz-chesnut-crop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fritz-chesnut-crop.jpg</name><display-name>fritz-chesnut-crop.jpg</display-name><file-size>16860</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Fritz Chesnut</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Visual artist and UC Santa Cruz alum (Porter 1995)&#160;<strong>Fritz Chesnut</strong>&#160;was exposed at an early age to art, especially since his mother earned her PhD in art education and his father, who has a Master&#8217;s in German, also studied music. They both attended UC Santa Barbara, where Fritz grew up, and his dad worked at the university as a computer programmer. &#8220;I was exposed to art through books and going to see art in museums,&#8221; says Fritz. &#8220;And both of my parents were very supportive of me wanting to study art and become an artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a child, Fritz found himself gravitating towards painting and drawing, copying&#160;<em>Mad Magazine</em> illustrations, comic book characters and spending his time in his own fantasy world that he created through his artwork. By the time he was in high school and was deciding on where to attend college, his parents suggested UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I remember visiting Porter College in high school and walking through the quad, and it looked like that&#8217;s where all of the cool, punk rock weirdoes were!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fritz majored in studio art and, as a freshman, wanted to move ahead and take the intermediate and advanced painting classes. &#8220;I had an amazing time there, met a lot of great people and am still in touch with a handful of artists who were students at Porter when I was there. I also remember streaking through College Eight one night with a bunch of guys!&#8221; Good times.</p>
<p>One of his favorite teachers was&#160;<strong>Alan Firestone</strong>, who was a visiting art professor at the time. Fritz took Firestone&#8217;s 3D mixed media class and remembers his fellow classmates making incredible work in the class that &#8220;blew me away&#8221;. "Alan was very down-to-earth, super supportive and we had some great discussions in that class,&#8221; says Fritz. Another teacher who influenced him was&#160;<strong>Elizabeth Stephens</strong>, who taught welding then. &#8220;Elizabeth turned us on to a more theoretical approach that inspired me. She&#8217;s from a performance background and that was all new to me. I remember learning about&#160;<strong>Chris Burden&#160;</strong>[performance, sculpture and installation artist] through her, and his work at the time was endlessly inspiring.&#8221; After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, Fritz went on to earn his MFA at Rutgers University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fritz was a brilliant live-wire and brought a lot of creative energy to my classes,&#8221; says Elizabeth Stephens. &#8220;I loved his spirit and the work that he made so much, that I encouraged him to go to my alma mater, Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers, which he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>After grad school, in the late 1990s, Fritz&#8217;s work began being shown in artist-initiated galleries in New York City, and as he persevered with his work, he had more shows in more established galleries, including the Bellwether Gallery. Since moving to Los Angeles in 2008, he&#8217;s had solo shows at Country Club (both in LA and Cincinnati), and at CULT/Aimee Friberg Exhibitions in San Francisco. &#8220;My show in 2010 with Country Club in Los Angeles was at one of&#160;<strong>Rudolph Schindler</strong>&#8217;s&#160;houses called Buck House,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That show was amazing. I&#8217;ve never done a show where I thought so much about where everything would be hung. The house was like a perfect fit for my work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fritz prefers working primarily with paint and his art is inspired by a plethora of fascinating objects and influences, including geological formations, punk rock, surfing, abandoned buildings and ruins, mudslides, satellite photos and earth art. He became well known initially for a dynamic series of photo-realist paintings depicting crowd scenes and performers that address fandom and idol worship.</p>
<p>His work as been described as &#8220;employ[ing] an intuitive process that allows for an interaction of paint based on subtle shifts in viscosity and accumulation. Chestnut's work filters the history of 20th century abstraction (Louis, Frankenthaler, Rothko) through an immersive lens of psychedelic Southern California surf culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always attempting to make work that feels grown, or comes about through some process that includes time, gravity, temperature and color,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;I go through a process with my work, too, where each painting that came before directly informs the next one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He advises budding artists to just focus on learning and figuring out who they are, but to be open to making mistakes and failing. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see when you&#8217;re 20 years old, but there&#8217;s so much more maturing to be done before exhibiting and getting paid. The professional side of being an artist isn&#8217;t taught in college and for a reason I think, because those two concepts are pretty opposed to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now married with two children of his own, daughter Stella age 10 and son Nolan almost 12, Fritz says he and his family really enjoy being together, especially family poker games. &#8220;I like dragging them all to the beach, too.&#8221; Coming from such a creative family, it&#8217;s no surprise that his daughter also loves singing, acting and musical theater, and his son loves to perform.</p>
<p>Since meeting his wife, actress and comedian&#160;<strong>Molly Shannon</strong>&#160;(<em>Saturday Night Live</em>&#160;and numerous successful films), 15 years ago on a blind date, he finds that sometimes their work intersects when they attend museum galas together. His art can also be seen in the background of Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s film <em>The Girlfriend Experience</em>. Referring to his wife, he says, &#8220;Our work is so different that we seldom directly inspire each other, but I&#8217;ll read her scripts sometimes and have pretty strong opinions!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, Fritz is working on a new series of paintings using screens and stencils, spraying enamel paint onto wet acrylic paint that look like deformed patterns. He advises art students to get a well-rounded education, which is why he chose UC Santa Cruz over a more traditional, art-focused school. &#8220;I got into the San Francisco Art Institute, and when I went to visit, SFAI told me I should go to UC Santa Cruz if I got in there. I think that swayed my decision!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fritz also hopes to visit the UC Santa Cruz campus in the near future and looks forward to reconnecting with many of the faculty, as well as meeting the students and staff, and planning some inspiring arts events together.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81ab162a807270177653ce78d78eed9d"><name>anne-flett-giordano-extraordinary-writing-career</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Anne Flett-Giordano Credits her Extraordinary Writing Career to One Crazy Night at Porter College</title><summary>Growing up in Danville, California, Emmy Award-winning comedy screenplay writer and UC Santa Cruz, Porter College alum Anne Flett-Giordano got an early start on how to tell enthralling stories.</summary><start-date>1458752400000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Anne Flett-Giordano Credits her Extraordinary Writing Career to One Crazy Night at Porter College</display-name><path>/2016/03/anne-flett-giordano-extraordinary-writing-career</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/anne-flett-giordano-extraordinary-writing-career</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1535478797837</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535480949574</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Maureen Dixon Harrison</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/anne-flett-giordano.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/anne-flett-giordano.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>anne-flett-giordano.jpg</name><display-name>anne-flett-giordano.jpg</display-name><file-size>64037</file-size><width>400</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Anne Flett-Giordano</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/anne-flett-giordano-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/anne-flett-giordano-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>anne-flett-giordano-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>anne-flett-giordano-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16740</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Anne Flett-Giordano</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Growing up in Danville, California, Emmy Award-winning comedy screenplay writer and UC Santa Cruz, Porter College alum&#160;<strong>Anne Flett-Giordano</strong>&#160;got an early start on how to tell enthralling stories. Instead of the usual bedtime reading routine, her grandfather made up intriguing yarns about a deer called Twinkle Toes, inspiring the young Anne to make up her own Twinkle Toes adventures that took on a much more dramatic and thrilling spin. &#8220;Realizing I could terrify my brother and sisters with tales of forest mayhem is probably what kindled my desire to become a writer,&#8221; she says. That burgeoning talent eventually led her to becoming an extremely successful, multiple-award winning screenplay writer for several hit television shows including&#160;<em>Frasier</em>,&#160;<em>Desperate Housewives</em>,&#160;<em>Becker</em>,&#160;<em>Kate &amp; Allie</em>, and&#160;<em>Hot in Cleveland</em>.</p>
<p>Attending UC Santa Cruz turned out to be a very auspicious decision, as it became the start of Anne&#8217;s journey to realizing her dream of becoming a screenwriter. She had a double major in psychology and theater arts. &#8220;A knowledge of both, in my opinion, is a must for any aspiring writer,&#8221; she says. It&#8217;s also where she met her future writing partner, and together they decided that they would take the plunge after graduating and move to Los Angeles to see if they could make it in the film and TV industry. &#8220;At an art opening in College V (as it was known in those wild and lawless days), I stole a bottle of cheap red wine with fellow student,&#160;<strong>Chuck Ranberg</strong>,&#8221; she recalls. &#8220;We took it up to his dorm room and drank and talked all night about how much we wanted to be screenwriters. I don&#8217;t know why we decided to try writing together&#8230;we were wicked drunk and massively sick the next day. But when we sobered up, we gave it a shot. We wrote my senior thesis, a rollicking tale of Wall Street malfeasance called &#8216;Crash&#8217;, and a 40-year partnership was born.&#8221;</p>
<p>She credits film professor&#160;<strong>Eli Hollander</strong>&#160;with giving she and Ranberg the encouragement they needed and fueling their belief that they really could set the screenwriting world on fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as we realized we identified more with Buddy and Sally on the old&#160;<em>Dick Van Dyke Show</em>&#160;than with Rob and Laura I think the die was cast,&#8221; says Ranberg. &#8220;We made each other laugh and had the same sensibilities, so it seemed a natural to try writing something as a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those first few years we really only had each other, and I think those shared adventures were enough to bind us together for the long run. Over the years when things get crazy behind the scenes it&#8217;s invaluable to have that other person meet your eyes across the room to say, &#8216;Yes, this really is as bizarre as you think it is.&#8217; And then you get to laugh&#160;about it later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leading up to landing at UC Santa Cruz, Anne says that as a child she studied Looney Tunes cartoons &#8220;like a Talmudic scholar.&#8221; She still treasures a picture of Daffy Duck that the legendary animator Chuck Jones drew for her after guest lecturing at a UC Santa Cruz animation class. Other early influences included being introduced by her sixth grade teacher to Eric Clapton and Cream&#8217;s&#160;<em>Tales of Brave Ulysses</em>, which inspired her to write tragedies for the more outgoing classmates to perform. &#8220;The worst divas I&#8217;ve ever had to work with, as sixth grade boys loathe taking direction and love to ad lib.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another turning point was in eighth grade when she was grounded for six months, forcing her to find interesting ways to spend her time, other than getting into trouble. Very fortunately, she discovered the works of Balzac, Kirk Vonnegut and Henry James during that time and learned a lot about great story structure in the process.</p>
<p>After graduating in three years, she travelled through Europe to visit friends, and just happened to be at Elstree Studios in London when a young, unknown geeky guy named George Lucas was directing an independent film about people in space that the studio was convinced would be a huge flop &#8211; called&#160;<em>Star Wars</em>. &#8220;Everyone on the lot eyed all of the weird space shit going by like it was nuts,&#8221; says Anne. &#8220;It seemed like such a silly movie. I never even bothered visiting the set. I am an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also hung out for a few days with none other than Paul McCartney who was also at Elstree at the time. &#8220;I was 19, just out of college, and I met [Moody Blues and Wings&#8217; guitarist] Denny Laine in a pub. He invited me to the sound stage where he and Paul McCartney were rehearsing their&#160;<em>Wings Over America</em>&#160;tour.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, it was time to make good on her goal to go to Los Angeles and pursue her dream. Ranberg joined her a year later. &#8220;We both had a series of insane jobs in the &#8216;industry&#8217; to pay our cheap rents,&#8221; says Anne. &#8220;My favorite was when I was a beach extra on a Roger Corman movie called&#160;<em>Thunder and Lightening</em>&#160;starring David Carradine and Kate Jackson. I was lying in the sand when I heard the director and the production manager discussing whether to use me or a dummy to do Kate&#8217;s stunts. Since I could actually wave my arms and legs, they eventually chose me. I was in various car chase scenes, culminating in our driving through a store front, plate glass window. In spite of the seat belt, my head hit the windshield. The production people offered me a beer and Qualudes for the pain. No Union on low-budget sets!&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting involved with the now legendary B-movie director was another auspicious move for Anne, since it was through Corman that Anne met directors Ron Howard and Joe Dante. They were both just getting their start as directors then, as so many now very famous, actors and directors had done, intentionally wanting to work for Corman to gain valuable experience.</p>
<p>She and Ranberg also were secretaries at Lorimar Television on the former MGM lot (now Sony) for the hit primetime TV soap operas&#160;<em>Dallas</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Knots Landing</em>. Like something out of one of their own comedy scripts, they both would sign up for the weekend work list when they knew the studio was hosting a big party. The studio guards would let them in the morning to work, then they&#8217;d stay after hours, write spec scripts together until the party started, then get ready to surreptitiously crash the party. &#8220;Chuck had a thrift store tux and I had a cheap evening gown. We&#8217;d put them on and just walk into these elegant galas liked we belonged. Cary Grant, Ava Gardner, Peter O&#8217;Toole, Bob Evans, the King of Spain, the Israeli Olympic team&#8230;we met everybody, and scored a ton of free shrimp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Filling every spare minute by diligently writing spec scripts, they eventually got the attention of comedy producer Bob Ellison, who had written for&#160;<em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>, among others. Or as Anne describes, &#8220;he took pity on us&#8221;. &#8220;He saw me working on a script at my desk and asked what it was. It was a spec for a show being shot in New York called&#160;<em>Kate &amp; Allie</em>. Bob knew the producer, so he sent him our script.&#8221; The producer liked the script so much that he called her back and suggested that she write another one. A few weeks later, she and Ranberg found themselves in Manhattan working as bona fide, professional TV writers.</p>
<p>Through the years, their outstanding talent lead them to create some of TV&#8217;s most memorable classic comedies. Of all the series she&#8217;s worked on, Anne doesn&#8217;t have a favorite since they&#8217;ve all turned out to be very positive experiences. &#8220;I&#8217;m so incredibly lucky to get paid to hang out with really smart people who make each other laugh all day. It&#8217;s pretty hard not to love them all.&#8221; She has many amusing stories, including one about actress Betty White (<em>Hot in Cleveland</em>) feeding marshmallows to a bear out of her mouth and inviting them to pet tigers in her dressing room. &#8220;She&#8217;s as nice as she seems and great role model for growing older with style.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recounting her time on&#160;<em>Desperate Housewives</em>, Anne says that the series had &#8220;a bunch of crazy bitches &#8211; I mean eccentric personalities &#8211; both male and female, in front of and behind the cameras. But most of those stories have been covered in law suits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having won five primetime Emmys, Anne says her most treasured win was her first for&#160;<em>Frasier</em>. &#8220;It was the best because, unlike sex, your first is always the best, and because our presenters were Carl Reiner (my idol) and Cindy Lauper, who Chuck and I both love, but who chastised Chuck as were being played off stage for not having her latest CD.&#8221; Her most memorable award night was when she won her first People&#8217;s Choice award because she walked off of the stage in the wrong direction, and right into the arms of Aerosmith bad boys Steven Tyler and Joe Perry.</p>
<p>When asked to give advice to aspiring writers, she states that empathy, story sense and timing are key. She suggests that anyone who wants to work creatively should consider powering down periodically and be willing to think without any outside distractions. &#8220;Don&#8217;t fear the silence,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Hanging in college dorm rooms with no computers, cell phones, TV, etc., forced us to make our own laughs, and that was the best comedy writing ever! Not that I could live without those things now, but I think Mozart could hear his own music in his head because it wasn&#8217;t being drowned out by Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Anne is enjoying her newest adventure of having her first novel published, a mystery called <em>Marry, Kiss, Kill</em>. It has already reached number 11 on the Los Angeles Times Best Seller list and been nominated for best mystery by the Southern California Independent Booksellers Awards. She likes to peruse reader comments about her book on Amazon &#8220;like a maniac&#8221; and says that writing a book can be quite lonely. She&#8217;s grateful she could use the names of all the people she&#8217;s still friends with from UC Santa Cruz in her book, which made the process much more enjoyable. &#8220;It was like they were all there with me, laughing and being 17 again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She now enjoys living between her apartment in Westwood and her home in Santa Barbara that she shares with her husband, Arnie (who she met when he was a cameraman on&#160;<em>Kate &amp; Allie</em>) and their cats. Her pastimes include doing a lot of reading and travelling, plus Pilates, swimming and kayaking.</p>
<p>Anne still has family in Santa Cruz, so she and Arnie visit regularly during the holidays, and since Arnie is an avid disc golf player, they run into a lot of UC Santa Cruz students at the DeLaveaga course.</p>
<p>Of her amazing career and remarkable life, Anne says, &#8220;I shudder what my life had been if not for a stolen bottle of art wine!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d2a19c5c8072701764c820a65cd825e5"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2016/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/03/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1459527720002</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477419626079</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
