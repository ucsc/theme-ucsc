Only 7.2 light-years from Earth, it is the coldest known object outside of our solar system and is just barely visible at infrared wavelengths with the largest ground-based telescopes.</p>
<p>Now, a team led by astronomers at UC Santa Cruz has succeeded in obtaining an infrared spectrum of WISE 0855 using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, providing the first details of the object's composition and chemistry. Among the findings is strong evidence for the existence of clouds of water or water ice, the first such clouds detected outside of our solar system.</p>
<p>"We would expect an object that cold to have water clouds, and this is the best evidence that it does," said Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Skemer is first author of a paper on the new findings to be published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04902">currently available online</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Failed star</strong></p>
<p>A brown dwarf is essentially a failed star, having formed the way stars do through the gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas and dust, but without gaining enough mass to spark the nuclear fusion reactions that make stars shine. With about five times the mass of Jupiter, WISE 0855 resembles that gas giant planet in many respects. Its temperature is about 250 Kelvin, or minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit, making it nearly as cold as Jupiter, which is 130 Kelvin.</p>
<p>"WISE 0855 is our first opportunity to study an extrasolar planetary-mass object that is nearly as cold as our own gas giants," Skemer said.</p>
<p>Previous observations of the brown dwarf, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/793/1/L16/meta">published in 2014</a>, provided tentative indications of water clouds based on very limited photometric data. Skemer, a coauthor of the earlier paper, said obtaining a spectrum (which separates the light from an object into its component wavelengths) is the only way to detect an object's molecular composition.</p>
<p>WISE 0855 is too faint for conventional spectroscopy at optical or near-infrared wavelengths, but thermal emission from the deep atmosphere at wavelengths in a narrow window around 5 microns offered an opportunity where spectroscopy would be "challenging but not impossible," he said.</p>
<p>The team used the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii and the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph to observe WISE 0855 over 13 nights for a total of about 14 hours.</p>
<p>"It's five times fainter than any other object detected with ground-based spectroscopy at this wavelength," Skemer said. "Now that we have a spectrum, we can really start thinking about what's going on in this object. Our spectrum shows that WISE 0855 is dominated by water vapor and clouds, with an overall appearance that is strikingly similar to Jupiter."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Cloudy atmosphere</strong></p>
<p>The researchers developed atmospheric models of the equilibrium chemistry for a brown dwarf at 250 Kelvin and calculated the resulting spectra under different assumptions, including cloudy and cloud-free models. The models predicted a spectrum dominated by features resulting from water vapor, and the cloudy model yielded the best fit to the features in the spectrum of WISE 0855.</p>
<p>Comparing the brown dwarf to Jupiter, the team found that their spectra are strikingly similar with respect to water absorption features. One significant difference is the abundance of phosphine in Jupiter's atmosphere. Phosphine forms in the hot interior of the planet and reacts to form other compounds in the cooler outer atmosphere, so its appearance in the spectrum is evidence of turbulent mixing in Jupiter's atmosphere. The absence of a strong phosphine signal in the spectrum of WISE 0855 implies that it has a less turbulent atmosphere.</p>
<p>"The spectrum allows us to investigate dynamical and chemical properties that have long been studied in Jupiter's atmosphere, but this time on an extrasolar world," Skemer said.</p>

<p>The awards committee said Zavella&#8217;s career accomplishments advancing the status of women, and especially Latina and Chicana women have been exceptional. Her scholarship, teaching, advocacy, and mentorship have made critical contributions to understanding how gender, race, nation, and class intersect in specific contexts, the committee&#8217;s chair wrote in notifying Zavella of the award last week. &#160;</p>
<p>The award will be presented at the American Anthropological Association&#8217;s 115th annual meeting in Minneapolis in November.</p>
<p>Three colleagues from other universities nominated Zavella. One wrote: &#8220;Pat has been engaged in path-breaking research on Chicano/Latino women, first on working class women cannery workers, and later on electronics and apparel employees, transnational Mexican/US migrants, and activists engaged in the struggle for reproductive justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said that Zavella &#8220;has had a prolific and sustained academic career devoted to the study of women&#8217;s work, gender discrimination and inequalities based on sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavella joined UC Santa Cruz in 1984 and served as chair of the Latin America and Latino studies department from 2007-2011 and again from 2014 until June 30, 2016. She also previously served as director of the Chicano/Latino Research Center.</p>
<p>She was a co-winner of the 2010 Prize for Distinguished Achievement in the Critical Study of North America given by the Society for the Anthropology of North America. In 2008, her UCSC colleagues chose her to deliver the Faculty Research Lecture.</p>
<p>She received her undergraduate degree from Pitzer College, and her masters and Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. She had a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford's Center for Chicano Research before joining the UCSC faculty.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c1277d388072701713dacb13da7d2896"><name>blob-and-elnino</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>‘The Blob’ overshadows El Niño</title><summary>The Blob and El Niño are on their way out, leaving behind a disrupted marine ecosystem along the West Coast.</summary><keywords>Michael Jacox, The Blob, El Nino, toxic algae bloom</keywords><start-date>1467824400000</start-date><display-name>‘The Blob’ overshadows El Niño</display-name><path>/2016/07/blob-and-elnino</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/blob-and-elnino</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1467824437153</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1467827840135</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Michael Milstein, NOAA Fisheries</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/elnino-blob-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/elnino-blob-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elnino-blob-425.jpg</name><display-name>elnino-blob-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>91766</file-size><width>425</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt>cartoon of the blob and el nino</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/elnino-blob-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/elnino-blob-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elnino-blob-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>elnino-blob-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18391</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cartoon of the blob and el nino</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Blob and El Ni&#241;o are on their way out, leaving a disrupted marine ecosystem behind.

In 1997-98 warming was strongest near the coast, consistent with effects of El Ni&#241;o. In 2015-16, warming was more uniform and widespread, consistent with pre-existing warming known as &#8216;the Blob.&#8217; (</span><span>Credit: Michael Jacox)</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>El Ni&#241;o exerted powerful effects around the globe in the last year: eroding California beaches; driving drought in northern South America, Africa and Asia; and bringing record rain to the U.S. Pacific Northwest and southern South America. In the Pacific Ocean off the West Coast, however, the California Current Ecosystem was already unsettled by an unusual pattern of warming popularly known as &#8220;the Blob.&#8221;</p>
<p>New research based on ocean models and near real-time data from autonomous gliders indicates that the Blob and El Ni&#241;o together strongly depressed productivity off the West Coast, with the Blob driving most of the impact.</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069716/full">The research</a>&#160;published in the American Geophysical Union journal&#160;<em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>&#160;by scientists from UC Santa Cruz, NOAA Fisheries, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography is among the first to assess the marine effects of the 2015-2016 El Ni&#241;o off the West Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year there was a lot of speculation about the consequences of &#8216;the Blob&#8217; and El Ni&#241;o battling it out off the U.S. West Coast,&#8221; said lead author Michael Jacox, a project scientist at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries&#8217; Southwest Fisheries Science Center. &#8220;We found that off California El Ni&#241;o turned out to be much weaker than expected. The Blob continued to be a dominant force, and the two of them together had strongly negative impacts on marine productivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, both the Blob and El Ni&#241;o are on their way out, but in their wake lies a heavily disrupted ecosystem,&#8221; Jacox said.</p>
<p><strong>Warm conditions</strong></p>
<p>Unusually warm ocean temperatures that became known as the Blob began affecting waters off the West Coast in late 2013. Warm conditions &#8211; whether driven by the Blob or El Ni&#241;o &#8211; slow the flow of nutrients from the deep ocean, reducing the productivity of coastal ecosystems. Temperatures close to 3 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) above average also led to sightings of warm-water species far to the north of their typical range and likely contributed to the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/hab-update.html">largest harmful algal bloom ever recorded</a> on the West Coast last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;These past years have been extremely unusual off the California coast, with humpback whales closer to shore, pelagic red crabs washing up on the beaches of central California, and sportfish in higher numbers in southern California,&#8221; said Elliott Hazen of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, a coauthor of the paper. &#8220;This paper reveals how broad scale warming influences the biology directly off our shores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research paper describes real-time monitoring of the California Current Ecosystem with the latest technology, including autonomous gliders that track undersea conditions along the West Coast. &#8220;This work reflects technological advances that now let us rapidly assess the effects of major climate disruptions and project their impacts on the ecosystem,&#8221; Jacox said.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Separate but related&#160;<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep27612">research recently published in Scientific Reports</a>&#160;identifies the optimal conditions for productivity in the California Current off the West Coast, which will help assess the future effects of climate change or climate variability such as El Ni&#241;o. The research was authored by the same scientists at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind has a &#8216;goldilocks effect&#8217; on productivity in the California Current,&#8221; Hazen said. &#8220;If wind is too weak, nutrients limit productivity, and if wind is too strong, productivity is moved offshore or lost to the deep ocean. Understanding how wind and nutrients drive productivity provides context for events like the Blob and El Ni&#241;o, so we can better understand how the ecosystem is likely to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both papers emphasize the importance of closely monitoring West Coast marine ecosystems for the impacts of a changing climate. Although the tropical signals of El Ni&#241;o were strong, the drivers &#8211; called &#8220;teleconnections&#8221; &#8211; that usually carry the El Ni&#241;o pattern from the tropics to the West Coast were not as effective as in previous strong El Ni&#241;os.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all El Ni&#241;os evolve in the same way in the tropics, nor are their impacts the same off our coast,&#8221; said Steven Bograd, a research scientist at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center and coauthor of both papers. &#8220;Local conditions, in this case from the Blob, can modulate the way our ecosystem responds to these large scale climate events.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Jacox, Hazen, and Bograd, the coauthors of the paper include Christopher Edwards and Andrew Moore in the UC Santa Cruz Department of Ocean Sciences, and Katherine Zaba and Daniel Rudnick at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://reports.news.ucsc.edu/west-coast/</url><title>Special Report: The Wild, Wild West Coast</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/hab-update.html</url><title>Record-setting toxic algae bloom persists along U.S. West Coast</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c15dba008072701713dacb13552f3886"><name>fall-admissions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz increases admissions offers for Californians</title><summary>The campus accepted nearly 4,728 more California high school students than last year—a 27 percent increase—and also marked gains in the numbers of African American, Asian American, and Chicano/Latino students admitted.&#13;

<p>The campus accepted nearly 4,728 more California high school students than last year&#8212;a 27 percent increase&#8212;and also marked gains in the numbers of African American, Asian American, and Chicano/Latino students admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a very good year for many of our state students, both first-year students and those transferring from a California community college,&#8221; said Michael McCawley, director of Admissions. &#8220;Increasing access and opportunity at our campus is being realized by hundreds more Californians than last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus is aiming to enroll 4,305 freshmen with 3,805 coming from California, and 1,144 transfer students with 1,094 coming from California. The anticipated freshmen enrollment represents 650 more than last fall. UC Santa Cruz expects to also enroll 100 California transfers beginning winter quarter. New this year, the campus is currently accepting transfer applications for students who wish to begin their studies in winter quarter, which starts in January.</p>
<p>California students are by far the largest portion of the 2016 freshman class. The campus expects to bring in fewer freshman from outside California than last year, though Chancellor George Blumenthal considers enrolling non-resident undergraduates to be an important goal for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;A UC Santa Cruz graduate should be prepared to compete in our global society, &#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;The educational experience is enriched when discussions and research projects are informed by students from other states and other countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus extended admissions offers to 2,732 freshmen from other states and 3,657 freshmen from outside the United States as part of its effort to enroll a class that encompasses ethnic as well as geographic diversity. Combined, freshman admissions offers totaled 28,705.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are already making preparations to welcome the new class into UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s distinctive residential colleges, Scholars Program, and new federally funded programs related to the campus&#8217;s Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) status, and ever-expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/data-reports/key-reports/student-workforce-data.html">Data released today</a> (July 6) by the University of California&#8217;s Office of the President show UC Santa Cruz extended admission offers to 5,421 more students than a year ago, a 23 percent increase. Smaller increases were seen for out-of-state students (232 more than the previous year) and international students (461 more).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our enrollment goals reflect our commitment to serve California and offer its high school students an education that pairs research opportunities with a residential experience like that of a small liberal arts college,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>The increase in offers comes as UC Santa Cruz also experienced a record number of applications&#8212;more than 49,000&#8212;for the 2016 freshman class. The overall freshman admit rate was 58 percent.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz also offered admission to 5,417 transfer students, a 15.6 percent increase over last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;These last few years demonstrate the increased interest in our campus from students throughout California, as well as from other states and other countries,&#8221; McCawley said. &#8220;I&#8217;m particularly pleased with the significant increase in African-American admits and American Indian admits, and hope more of these students enroll at UCSC in the fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz admitted the second highest number of California African-American students (825), representing a 58 percent increase. The campus also recorded the highest number of admitted American Indian students (165) among all the UC campuses. African American admits from out of state reached 194 this year, representing a 15.5 percent increase. Offers of admission to Hispanic/Latino students were at 5,567, a 25 percent increase.</p>
<p>Thirty-three percent of admitted California freshmen are considered first-generation, coming from households where neither parent has a four-year degree, and 28 percent are from low-income families.</p>
<p>The fall 2016 admitted class of California residents continues to be diverse, with 35 percent Asian American, 32 percent white/other, 25 percent Hispanic/Latino, 3.7 percent African American, 0.7 percent American Indian, and 0.3 percent Pacific Islander. An additional 3.6 percent of admitted students did not report their race/ethnicity. Campus leaders and admissions officers work tirelessly to ensure California high school students know that a UC education is accessible and affordable and that UC Santa Cruz is a campus known for its academic strength, access to faculty, high research impact, residential colleges, and its natural beauty and proximity to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>A Hispanic-Serving Institution since 2012, UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html">earned two federal grants</a> to increase achievement for Latinos and all students on campus, as well as partner with San Jose City College to help transfer students earn their bachelor&#8217;s degrees at a research university.</p>
<p>Additionally, UC Santa Cruz pledged its support for the Oakland Promise, which aims to make a college degree accessible to all students in Oakland. The initiative&#8217;s backers announced in January that they&#8217;d raised $25 million to help with the goal to triple the number of college graduates from Oakland within the next decade.</p>
<h3>Preparing for the increased enrollment</h3>
<p>With a boost in enrollment, UC Santa Cruz is busy preparing for the fall quarter. The campus is poised to hire at least 18 new ladder-rank faculty, fund an additional 275 courses and sections, boost the number of teaching assistants, and support the college core courses.</p>
<p>The campus is also planning to enroll more doctoral students, invest in the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning, and upgrade classrooms and instructional equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These investments will go a long way toward preserving the unique undergraduate experience at UC Santa Cruz that&#8217;s driven by our distinctive college system and the broad range of undergraduate research and experiential learning opportunities,&#8221; Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>For the coming fall, the campus housing office has increased the total number of beds to 9,300 by converting existing space into housing units. For fall 2017, campus leaders are exploring the feasibility of various options, including modular housing units.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7299cbc8072701713dacb134bc413b9"><name>fisher-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hydrogeologist Andrew Fisher honored by Geological Society of America</title><summary>Fisher's Recharge Initiative aims to replenish California's depleted groundwater supplies.</summary><keywords>Andrew Fisher, hydrogeology, Recharge Initiative, groundwater, California drought</keywords><start-date>1467874800000</start-date><display-name>Hydrogeologist Andrew Fisher honored by Geological Society of America</display-name><path>/2016/07/fisher-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/fisher-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1467925239445</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1468436477544</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/andy-fisher-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/andy-fisher-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>andy-fisher-400.jpg</name><display-name>andy-fisher-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>89886</file-size><width>400</width><height>275</height></image><image-alt>Andy Fisher with recharge pond in background</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/andy-fisher-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/andy-fisher-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>andy-fisher-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>andy-fisher-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17782</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Andy Fisher</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Andrew Fisher in California's Pajaro Valley describing a managed aquifer recharge project.

In recognition of his contributions, the <a href="http://www.geosociety.org/index.htm">Geological Society of America</a> (GSA) will award Fisher the 2016 O. E. Meinzer Award from the GSA's Hydrogeology Division.</p>
<p>The award's namesake, Oscar Edward Meinzer, served as chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's groundwater division for 34 years and has been called "the father of modern groundwater hydrology." Fisher will receive the award, recognizing his "distinguished body of work in the field of hydrogeology and, particularly, marine hydrogeology," at the annual meeting of the GSA in September.</p>
<p>In marine hydrogeology, Fisher has done pioneering research on how vast quantities of ocean water circulate through the seafloor, flowing through the volcanic rock of the upper oceanic crust. He has also spent decades studying groundwater in the Pajaro Valley, where saltwater intrusion due to overpumping of the aquifer is an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>The prolonged drought in California has added new urgency to Fisher's <a href="http://www.rechargeinitiative.org/">Recharge Initiative</a> aimed at replenishing groundwater supplies. He and his students have been designing and studying the performance of recharge ponds where managed runoff from storms can soak in and restore depleted aquifers.</p>
<p>Fisher is the UCSC campus lead for the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a> and coauthored a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/groundwater-report.html">recent report</a> on sustainable groundwater management.</p>
<p>"What is most interesting about Fisher's approach is how it couples scientific principles with what is possible in a complex and political world," said Leigh Bernacchi, coordinator of the UC Water program. "Through conscientious development of relationships among farming, management, and stakeholder communities, he has helped to create novel incentives for recharge, including a new program for net metering that will help to offset operational costs."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=21467</url><title>California

<p>Zhang will assume the post Aug. 22, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said. Zhang &#8220;brings a strong combination of international economic expertise, public sector policymaking, and diplomatic skills. He also has extensive experience with international financial institutions, excellent communication and negotiating skills, and a superb knowledge of IMF policies and procedures,&#8221; Lagarde said in a statement.</p>
<p>The IMF, based in Washington, D.C., is made up of 189 countries, working to foster global monetary cooperation. Its primary purpose is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system.</p>
<p><strong>Two UCSC grads on IMF board</strong></p>
<p>Zhang is no stranger to the IMF. He served on the organization&#8217;s executive board from September 2011 until early 2015. In 2014, he was one of two UC Santa Cruz international economics graduates among the 24 IMF executive directors. Zhang represented China. The other UCSC grad, Alvaro Rojas, who earned his Ph.D. in international economics in 2004, represented Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the honor of working with Tao Zhang at the IMF executive board, where I witnessed his thorough contributions to technical discussions as well has his diplomatic skills on making the views of China well known,&#8221; said Rojas, currently a senior external consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank. &#8220;As the representative of China, the second largest economy in the world, he was always well aware of the growing importance of representing the views of his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rojas credited UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate program for preparing students for top-level careers in international economics. &#8220;The fact that two UCSC graduates of the Ph.D. program in international economics coincided as executive directors is proof of the success the program had in terms of preparing its graduate students to assume the highest responsibilities representing our countries or regions at international organizations, such as the IMF,&#8221; Rojas said.</p>
<p><strong>Program's global reach</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It is also a proof of the global reach the Ph.D. program has had throughout the years, as we had the chance to study as foreign students from China and, in my case, from Chile. As a UCSC graduate, I will always feel part of the UCSC community.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Another UCSC international economics Ph.D. graduate, Andr&#233;a Maechler, who has also worked with the IMF, currently sits on the governing board of Switzerland&#8217;s national bank, the first woman to do so.</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s appointment was widely anticipated when he was named deputy governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China in May. Zhang becomes the second Chinese national to hold the deputy managing director&#8217;s post, following his predecessor Zhu Min, who steps down later this month. &#160;</p>
<p>Zhang received his Ph.D. degree in December 1995. His research focused on federalism in China, and his dissertation was titled &#8220;Fiscal Decentralization, Public Spending and Economic Growth: the Experience in the Post-Reform China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese media reported Zhang has been a strong force behind China's successful push to include the Chinese yuan in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights currency basket. Zhang is also known for helping China win a greater share of voting rights in the IMF.</p>
<p>Last year, Zhang helped write China's first-ever policy on regulating the online finance industry&#8211;a policy implemented last July by the central bank and nine other central government departments.

 <br/>
 The rules were simple&#8212;the selections had to be specific moments (not trends or broad social movements, or even necessarily a well-known date) and these moments had to have occurred sometime during the 20th century. <br/>
 <br/>
 <em>Time</em> has now published the results in a story titled <a href="http://time.com/4381471/july-4-moments-change-america/"><em><strong>25 Moments That Changed America</strong></em></a>, which includes short essays--based on interviews with each historian--explaining why their moment was selected.<br/>
 <br/>
 One of the distinguished historians that <em>Time</em> contacted for the piece is UC Santa Cruz humanities dean Tyler Stovall, who is also currently president-elect of the American Historical Association. <br/>
 <br/>
 Stovall chose for his moment: <em>Busing is Mandated in Boston (June 21, 1974)</em>. He said that he chose that moment because it seemed to mark a transition between the push for integration that accompanied the Civil Rights Movement, and the resistance to it that has resulted in the re-segregation of American schools today. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The Boston anti-busing movement and its national repercussions played a key role in the defeat of school integration in contemporary America,&#8221; Stovall noted. &#8220;Like the challenges to affirmative action and continued police brutality against African Americans, it illustrated the limits of the nation's commitment to racial justice.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160; <br/>
 &#8220;The history of the Boston anti-busing movement is an important part of the history of race in modern America,&#8221; Stovall added. &#8220;Today, America's public schools are more segregated racially than ever, in some respects, and the history of this movement helps explain why this is so.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The magazine noted in its introduction to <a href="http://time.com/4381471/july-4-moments-change-america/"><em><strong>25 Moments That Changed America</strong></em></a> that the article is &#8220;another fitting reminder of just how much can happen in 100 years--and of the way that a single day can change all that comes after. From laws that were passed with unintended consequences to scientific advancements that still affect our everyday lives to a celebrity debut that made a difference, each moment in its own way is an example of how history&#8217;s hinges work.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e675c2b58072701713dacb13879fa294"><name>rna-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Research competition to unravel how cancer changes a cell’s RNA</title><summary>Open challenge aims to find the best algorithms for detecting all of the abnormal RNA molecules in a cancer cell.</summary><keywords>Josh Stuart, Genomics Institute</keywords><start-date>1468510200000</start-date><display-name>Research competition to unravel how cancer changes a cell’s RNA</display-name><path>/2016/07/rna-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/rna-challenge</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1468450323523</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1468511423462</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/logos-600.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/logos-600.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logos-600.jpg</name><display-name>logos-600.jpg</display-name><file-size>66978</file-size><width>595</width><height>130</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/logos-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/logos-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logos-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>logos-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16512</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Community effort aims to find the best algorithms for detecting abnormal RNA molecules in cancer cells.</article-subhead><article-text><p>Scientists from around the world have announced a new challenge to find the best algorithms for detecting all of the abnormal RNA molecules in a cancer cell. This is a community effort, inviting all scientists and enthusiasts to participate in a collaborative crowd-sourced benchmarking effort.</p>
<p>Based on the success of other recent challenges, the new Somatic Mutation Calling RNA challenge will use a cloud model in which contestants submit their algorithms, not their results, to the evaluation. It will be the first challenge to make use of the new NCI Cloud Pilots, which will provide access to co-located data and shared tools as well as some free compute credits that can be used by participants and for final scoring. The challenge was launched on Thursday, June 30, 2016. Registration is available at the <a href="https://synapse.org/SMC_RNA">Sage Bionetworks Synapse website</a>.</p>
<p>Genomic rearrangements in cancer cells produce fusion transcripts which may give rise to chimeric protein products not present in normal cells. In addition, cancer cells can express alternate forms of encoded messages that give rise to protein variants different from normal tissue. These chimeras and protein variants can serve as robust diagnostic markers or drug targets. Moreover, ongoing research efforts are beginning to unveil the potential clinical relevance of these variant RNA products. Increasing the &#8220;alterome&#8221; of tumors by fully characterizing their RNA landscapes will expand our understanding of cancer mechanisms, provide new biomarkers, and reveal possible new RNA-based therapeutics, thus improving personalized patient treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Predicting RNA species in a cancer cell is a particularly challenging task,&#8221; said Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of the challenge leaders. &#8220;RNA expression reflects much of the deranged complexity of the underlying cancer cell DNA and then adds another level of derangement on top of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RNA sequencing</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the SMC-RNA Challenge is to identify the best methods for detecting rearrangements in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Sub-challenges are focused on detecting and quantifying mRNA fusions and isoforms. Methods will be evaluated with both <em>in silico</em> and spiked-in data. Two key questions will be addressed: What is the best way to estimate the abundances of a set of known RNA isoforms, and what is the best way to predict the presence of novel gene fusions? Both of these questions will involve <em>in silico</em> generated and wet lab spiked-in RNA sequencing data.</p>
<p>Like the SMC-Het challenge, contestants will contribute their code as self-contained virtual machines that can be run by the challenge administrators. The contestant code will then be executed on one of the three NCI Cloud Pilots that have been established to facilitate analysis of large scale cancer genomics datasets.</p>
<p>The Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots are designed to explore innovative methods for accessing and computing on large genomic data. They aim to bring data and analysis together on a single platform by creating a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an application programming interface (API) that provides secure data access. The goals of the cloud pilots are to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic and related data and to create a cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community. Three contracts were awarded to develop the cloud pilots, to the <a href="https://portal.firecloud.org/">Broad Institute</a>, the <a href="https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/">Institute for Systems Biology</a>, and <a href="https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/">Seven Bridges Genomics</a>. Each of these groups is developing infrastructure and a set of tools to access, explore, and analyze molecular data.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NCI is intrigued by the potential of the DREAM challenge. Leveraging the cloud pilot concept to enable crowdsourcing to improve cancer transcript detection and quantification shows the kind of significant impact the cloud-based infrastructure can have,&#8221; said Tanja Davidsen, a biomedical informatics program manager at the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Cloud compute</strong></p>
<p>The challenge will initially leverage cloud compute available from the Institute for Systems Biology and then expand to include those provided by Seven Bridges and the Broad Institute. SMC-RNA is based on the containerized software and portable workflow descriptions. As such, upon completion, any compatible cloud system also will be able to replicate the execution and evaluation of all submitted code.</p>
<p>To motivate a high level of collaboration, Sage Bionetworks&#8217; Synapse platform provides leaderboards, the ability for teams to dynamically form and re-form as the Challenge proceeds, and a discussion forum where participants can share ideas. As an added incentive, all individuals and teams that submit a final model will be invited as consortium coauthors on an overview paper of the challenge that will be submitted to <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> as the official journal partner of the challenge. Top performers will receive travel awards and speaking invitations to the 2017 DREAM Conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an exciting development to see several technologies converge on this challenge so elegantly,&#8221; said Kyle Ellrott , researcher with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, assistant professor at the OHSU School of Medicine, and one of the challenge leaders. &#8220;The cloud pilots are available to provide access to scalable compute to large datasets. With the SMC-Het, and now SMC-RNA, we employ an evaluation mechanism that produces reproducible bioinformatics methods. The results of these challenges can be used to solve important problems in cancer genomics. And at the end of the challenge any of the submitted techniques could be made available to the users the cloud pilots for them to apply to their own data. It is truly a dynamic combination that is set to accomplish great things.&#8221;</p>

So when she saw that there were internships available for UC Santa Cruz undergraduates to work on field guides for the <a href="http://ucsccampusreserve.ucsc.edu/">Campus Natural Reserve</a>, she offered to develop a guide to spiders.</p>
<p>Reserve manager Alex Jones said he was happy with the version she produced as a sophomore, but Hash wasn't satisfied with her initial efforts. She returned to the project as a senior and continued working on it even after she graduated in June 2015 with a B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The end result is the second edition of <em>Field Guide to Spiders of UC Santa Cruz</em>, published this spring by the <a href="http://naturalreserves.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Natural Reserves</a>. It is a high-quality guide book full of color photographs and drawings, with informative text written in an engaging, humorous style.</p>
<p>"She went way above what we expected and produced a really professional field guide," said Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who serves on a committee for the <a href="http://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/about/index.html">Norris Center for Natural History</a> that provided some funding for Hash's project through the center's Student Project Awards (funded by a grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation).</p>
<p>Jones guided Hash's work on the project through internships during her sophomore and senior years. "I was very impressed by how passionate and dedicated she was, and by how much she cared about these little creatures that most people would rather squash," Jones said.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficial animals</strong></p>
<p>Hash, currently working on a project in the Sierra Nevada with the Institute for Bird Populations, is well aware that most people don't share her fascination with spiders. "I've rescued many a spider from people's homes, and I always take a minute to show them the spider and explain how it's a cool animal that benefits people and the environment," she said. "I tried to make the book accessible and write with some humor to try to get people to see spiders in a different light."</p>
<p>Even as a child, Hash said, she liked to play with insects and spiders. In high school, she got a digital SLR camera and modified the lens so she could take magnified photos of her favorite subjects. "The first thing I photographed was a jumping spider," she said. "When I saw it close up through a magnifying lens, that was when I got really engrossed in studying them."</p>
<p>Hash took most of the photos in the book, often bringing live spiders home so she could photograph them in good lighting. That didn't go over very well with the roommates she had her sophomore year, but by her senior year she was living with students who shared her interests in natural history and environmental science. "They were cool about it, and that made the process easier," she said. The other thing that had improved by her senior year was her own grounding in science and natural history.</p>
<p>"I definitely grew as a naturalist and a scientist, in part just from being around other people who get really excited about things like that," Hash said. "I know a lot more now about spiders and their ecology, and I'm able to see them from the perspective of a scientist."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;First in series</strong></p>
<p>The spider field guide is the first in a series of natural history field guides being produced by the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. A <em>Field Guide to Birds of UC Santa Cruz</em>, written by Benny Jacobs-Schwartz (B.A. environmental studies, 2013), was just published in early July, and field guides to plants and fungi should be available soon, Jones said.</p>
<p>The guides will be especially valuable for the class Jones teaches on the natural history of the UCSC campus, as well as for other classes in biology and environmental studies that use the campus reserves as outdoor classrooms. In addition, they should be useful to anyone with an interest in the natural history of the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>"They're applicable throughout the Monterey Bay area, the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Central Coast region," Jones said.</p>

My participation on the advisory board represents an opportunity for UC to provide input into upgrades and improvements to the grant delivery systems and policies over the next several years,&#8221; Register said.</p>
<p>The commission is the principal state agency responsible for administering financial aid programs for students attending public and private universities, colleges, and vocational schools in California. The commission&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;to make education beyond high school financially accessible to all Californians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission provides financial aid policy analysis and leadership, in partnership with California&#8217;s colleges, universities, financial institutions, and financial aid associations. The Financial Aid Advisory Board will review major proposed and planned program or policy changes and provide advice and recommendations to the commission. The board is made up of representatives from the state postsecondary segments as well as high school counselors associated with the commission&#8217;s administration of the Cal Grant, Dream Act Application, Middle Class Scholarship, Chafee Grant, and other state financial aid programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick will make a great representative by both providing important campus-level insight and being able to share with our campus and his colleagues about the latest developments,&#8221; Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham said.</p>
<p>Register was appointed to oversee the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office in 2014 after a nationwide search. Previously, he was the campus&#8217;s senior associate director of Financial Aid and Scholarships. He was first recruited to campus in 2005.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eff17f708072701713dacb131a6aab9a"><name>revised-fire-protection-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Review: Revised Fire Protection Policy</title><summary>As required by the standard campus policy review process, Business and Administrative Services is proposing updates for the UC Santa Cruz Fire Protection Policy.</summary><start-date>1468479600000</start-date><display-name>Campus Review: Revised Fire Protection Policy </display-name><path>/2016/07/revised-fire-protection-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/revised-fire-protection-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1468609427955</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1468945790498</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As required by the standard campus policy review process, Business and Administrative Services is proposing updates for the UC Santa Cruz Fire Protection Policy.</p>

Among the 104 confirmed planets is the first planetary system comprising four potentially Earth-like planets.</p>
<p>The researchers achieved this extraordinary roundup of exoplanets by combining Kepler's data with follow-up observations by ground-based telescopes, including the Automated Planet Finder (APF) at UC's Lick Observatory, the twin Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) operated by the University of Arizona. The plentiful bounty of newly discovered exoplanets demonstrates the potential for similarly successful observations in support of future missions such as NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The discoveries are reported in a paper to be published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and currently <a href="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/&#126;ianc/docs/crossfield_K2s_new_planets.pdf">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Kepler's initial mission focused on measuring the frequency with which planets whose size and temperature are similar to Earth occur around stars like our sun. K2 looks at new types of populations, including a larger fraction of cooler, smaller, red dwarf-type stars, which are much more common in our Milky Way than sun-like stars.</p>
<p>"Because Kepler's mission required it to observe only a small patch of sky, it was designed to conduct a demographic survey of the different types of planets. The K2 mission allows us to increase the number of small, red stars by a factor of 20, significantly increasing the number of astronomical 'movie stars' that make the best systems for further study," said Ian Crossfield, a Sagan Fellow at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, who led the research effort. Crossfield will be joining the astronomy department at UC Santa Cruz in August. Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, is a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Rocky quartet</strong></p>
<p>One of the most interesting sets of planets discovered in this study is a system of four potentially rocky planets orbiting a star less than half the size of (and much fainter than) the sun. The planets, all between 20 and 50 percent larger than Earth by diameter, are orbiting the M dwarf star K2-72, found 181 light years away in the direction of the Aquarius constellation. Their orbital periods range from five and a half to 24 days, and two of them may experience irradiation levels from their star comparable to those on Earth.</p>
<p>Despite their tight orbits&#8212;closer than Mercury's orbit around the sun&#8212;the possibility that life could arise on a planet around such a star cannot be ruled out, according to Crossfield.</p>
<p>After the Kepler space telescope had revealed more than 4,000 candidate exoplanets and many confirmed and validated planets during its initial four-year survey, NASA decided to modify its mission after two of the spacecraft's reaction wheels, which help maintain its precise orientation in space, malfunctioned. Under the K2 mission, the telescope no longer stares at one small patch of sky to detect as many planets as possible, but instead scans a much larger portion of the universe while traveling around the sun. Like the initial Kepler mission, K2 discovers new planets by measuring the subtle dip in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of its star.</p>
<p>To validate candidate planets identified by K2, the researchers obtained high-acuity images of the planet-hosting stars from Keck, Gemini, and LBT (among others), as well as high-resolution optical spectroscopy using Keck and the APF. By dispersing the starlight as through a prism, the spectrographs allowed the researchers to infer the physical properties of the star&#8212;such as its mass, radius, and temperature&#8212;and of any planets orbiting it.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Upcoming missions</strong></p>
<p>According to Crossfield, these observations represent a natural stepping stone from Kepler to NASA's other upcoming exoplanet missions such as TESS and JWST.</p>
<p>"Our analysis shows that by the end of the K2 mission, we expect to double or triple the number of relatively small planets orbiting nearby, bright stars," Crossfield said. "And because these planets orbit brighter stars, we'll be able to more easily study everything possible about them, whether it's measuring their masses with Doppler spectroscopy&#8212;already underway at Keck and APF&#8212;or measuring their atmospheric makeup with the James Webb Space Telescope in just a few years."</p>
<p>This work was performed in part under contract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) funded by NASA through the Sagan Fellowship Program executed by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute.&#160;</p>

<br/>
 A Stevenson College alumna, Alma first joined the UC Santa Cruz staff in 1990. Over the years, she has served in many capacities, including special assistant to the vice chancellor of student affairs; executive director for residential, dining, and family services; college administrative officer at Stevenson College; and internal director of Student Organization Advising and Resources.<br/>
<br/>
 Throughout her tenure, Alma has always kept the interests of students foremost. Under her leadership, dining services was transformed from an outsourced auxiliary unit into a university-run operation. More recently, Alma was responsible for initiating UC Santa Cruz's Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE) program.<br/>
<br/>
 In the coming months, I plan to reach out to the Dean of Students office for input on how to restructure student support services. In the meantime, as announced earlier this year, Lucy Rojas will continue to serve as interim dean of students and Mary Knudtson will fulfill the role of interim associate vice chancellor. Please join me in congratulating Alma on this milestone and thanking Lucy and Mary for their service.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin> Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08e955308072701713dacb1378ba4e72"><name>smoke</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Smell of smoke from fire at Wilder Ranch near campus</title><summary>Overnight and this morning a strong smell of smoke was apparent on campus, particularly on the west side.</summary><start-date>1469028300000</start-date><display-name>Grass fire</display-name><path>/2016/07/smoke</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/smoke</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1469028323228</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469043292893</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Emergency</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Updated 12: 30 p.m.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire in the Cave Gulch area</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after noon, Cal Fire officials said a fire that began early Wednesday sending smoke over campus was in the Cave Gulch area on State Park property off Empire Grade. Fire crews had encircled the fire and would be in the process of extinguishing it and were expected to be on the scene at least overnight.</p>
<p>Cal Fire said the fire began in a homeless encampment in a stand of redwoods and burned between 1 1/2 and two acres. There was no threat to campus but odor from smoke continued to be apparent throughout the morning.&#160;</p>
<hr/>
<p>Overnight and this morning a strong smell of smoke was apparent on campus, particularly on the west side.<br/>

The grant supports the <a href="https://treehouse.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a>, which brings the power of genomics and big-data analytics to bear on the challenge of finding effective treatments for children with cancer.</p>
<p>Genomic analysis of tumor cells can reveal the genetic errors driving an individual patient&#8217;s cancer, and doctors can use that information to design targeted therapies. To realize the full potential of cancer genomics, however, the information from an individual patient must be compared against data from a large number of other cases. This is problematic for childhood cancers, which are relatively rare, making it difficult to assemble large cohorts to study.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Initiative was established to enable the sharing of pediatric cancer data so that each patient&#8217;s data can be analyzed in the context of large datasets of both pediatric and adult cancers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genomic medicine requires massive data sharing and analysis, and that is the emphasis of the Treehouse Initiative,&#8221; said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It is only by sharing data that we can deploy genomic insights to their full potential in pediatric cancer and other diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical partners</strong></p>
<p>With the new funding from St. Baldrick&#8217;s, UC Santa Cruz will work with six clinical partners that have agreed to share and jointly analyze data from pediatric patients enrolled in genomic medicine clinical trials: Children&#8217;s Hospital of Orange County; Stanford University; Pacific Pediatric NeuroOncology Consortium; the Pediatric Personalized Oncogenomics Program of British Columbia; Peds Mi-OncoSeq Program at the University of Michigan Cancer Center; and Molecular Guided Therapy in Neuroblastoma at Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Initiative will perform a massive comparison of each child&#8217;s cancer data and cross-reference it with more than 10,000 tumors from previous genomics projects. This huge comparison, known as pan-cancer analysis, uses big data to reveal how genomic aberrations drive cancer. The Treehouse Initiative&#8217;s comparative approach enables researchers to find hidden causes of cancer in individual patients, including targetable drivers of the cancer that may be missed when analyzing each patient&#8217;s data in isolation. This approach can suggest new precision treatments for patients whose cancer has not responded to standard therapies.</p>
<p>Through this new effort over the next five years funded by St. Baldrick&#8217;s, the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative will aim to at least double the number of pediatric patients whose cancers are treated based on insights derived from genomic sequencing. The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has long been a leader in open-source, big-data genomics, and the Treehouse Initiative is bringing a new level of real-time data sharing and analysis to pediatric cancer genomics.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Pilot project</strong></p>
<p>A Treehouse pilot project, the <a href="https://treehouse.soe.ucsc.edu/CKCC">California Kids Cancer Comparison Initiative</a>, has already shown that this approach can benefit children with cancer. &#8220;Our analysis has revealed new therapeutic options for patients being treated in the clinic today. By looking at each child in the context of tens of thousands of other cases, we are demonstrating the clinical utility of data sharing and cross-tumor comparisons,&#8221; said Treehouse cofounder Olena Morozova, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>By sharing data, the Treehouse Initiative allows each patient to immediately benefit from what is learned in other cases. Families are eager to participate, Haussler said. Pediatric cancer is a struggle for every family it touches, and the Treehouse Initiative will work to turn these struggles into meaningful clinical insights that will help everyone faced with childhood cancer.</p>
<p>Haussler is principal investigator for the St. Baldrick&#8217;s grant, and Sofie Salama, a research biologist at the Genomics Institute, is co-principal investigator.</p>

<p>Though this is the first year UC Santa Cruz and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) have hosted the conference its origins are in the pioneering organic agriculture and food justice work being done at the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Environmental Studies Department.</p>
<p>Under the theme of &#160;&#8220;Ecology of Food Systems,&#8221; the education-focused conference will explore critical issues of how we teach and learn about social and food justice, said CASFS education coordinator and alumnus Damian Parr (Kresge, &#8217;00, environmental studies/agroecology), the lead conference organizer who helped found the Sustainable Agriculture Education Association.</p>
<p><strong>Participant directed</strong></p>
<p>Parr emphasized that the conference program is designed to integrate real-time, participant-directed activities with more traditional pre-prepared presentations &#8220;to ensure that the topics and issues discussed and worked on are anchored in the needs and interests of the participants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conference activities and programs integrate practice and theory, facilitating participants&#8217; experiential learning process. The program includes World Caf&#233;, Open Space Technology, traditional presentations and workshops, and field trips to regional agriculture education projects.</p>
<p>Parr said the focus is on bringing colleagues together to learn from one another&#8217;s work, and to foster the development of personal and professional competencies in sustainable agriculture and food systems education. The Sustainable Agriculture Education Association grew out of workshops in the early 2000s and a group called the College Farms Sustainable Agriculture Educators Working Group. With grant support, the group began with workshops at the annual Ecological Farming Conferences in California.</p>
<p>The first annual conference was held at Asilomar in January 2006 and was attended by 140 students, faculty, staff and administrators from more than 50 colleges and universities, and 15 statewide and national sustainable agriculture organizations.</p>
<p>Parr, who first came to UCSC 1991 as an apprentice in the Ecological Horticulture program, remembers two principal outcomes from that first conference: plans for a second conference (which was held at Cornell in 2007) and the creation of non-profit organization that would work to advance the field of sustainable agriculture education nationally. He later became the SAEA&#8217;s first staff member and executive director.</p>
<p><strong>How we teach, how we learn</strong></p>
<p>SAEA conferences are premised on the belief that how we teach and learn is as important as the content of what we teach and learn, Parr said. &#8220;Education ought to be learner-centered, and engage students in both the complexities of real-world problems, and projects that contribute solutions, on a practical basis,&#8221; said Parr who has since earned a Ph.D. from UC Davis in Agricultural Science Education. &#8220;We seek to increase the practice of critical reflection, and an interdisciplinary systems approach to teaching agroecology and sustainable food systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>At UCSC he is research and education coordinator and helps develop curriculum and links between CASFS and the campus at large, particularly with the Environmental Studies Department, where he holds a lecturer position.</p>
<p>The conference is a project of the UC Office of the President&#8217;s Global Food Initiative, and is co-hosted by UC Davis, UC Berkeley, University of Hawai&#8217;i, West O&#8217;Ahu, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Agriculture and Land-based Training (ALBA), Merritt College, and Stanford University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sustainableaged.org/</url><title>Sustainable Agriculture Educators Association</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sustainableaged.org/conferences/2016-santa-cruz-ca/</url><title>Conference website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e3b37228072701713dacb13dc5ec7d0"><name>coe-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Geophysicist Robert Coe honored by American Geophysical Union</title><summary>The AGU has awarded the John Adam Fleming Medal to Robert Coe, professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences.</summary><keywords>Robert Coe, Rob Coe</keywords><start-date>1469084400000</start-date><display-name>Geophysicist Robert Coe honored by American Geophysical Union</display-name><path>/2016/07/coe-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/coe-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1469117575601</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469117774876</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/rob-coe-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/rob-coe-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rob-coe-300.jpg</name><display-name>rob-coe-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>61039</file-size><width>300</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Robert Coe</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/rob-coe-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/rob-coe-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rob-coe-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rob-coe-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19813</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robert Coe</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robert Coe</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has awarded the John Adam Fleming Medal to Robert Coe, professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Coe is a geophysicist known for his contributions in the areas of geomagnetism and paleomagnetism. Much of his research has involved the investigation of the paleomagnetic record preserved in the magnetization of rocks. This record shows how the magnetic field of the Earth has varied over time.</p>
<p>The Fleming Medal is given annually in recognition for &#8220;original research and technical leadership in geomagnetism, atmospheric electricity, aeronomy, space physics, and/or related sciences.&#8221; Established in 1960, the Fleming Medal is named in honor of John Adam Fleming, who made important contributions to the establishment of magnetic standards and measurements.</p>
<p>Coe has received numerous awards in recognition of his research accomplishments, including the AGU's William Gilbert Award in 2007 and a Humboldt Research Award in 2008. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award for 2009-10 from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>Coe will be recognized with other AGU honorees during the Honors Tribute at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting, which will take place in December in San Francisco.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/11/coe-award.html</url><title>Geophysicist Robert Coe earns Outstanding Faculty Award</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22af8dd58072701713dacb13d006fe27"><name>in-memoriam-bridgeman</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Bruce Bridgeman</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz professor of psychology and psychobiology, Bruce Bridgeman, an internationally renowned researcher on spatial orientation and neuroscience, was tragically killed July 10 after being struck by a bus in Taipei while crossing a multi-lane intersection. </summary><start-date>1469460600000</start-date><display-name>Bruce Bridgeman</display-name><path>/2016/07/in-memoriam-bridgeman</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/in-memoriam-bridgeman</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1469460744283</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469508286131</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/bridgeman-bruce-266.png</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/bridgeman-bruce-266.png</link><site>news</site><name>bridgeman-bruce-266.png</name><display-name>bridgeman-bruce-266.png</display-name><file-size>155907</file-size><width>266</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Bruce Bridgeman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/bridgeman-bruce-80.png</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/bridgeman-bruce-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>bridgeman-bruce-80.png</name><display-name>bridgeman-bruce-80.png</display-name><file-size>13901</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Bruce Bridgeman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor Bruce Bridgeman</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Professor Emeritus of Psychology Bruce Bridgeman died July 10 in Taipei, Taiwan.

<p>UC Santa Cruz professor of psychology and psychobiology, Bruce Bridgeman, an internationally renowned researcher on spatial orientation and neuroscience, was tragically killed July 10 after being struck by a bus in Taipei while crossing a multi-lane intersection. &#160;Bridgeman was due to speak that day at the Medical University of Taiwan. &#160;He and his wife, Dr. Diane Bridgeman, were on a speaking tour in Asia where both were giving talks.</p>
<p>Those who knew Bridgeman will remember him for his sharp intellect, genuine sense of humor, intellectual curiosity, thoughtful mentorship, gentle personality, musical talent, and committed peace, social justice, and environmental activism.&#160; He remained an active cyclist &#8211; biking up Coolidge Drive each day &#8211; and enjoyed sailing, cooking, baking, and gardening. &#160;He was a loving, present and engaged husband, father, and grandfather.</p>
<p>Bridgeman joined UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and remained with UCSC throughout his career. Though an emeriti professor, Bridgeman was reappointed to teach courses in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, the subject of one of his textbooks, and had several active experiments running in his lab at the time of his death.&#160; &#8220;Bruce remained a vital member of the psychology department,&#8221; said professor Campbell Leaper, department chair. &#160;&#8220;He maintained a very productive research program that included several UCSC students as research assistants.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>He enjoyed teaching and taking an active mentorship role with both undergraduate and graduate students.&#160; For decades, students in his lab received a hands-on understanding of experimental research, and frequently published articles and presented at conferences with him. &#160;&#8220;His mentorship extended to junior faculty as well,&#8221; said Jessica Witt, associate professor of cognitive psychology at Colorado State University, &#8220;and he exemplified the kind of scientist we hoped to become, allowing data and innovative ideas, rather than egos, to drive the scientific process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridgeman&#8217;s research centered on spatial orientation by vision and perception/action interactions, and his intellectual interests also included the functions and neural basis of consciousness.&#160;&#160;Professor Dr. Wolfgang Prinz, of the German Max-Planck Institute, described Bridgeman as, &#8220;on a worldwide scale, one of the most prominent scholars of relationships between perception and action in the spatial domain.&#8221; &#160;Professor Fred Owens, of Franklin &amp; Marshall College, described Bridgeman as &#8220;an esteemed colleague whose intellect was as broad as it was deep.&#160; His knowledge about perception-action systems was highly integrative, generating scholarly contributions that ranged from perception and psychophysics to neurobiology, philosophy, and the history of science.&#8221;&#160; Owens also noted &#8220;conversations with Bruce always held an interesting lesson or two, often venturing beyond the scientific domain to important matters of global peace, justice, and sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Vilayanur Ramachandran of UC San Diego, whose lab had been looking forward to a visit from Bridgeman in fall 2016, stated: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to conjure up Bruce&#8217;s image in my mind without feeling good. &#160;His facial expression combines wisdom, a slight mischievous twinkle, and patience.&#8221;&#160; He went on to note that &#8220;in an era of sound-bites,&#8221; Bridgeman was rare in that &#8220;he combined meticulous scholarship with high originality. &#160;He was well ahead of the curve in combining neuroscience and perceptual psychology and in that respect we were kindred spirits. &#160;Besides being a brilliant scientist, world renowned for his pioneering work, Bruce was also a very nice guy in the good old-fashioned sense; a true gentleman. &#160;If I was stuck on a desert island with a thousand others, I would probably go to him first for help&#160;and advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridgeman was the author of&#160;<em>Psychology and Evolution: The Origins of Mind</em>&#160;(Sage Press, 2003), and more than 350 articles, chapters, and other publications. &#160;At the time of his death, Bridgeman had numerous papers in process and in press.&#160; He was also highly dedicated to his role as editor-in-chief of the international journal &#8220;<em>Consciousness and Cognition</em>,&#8221; which brought him much professional satisfaction. &#160;The journal&#8217;s publisher Adam Fraser recalled an occasion when&#160;the editorial office received a manuscript from a prisoner who had been learning about consciousness: &#8220;Bruce took the time to assess the manuscript, and while it wasn&#8217;t right for publication in the journal, he wrote encouraging words and gave good advice for how the author may expand his knowledge, hone his skills, and help to use science to turn his life around. &#160;This showed Bruce for the generous and thoughtful man that I knew him to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridgeman earned his undergraduate degree at Cornell University, graduating cum laude in psychology. &#160;He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University, where he studied with Dr. Karl Pribram, and worked as a post doctoral fellow at the Free University of Berlin and UC Berkeley with Dr. OJ Grusser and Dr. Lawrence Stark, receiving both a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Post-doctoral Fellowship and an Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung Fellowship, before joining UC Santa Cruz. &#160;During summers from 1993 through 1999, Bridgeman was a guest professor at the Max-Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich. &#160;Bridgeman was also a guest professor at the University of Padova in 2000 in Padova, Italy.</p>
<p>He received numerous grants from the NIH and other institutions, and collaborated widely with colleagues throughout the United States and the world, both in interdisciplinary settings and within his areas of focus. &#160;In 2012, he was named the Edward A. Dickson Professor of Psychology, a prestigious award for emeriti professors. &#160;Earlier he won the inaugural award for social science research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Bridgeman had an enormous depth of knowledge and interest in history, music, the environment, and of course science.&#160; He and Diane attended and were supporters of many professional and community organizations. &#160;His singing career included the Cornell Glee Club, which toured Asia for the U.S. Department of State in 1966, and both he and Diane sang with the Stanford University chorus, the Berliner Concert Chor in Berlin, Germany, various choral groups at UCSC, a chorus in Bielefeld, Germany, and for many years, the Santa Cruz Chorale.</p>
<p>Bridgeman was an eager advocate of his wife Diane&#8217;s work, including her clinical psychology practice, and her efforts with various professional and community organizations, such as the Monterey Bay Psychological Association, the American Psychological Association, and the Santa Cruz Red Cross as coordinator of its disaster mental health team and its international services committee.&#160;</p>
<p>He leaves his wife, Dr. Diane Bridgeman; and daughters Natalie Bridgeman Fields, an attorney who is founder and executive director of the nonprofit Accountability Counsel, and Dr. Tess Bridgeman, an attorney who is currently Special Assistant to the President, Deputy Legal Advisor to the National Security Council, and Associate Counsel to the President at the White House; their spouses Carter Fields and Beth George; and Natalie&#8217;s three children, Nicholas, Juliet, and Tobin Bridgeman Fields. &#160;He also leaves his brother Dr. Brent Bridgeman and many nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>A memorial event celebrating Professor Bridgeman&#8217;s life and career will be held in October 2016. &#160;Specifics of the event, as well as information regarding a fund that will be established in his honor, will be provided at a later date.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-awoken-from-a-2d-world </url><title>How a movie changed one man’s vision forever  </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/bridgeman.html</url><title>Bridgeman named winner of Dickson emeriti award  </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/10-03/mystery.asp</url><title>Mystery Spot demonstrates power of perception, UCSC psychologist explains  </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d3ca7ba8072701713dacb13a83229a1"><name>schwartz-agu-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seismologist Susan Schwartz elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</title><summary>Schwartz was honored by the AGU for exceptional contributions to the Earth sciences.</summary><keywords>Susan Schwartz, AGU Fellow</keywords><start-date>1469602800000</start-date><display-name>Seismologist Susan Schwartz elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</display-name><path>/2016/07/schwartz-agu-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/schwartz-agu-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1469637763295</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469637988168</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/susan-schwartz-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/susan-schwartz-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>susan-schwartz-300.jpg</name><display-name>susan-schwartz-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>56170</file-size><width>300</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt>Susan Schwartz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/susan-schwartz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/susan-schwartz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>susan-schwartz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>susan-schwartz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19036</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Susan Schwartz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Susan Schwartz (photo by Nolan Calisch)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The AGU fellows are a select group of distinguished scientists who have made exceptional contributions to their research fields and attained scientific eminence in the Earth and space sciences.</p>
<p>Schwartz is a seismologist with expertise in the mechanical behavior of the plate interface at subduction zones, where converging plates of the Earth's crust generate powerful earthquakes. She has done extensive field research in Costa Rica, one of the most earthquake-prone and volcanically active countries in the world, where her work has contributed to the understanding of the full spectrum of fault slip, including slow slip events or "silent earthquakes." Schwartz also studies how glaciers slip over their beds in Antarctica. With colleagues at other UC campuses, she developed an innovative systemwide online class on the Geology of the National Parks to improve undergraduate Earth sciences literacy.</p>
<p>Schwartz received a B.S. in geophysics from Brown University and a Ph.D. in seismology from the University of Michigan. She came to UC Santa Cruz in 1988 as a UC President's postdoctoral fellow and joined the faculty in 1994.</p>
<p>The 2016 AGU fellows will be recognized during an honors tribute in December at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d99b5ae8072701713dacb1370797cab"><name>sutter-scholar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz grad Cecilia Im earns Sutter scholarship for medical school</title><summary>$10,000 annual scholarship established by Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center and the Central California Alliance for Health.</summary><keywords>Sutter scholar</keywords><start-date>1469602800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz grad Cecilia Im earns Sutter scholarship for medical school</display-name><path>/2016/07/sutter-scholar</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/sutter-scholar</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1469643861836</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469644055972</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mark Riley, SMSC</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/cecilia-im-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/cecilia-im-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cecilia-im-350.jpg</name><display-name>cecilia-im-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>57210</file-size><width>350</width><height>401</height></image><image-alt>Cecilia Im</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/cecilia-im-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/cecilia-im-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cecilia-im-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cecilia-im-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17884</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cecilia Im</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cecilia Im</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center (SMSC) and the Central California Alliance for Health (the Alliance) have named Cecilia Im as the recipient of the tenth annual Primary Care Physician Award. Im graduated from UC Santa Cruz in June 2016 with a B.S. degree in neuroscience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cecilia excels in academic performance and in her volunteer contributions to the community,&#8221; said Stephen Gray, SMSC chief administrative officer. &#8220;She is the ideal choice for this year&#8217;s primary care scholarship award, and we wish her well in her pursuits in medical school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Im was raised in Orange County and began her undergraduate career at UC Santa Cruz in 2012. She excelled academically and conducted undergraduate research projects ranging from fungal cell biology (with Barry Bowman, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology) to blood stem cells (with Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering). Im served as social vice president and academic advisor for Kappa Gamma Delta and was recently awarded the Stephen Palais Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research. She volunteered as a scribe for the RotaCare Community Clinic in Mountain View and as the volunteer coordinator for the Santa Cruz County Medical Reserve Corps. She is currently applying to medical schools.</p>
<p>The $10,000 annual scholarship was established by SMSC and the Alliance in conjunction with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation to help carry out a mission to provide high-quality primary care to Central Coast Medi-Cal patients. The award supports a graduating UCSC senior who will be entering an accredited medical school, and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast to practice in primary care.</p>
<p>Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center is part of the Sutter Health network.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="33ebbbd28072701713dacb1369950926"><name>jones-book-children</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Catherine Jones wins 2016 Abbott Prize for best book on the history of children </title><summary>Associate professor of history Catherine Jones has been honored with the Grace Abbott Book Prize for the best book published in 2015 on the history of children and youth.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc news, ucsc history news, catherine jones, grace abboott book prize</keywords><start-date>1469822400000</start-date><display-name>Catherine Jones wins 2016 Abbott Prize for best book on the history of children </display-name><path>/2016/07/jones-book-children</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/07/jones-book-children</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1469749900879</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1469822786487</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/kate-jones-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/kate-jones-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kate-jones-350.jpg</name><display-name>kate-jones-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>115856</file-size><width>350</width><height>479</height></image><image-alt>Associate professor of history Catherine Jones</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/jones-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/jones-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jones-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jones-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23120</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cover of book by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history Catherine Jones</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of History Catherine Jones</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/07/images/jones-book-cover-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/07/images/jones-book-cover-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jones-book-cover-350.jpg</name><display-name>jones-book-cover-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>207928</file-size><width>350</width><height>526</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Associate professor of history Catherine Jones has been honored with the Grace Abbott Book Prize for the best book published in 2015 on the history of children and youth.<br/>
 <br/>
 She received the award from the Society for the History of Children and Youth for her book, <em>Intimate Reconstructions: Children in Postemancipation Virginia</em>.<br/>
 <br/>
 Jones&#8217;s book is about the role of children and childhood in the rebuilding of family life and the life of the nation after the Civil War. She considers how children shaped and were affected by Virginia&#8217;s Reconstruction, based on careful examination of governmental, institutional, and private records, tracking the unpredictable paths black and white children took through this chaotic period in the country&#8217;s history.<br/>
 <br/>
 By exploring conflicts over the practices of orphan asylums, apprenticeship, and adoption, Jones shows in <em>Intimate Reconstructions</em> how race continued to shape children&#8217;s postwar lives in significant ways, demonstrating that children were at the heart of Virginians&#8217; struggles over the meanings of emancipation and the Confederate defeat.<br/>
 <br/>
 The Prize Committee noted that "Jones&#8217;s study is an outstanding example of what happens when one approaches a familiar historical narrative from a child-centred perspective. Based on meticulous, extensive and creative archival research, and successfully blending traditional social history with novel analytic categories,&#160;<em>Intimate Reconstructions</em>&#160;reveals not only how children in Virginia were affected by the process of Reconstruction but also how Reconstruction itself was shaped by concerns and debates about the treatment, training, reformation and protection of children."<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Jones offers a rich and subtle account of&#160;the social, political and emotional gains and costs of emancipation,&#8221; the Prize Committee added. &#8220;<em>Intimate Reconstructions</em>&#160;is an original contribution to the histories of Reconstruction and children, but its detailed storytelling, compelling and clear arguments, and important&#160;lessons on the interdependence of private and public&#8212;of families and the political and economic contexts in which they are embedded&#8212;give it a much broader appeal as well.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The annual event raises scholarship funds to support the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) apprenticeship program that trains new organic farmers and gardeners. Fletcher graduated from the apprenticeship in 1996.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Farming is part of Fletcher&#8217;s roots. For more than 30 years, Fletcher&#8217;s grandfather Lee was farm foreman and superintendent of Cal Poly&#8217;s Farm Shop. His family tended large gardens in their backyard. As an art student in Oakland he volunteered at community gardens.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But when the budding artist came to the 30-acre organic farm and garden in 1996, he immediately knew it was going to be unlike any of his other &#160;farming experiences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;First of all you brought your own tent,&#8221; Fletcher remembers. Until 2009, apprentices would pitch tents in the trees lining the fields where they would live, learn, and work together for the next six months. The idea is that one develops a hyper awareness of the habitat&#8217;s ecology: essential skills for a farmer. But as Fletcher points out, also for artists. &#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Connecting people to their environment</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program&#8217;s philosophy of connecting people to their environment was instrumental in shaping Fletcher&#8217;s approach to art and teaching, he says.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Since graduating from the apprenticeship 20 years ago, Fletcher has established an international reputation for creating site-specific art that considers the interrelationship between the piece, the people, and the place.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He says his appreciation for site-specific methods grew out of his experiences at the UCSC farm.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fletcher shares that he approaches art projects much in the way that an organic farmer would tend to new crops. Just as a farmer examines their landscape&#8211;soil condition, weather patterns, seed variety, consumer interest, tradition and more&#8211;an artist, too, must consider the holistic factors that surround and situate their work.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Art becomes accessible when the artist connects to the audience, says Fletcher.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The people</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While apprentices now sleep in canvas tent cabins reminiscent of Yosemite&#8217;s Curry Village, the immersive environment is a tradition that continues today. Cooking, cleaning, and other domestic responsibilities are shared. Meals are eaten family-style at a communal table at the Farm Center kitchen.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The cohort itself is significant,&#8221; says Fletcher, who remembers learning as much from his colleagues as he did from his teachers. While he later pursued an art career, the program&#8217;s emphasis on community-building influenced Fletcher and his artistic practice for the two decades to follow.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Collaboration is a big part of the apprenticeship experience, Fletcher remembers. It made sense for him to pursue art in the same fashion. Instead of seeing art as a generic object that can be displayed in any white-walled gallery, why not create work in, for, and by the community, he says.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Most art is perceived as something that comes out of a solo effort,&#8221; says Martha Brown of CASFS. &#8220;Harrell makes it clear that art can also be a social, collective effort, much the way farming and gardening can be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Collective Museum</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Connecting people to places is a central theme of the</span> <span>Collective Museum</span><span>, Fletcher&#8217;s newest body of work, now on display at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The project reimagines the campus as the museum. Through physical signposts,</span><a href="http://iascollectivemuseum.com/"><span></span><span>a mobile website</span></a><span>, a catalog, and map, it draws attention to 50 sites across 2,000 acres that carry significance and meaning to faculty, staff, students and alumni.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Seven sites are located across the 30-acre farm and 3-acre Alan Chadwick Garden.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fletcher and his artmaking collaborators Nolan Calisch and Molly Sherman find creative inspiration in farming and community supported agriculture. As the artists explain, small-scale farming provides them with &#8220;a conceptual model for socially engaged art that is cooperative and engages with issues of social justice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Collective Museum</span> <span>includes contributions from notable CASFS alumni including &#160;Cathrine Sneed of the Garden Project and founder of the San Francisco County Jail Horticulture Project (1982-1992), a horticulture training program for inmates and at-risk youth.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Harrell's skill at making connections between lived experience and art is inspiring,&#8221; says alumna Melissa Betrone. She is now the farm program&#8217;s Outreach and Recruitment Coordinator and also contributed to the</span> <span>Collective Museum</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Also participating in the project are Nancy Vail and Jared Lawson of Pie Ranch, the educational farm and organization that teaches high school students and adults about food systems, food justice, and sustainable food production. It was Vail who first told Fletcher about the apprenticeship program at UC Santa Cruz and attended the program in 1997.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;</span><span>The Collective Museum</span> <span>is about listening to other people and opening yourself up to that,&#8221; says John Weber, Director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, which commissioned the project. &#8220;It helps us think about our connections to the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fletcher received his MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in 1994 and a BFA in Photography from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1990. Along with his work as a member of</span> <a href="http://publicdoorsandwindows.tumblr.com/about"><span>Public Doors &amp; Windows</span></a><span>, he has collaborated with filmmaker, performance artist and writer Miranda July, who spent two years in the 1990s as an undergraduate in the arts at UC Santa Cruz. His work can be found in the collections of MoMA, The Whitney Museum, The New Museum, SFMOMA, The De Young Museum and 50 sites across the UC Santa Cruz campus. &#160;</span></p>
