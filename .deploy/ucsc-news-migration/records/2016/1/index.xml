<div></div>
<div>In November, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department received seven reports for stolen bicycles. There were additional reports during the holiday break.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>As we start of the winter quarter, I want to offer some <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/bike-lock-tips.pdf">tips and suggestions</a> to help keep your bicycle safe.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Do</strong>&#160;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Always lock your bike through the frame and wheel (rear is best).&#160;</li>
<li>Lock your bike using a high quality U-lock.&#160;</li>
<li>Lock to a permanent bike rack or a fixed object.&#160;</li>
<li>Lock in a well-lit area with a lot of foot traffic and where there are other bikes.&#160;</li>
<li>Always check your lock before leaving your bike to be sure you have secured it properly.&#160;</li>
<li>Read all signs in the area before locking your bike.&#160;</li>
<li>Consider bringing an inexpensive bike to campus. They tend to be a less likely target.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Don't&#160;</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Lock your bike to itself by simply locking the front wheel to the frame. A bike 'locked' like this can easily be lifted and carried away.&#160;</li>
<li>Lock your bike to items that can be easily cut or that can be lifted once you've locked it.&#160;</li>
<li>Lock your bike to anything illegal, such as stairway handrails. Also, remember to [license](<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/bikes/">http://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/bikes/</a>) your bike. If your bike is stolen, and it was not registered, the chances of recovering it are drastically reduced.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Thieves are less likely to steal bikes that are registered because they know the serial numbers have been entered into a national computer database.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bikes can be registered for free at the Recreation Department during regular hours and at the drop-in maintenance clinic from 2 to 5 p.m. on Thursdays at the East Field House. Bikes can also be registered with the Santa Cruz Police at its station at 155 Center St. or at Santa Cruz fire stations at 711 Center St., 1103 Soquel Ave., and 355 Younglove Ave. The city of Santa Cruz's finance department also can register bikes at 809 Center St., Room 101.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If your bike is stolen, report the theft as soon as possible. If your bike was stolen on university property, report it to the UCSC Police Department immediately by calling (831) 459-2231 ext 1. If your bike was stolen in Santa Cruz city, report it to the Santa Cruz Police Department by calling (831) 471-1131.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, be sure to note your bike's brand name, model, serial number, and value, as officers need this information. Taking pictures of the bike also helps bike owners prove ownership and track stolen bikes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Keep a lookout for your own bike. Many times people are able to find their own bikes. If you find your bike, call the police department immediately.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you happen to witness a bike theft, either by force or stealth, dial 911 immediately and inform the dispatcher where you are and what is happening. Try to remember as much as you can about the suspect for police reports. Reporting a theft helps give law enforcement, public officials, and property owners the most accurate picture of where thefts occur in our community. This will aid in prevention and enforcement efforts.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, UCSC chief of police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17d96d798072701704be48b5b156fa3b"><name>carter-uc-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sue Carter receives leadership award from UC President Napolitano</title><summary>Award recognizes Carter's efforts to deepen climate change teaching and research at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Sue Carter, Carbon Neutrality Initiative</keywords><start-date>1452067200000</start-date><display-name>Sue Carter receives leadership award from UC President Napolitano</display-name><path>/2016/01/carter-uc-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/carter-uc-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1452099071298</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452099357473</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/carter-sue-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/carter-sue-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carter-sue-200.jpg</name><display-name>carter-sue-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>54772</file-size><width>200</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Sue Carter</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/carter-sue-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/carter-sue-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carter-sue-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>carter-sue-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18558</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sue Carter</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sue Carter</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC President Janet Napolitano has selected Sue Carter, professor of physics and associate dean of graduate studies, as one of ten recipients of the inaugural Award for Outstanding Faculty Leadership in Presidential Initiatives.</p>
<p>The honor recognizes Carter's efforts to deepen climate change teaching and research at UC Santa Cruz in support of UC's Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>
<p>In a letter informing Carter of the award, Napolitano wrote, "Through your bold and creative efforts, you have rendered service of the highest order, embracing and furthering the University's historic mission of teaching, research, and public service. Your inspired leadership in advancing the initiatives will have a long-lasting and positive impact on this and future generations of Californians."</p>
<p>Carter, who directs the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development, was also recognized last year as the first recipient of UCSC's Faculty Climate Action Champion Award. Her research focuses on energy-related technology including photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, and luminescent solar concentrators.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/climate-action-champion.html</url><title>Physicist

gives candidates a law degree and a master&#8217;s in applied economics and finance.</p>
<p class="introduction">The program, beginning in fall 2016, will allow students to complete both degrees in 3&#189; years, less time than if both were pursued separately. A typical enrollee will spend the first two years studying law at UC Hastings, the third year in economics at UC Santa Cruz, and a final semester at UC Hastings.</p>
<p class="introduction">The program is aimed at candidates who aspire to work in technology or finance fields rather than the courtroom. &#160;</p>
<p class="introduction">"We focus almost exclusively on applied work: working with data, whether it&#8217;s in the context of finance, or economics, so our students come away with a really deep understanding of how economics is applied to data analysis and how to interpret results from data, &#8220; said Alan Spearot, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of international economics, who was instrumental in the program&#8217;s inception and will teach an econometrics course.</p>
<p class="introduction">&#8220;Lots of law students are interested in going the corporate route, representing hi-tech firms, as opposed to going into the courtroom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These firms have a ridiculous amount of data, and rely on people who code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morris Ratner, associate professor of law, who heads the Hastings side of the program, said both &#8220;schools share a number of commitments, to diversity, to social justice, and, also, to rigorous academic programming. It's that latter shared commitment that sets us up nicely for a concurrent degree program in law and economics.&#8221; Ratner also oversees UC Hastings&#8217; JD/MBA concurrent degree programs with several other universities.</p>
<p>Spearot said the program grew out of the Social Justice Speakers series at UCSC last year at which Ratner and Hastings colleague Joel Paul spoke. UCSC and UC Hastings are already collaborating on the joint &#8220;3+3 program&#8221; that offers undergraduates a bachelor&#8217;s degree and a law degree in six years instead of the typical seven.</p>
<p>Spearot said he spent time on the Hastings campus and &#8220;we felt it would be feasible and a good match. There is a lot of good overlap between the campuses,&#8221; he said. &#160;</p>
<p>To participate, students must apply directly for admission to UC Santa Cruz. <a href="http://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/graduate-program/masters/ms-admissions.html">Admissions information can be found here</a>, and <a href="http://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/graduate-program/masters/ms-program-requirements.html">program requirements information here</a>. The deadline is February 1.</p>
<p>Past graduates of the UC Santa Cruz masters program in applied economics and finance have gone on to careers in the private and public sectors at such companies and institutions as: Cisco Systems, Seagate Technology, Google, Sony Computer Entertainment, Plantronics, Securities and Exchange Commission, all big four accounting firms, Visa, Square Trade, the California Franchise Tax Board, Blue Cross, the World Bank, Stanford University, and the Bank of Japan.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/graduate-program/masters/ms-admissions.html</url><title>Admissions

Debugging the Gender Gap' looks at what society can gain from having more women and minorities code</article-subhead><article-text><p>Students and their families are invited to join the local tech community for a special screening of "CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap," a new documentary depicting challenges women and minorities face in the burgeoning computer industry.</p>
<p>The event, cosponsored by <a href="http://santacruztechbeat.com">Santa Cruz Tech Beat</a>, is free and open to the public. Space is limited. Please register <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2086&amp;cid=3844">online</a>.</p>
<p>After the film, which contains some language and content that may not be appropriate for young audiences, the community will have the opportunity to participate in a panel discussion about challenges in the industry and solutions to underrepresentation.</p>
<p>"A lot of it is raising awareness and changing perceptions," said Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science. "This has got to be a large cultural thing to get women to consider taking these classes and major in computer engineering or computer science. Our nation needs these people. Jobs are going unfilled."</p>
<p>Of the 1.4 million jobs in the computing-related field in 2020, 29 percent are expected to be filled by American workers; less than 3 percent of those will be women. The numbers of women and minorities in engineering programs averages about 18 to 19 percent for women in the U.S., 8 to 9 percent for Hispanics and about 5 percent for African &#160;Americans. In computer science fields, the percentage of women has actually decreased since the '80s.</p>
<p>"It's a pipeline problem," says Michael Riepe, a software electrical engineer and chair emeritus of the Baskin (School of Engineering) Alumni Advisory Council. "The movie includes interviews with people who are making a difference and they show us how to do it."</p>
<p>Ideally girls in middle school, young women and underrepresented groups will be inspired by these role models in the profession. Parents too need to see this is a valid career for their children, Riepe said.</p>
<p>"The lack of a skilled technology workforce is alarming," said Jacob Martinez, founding director of Digital NEST, a youth program in Watsonville. "If we are to compete in the 21st century world economy, we need a high tech workforce and, more importantly, a diverse workforce to drive innovation."</p>
<p>The 78-minute documentary directed by Robin Hauser Reynolds asks: what would society gain from having more women and minorities code?</p>
<p>The answer is "a lot," according to Melissa Liu, who remembers just two other women in her classes back in 1991. A management consultant and Silicon Valley tech business entrepreneur, Lui serves as chair of the Baskin Alumni Advisory Council.</p>
<p>There have been a number of changes on campus to strengthen diversity since Lui was a student. UCSC has student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers as well as the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology Pacesetters program and outreach efforts to middle school and high school students. <a href="https://awesome.soe.ucsc.edu">Project Awesome</a> (Advancing Women's Education in the School Of Engineering) is another active program supporting women engineering students.</p>
<p>In addition to adding scholarships to support diversity, UCSC has revised its programming sequence so students with less exposure to computing will be encouraged to apply. The campus also hosts an annual free Girls in Engineering summer camp that brings dozens of disadvantaged girls to campus to learn about computer engineering and computer science.</p>
<p>Joining McDowell and Martinez in the panel discussion will be Emily Lovell, USCS graduate student; Remington Maxwell, UCSC undergraduate; Sarah Ross, Yahoo software engineer; and Cherizza Lundy, Global Women's Initiative manager at Intel Corp.</p>

<a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>The Institute for Humanities Research</strong></em></a> at UC Santa Cruz will present the 15th annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture--featuring alumnus William &#8220;Bro&#8221; Adams, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities--on Thursday, January 28, at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.<br/>
 <br/>
 As the National Endowment for the Humanities is now celebrating its first 50 years, Adams will share his thoughts on the next 50 years of humanities scholarship and education in an age focused on science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<br/>
 <br/>
 The title of his talk Is &#8220;Wicked Problems: The Humanities in the Time of STEM.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Adams was nominated by President Barack Obama as the 10th Chairman of the NEH and confirmed by the Senate in July of 2014. <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, he marked the official launch of the NEH initiative &#8220;The Common Good: The Humanities in the Public Square&#8221; with an address at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. focused on the humanities in public life.<br/>
 <br/>
 He noted that since its founding, the NEH has made roughly 71,000 grants to individuals and organizations totaling approximately $5 billion and leveraging an additional $2.4 billion in private philanthropy.<br/>
 <br/>
 Adams added that the NEH would be launching an effort to encourage humanities scholars to focus on topics that are relevant to Americans&#8217; daily lives, using grants and new projects to emphasize the link between the humanities and public life.<br/>
 <br/>
 A native of Birmingham, Michigan, and son of an auto industry executive, Adams earned his undergraduate degree in philosophy at Colorado College and a Ph.D. from UC Santa Cruz in the History of Consciousness Program. <br/>
 <br/>
 He studied in France as a Fulbright Scholar before beginning his career in higher education with appointments to teach political philosophy at Santa Clara University in California and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He went on to coordinate the Great Works in Western Culture program at Stanford University and to serve as vice president and secretary of Wesleyan University. He became president of Bucknell University in 1995 and president of Colby College in 2000.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Nicknamed Bro by his father</strong> in honor of a friend who died in World War II, Adams served in the Vietnam War as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and notes that experience helped motivate him to study and teach in the humanities. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It made me serious in a certain way,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And as a 20-year-old combat infantry advisor, I came face to face, acutely, with questions that writers, artists, philosophers, and musicians examine in their work--starting with, &#8216;What does it mean to be human?&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 As senior president of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), Adams has been at the center of the national conversation on the cost and value of liberal arts education. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I see the power of what is happening on our campuses and among the alumni I meet across the country and around the world,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People who engage in a profound way with a broad range of disciplines--including, and in some cases especially, with the humanities--are preparing to engage the challenges of life.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;They are creative and flexible thinkers; they acquire the habits of mind needed to find solutions to important problems; they can even appreciate the value of making mistakes and changing their minds. I am convinced that this kind of study is not merely defensible but critical to our national welfare.&#8221; <br/>

<p>Renovations of the space formerly occupied by Joe&#8217;s Pizza and Subs have begun and new equipment is on order. Opening is anticipated in mid-February, said Iv&#233;ta owner John Bilanko.</p>
<p>The menu will feature fresh, organic ingredients. &#8220;The whole goal is to keep it fresh, keep it simple, and keep it fast,&#8221; Bilanko said. Menu items will include eggs, freshly baked pastries, homemade soups, salad bar, fish tacos, free-range chicken and turkey, and grass-fed beef. The caf&#233; will feature a full espresso bar and sustainable coffee, also craft beers and wine.</p>
<p>The campus caf&#233; will be open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and feature breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Saturday hours will be 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The caf&#233; will be initially closed Sundays, Bilanko said.</p>
<p>Caf&#233; Iv&#233;ta and the Graduate Student Commons have signed a 4 1/2-year lease. The GSC&#8217;s goal is to have the restaurant be more sustainable, by reducing green house gas emissions with new energy-efficient commercial appliances and new LED lighting with daylight harvesting sensors, said Rachel Neuman, GSC business and building manager.</p>
<p>The UCSC Carbon Fund Committee has awarded the GSC $25,000 toward new energy efficient equipment and the GSC is applying for additional grants from the Carbon Fund Grant and the Student Fee Advisory Committee to help cover lighting costs and additional cost for energy-efficient appliances.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to exceed the university&#8217;s sustainability goals right from the get go,&#8221; Bilanko said. He also hopes to source campus-grown produce from the university farm. &#160;</p>
<p>Neuman said the kitchen will have a new look and feel. The existing yellow and black tiles were refinished and are now white.&#160;Plans are in place to design and install new cabinetry.&#160; &#8220;It's our hope to provide a nice, clean and comfortable look that ties in nicely with Caf&#233; Iv&#233;ta's theme,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>John and Yvette Bilanko first opened Yvette&#8217;s Espresso Bar in 1991 in Barrington, Ill., a Chicago suburb. They also developed a wholesale business manufacturing and distributing scone, muffin, and biscuit mixes. In 1998, with two daughters attending UC Santa Cruz, they sold the caf&#233;, kept the wholesale business, and moved to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In 2010, they opened Caf&#233; Iv&#233;ta on Delaware Avenue where they continue making and distributing artisan baking mixes and also operate a catering business.</p>
<p>Bilanko said he wants the campus caf&#233; to be &#8220;like what we do at our other place, be welcoming to the community.&#8221; His youngest daughter, Danielle, will manage the caf&#233;, and they expect to hire up to 25 part-time student employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make it a place on campus where people like to hang out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Neuman thanked the many university units that have come together to create the new restaurant. &#8220;It's been extremely rewarding to see the GSC kitchen retrofit projects moving along seamlessly while working with incredible colleagues across the campus,&#8221; she said, calling out the real estate office, procurement office, GSC committee members who served on the restaurant selection committee, project manager Joshua Francis in Physical Planning and Construction, and numerous staff in Physical Plant who have supported the project.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="231c3e738072701704be48b5935e81d9"><name>management-skills-assessment-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Management skills assessment program – call for applications</title><summary>Staff Human Resources is pleased to announce recruitment for the Spring 2016 Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP). </summary><start-date>1452240000000</start-date><display-name>Management Skills Assessment Program – Call for Applications</display-name><path>/2016/01/management-skills-assessment-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/management-skills-assessment-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1452287999562</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452562635230</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span size="2" style="font-size: small;">Staff Human Resources is pleased to announce recruitment for the Spring 2016 Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP).&#160; The program is designed to assess the management skills of high-potential, early-career supervisors, managers, and professionals for future leadership opportunities at the University.&#160; Previously, MSAP was offered in alternating Northern and Southern California locations, but is now held at the UCLA Conference Center in Lake Arrowhead for all of the UC campuses.&#160; Starting in Fall 2014, the program has been modified and improved, based on feedback from participants and organizers. &#160;<br/>

<p>The board, called the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-on-the-humanities"><em><strong>National Council on the Humanities</strong></em></a>, consists of 26 distinguished citizens who meet three times a year in Washington, DC to make recommendations on grant applications and advise the Chairman.</p>
<p>The three new Council members were nominated by President Barack Obama in the spring of 2015 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in November 2015. The new members can begin serving as soon as they are sworn in at the first opportunity, the Council&#8217;s spring meeting in March. &#160;</p>
<p>Limerick received her B.A. from UC Santa Cruz (Cowell '72, American studies), and her Ph.D. from Yale University.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am eager to do everything I can to cheer for the under-utilized power of the humanities to benefit the nation and the world,&#8221; said Limerick. &#8220;This is a cause I have believed in since the bookcases of my hometown public library provided my habitat of preference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limerick is the faculty director and chair of the board of the <a href="https://centerwest.org"><em><strong>Center of the American West</strong></em></a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where she is also a professor of environmental studies and history. She is the author of <em>Desert Passages, The Legacy of Conquest, Something in the Soil,</em> and <em>A Ditch in Time.</em></p>
<p>A frequent public speaker and a columnist for the <em>Denver Post</em>, Limerick has dedicated her career to bridging the gap between academics and the general public, to demonstrating the benefits of applying historical perspective to contemporary dilemmas and conflicts, and to making the case for humor as an essential asset of the humanities.</p>
<p>A recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship and the Hazel Barnes Prize (the University of Colorado&#8217;s highest award for teaching and research), she has served as president of the <a href="http://www.theasa.net"><em><strong>American Studies Association</strong></em></a>, the <a href="http://www.westernhistoryassociation.wildapricot.org"><em><strong>Western History Association</strong></em></a>, the <a href="http://www.theasa.net"><em><strong>Society of American Historians</strong></em></a>, and the <a href="http://www.oah.org"><em><strong>Organization of American Historians</strong></em></a>, as well as the vice president for teaching of the <a href="https://www.historians.org"><em><strong>American Historical Association</strong></em></a>.</p>
Limerick was appointed to the National Council on the Humanities along with Dr. Francine Berman<strong>,</strong> a distinguished computer scientist who has been recognized by the Library of Congress as a "Digital Preservation Pioneer;" and Shelly C. Lowe<strong>,</strong> executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program. 
<p>&#8220;Dr. Francine Berman, Patricia Limerick, and Shelly Lowe are distinguished, prominent leaders in their respective fields of study and I look forward to their insights and contributions,&#8221; noted NEH Chairman William D. Adams. &#8220;Their expertise will help NEH strengthen and promote excellence in the humanities for all Americans.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="317211f38072701704be48b5cbf26caa"><name>krietsch-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Stem cell researcher receives American Society of Hematology Scholar Award</title><summary>The ASH has awarded a $100,000 research fellowship to postdoctoral researcher Jana Krietsch.</summary><keywords>Camilla Forsberg, Jana Krietsch</keywords><start-date>1452499200000</start-date><display-name>Stem cell researcher receives American Society of Hematology Scholar Award</display-name><path>/2016/01/krietsch-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/krietsch-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1452528505296</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452528676785</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/jana-krietsch-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/jana-krietsch-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jana-krietsch-300.jpg</name><display-name>jana-krietsch-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>63432</file-size><width>300</width><height>365</height></image><image-alt>Jana Krietsch</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/jana-krietsch-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/jana-krietsch-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jana-krietsch-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jana-krietsch-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18101</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jana Krietsch</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jana Krietsch</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <a href="http://www.hematology.org/">American Society of Hematology</a> (ASH) has awarded a $100,000 research fellowship to Jana Krietsch, a postdoctoral researcher in biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Krietsch is one of just 12 basic research fellows to receive the award for 2016.</p>
<p>The fellowship from the prestigious ASH Scholar Award program will support Krietsch's research on blood stem cells. The ASH Scholar Award program funds basic, translational, and clinical research that furthers the understanding and treatment of blood disorders.</p>
<p>Krietsch works with Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering, whose laboratory studies hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for generating a life-long supply of mature blood cells. These stem cells give rise to all of the different types of mature blood cells, and Krietsch is studying how this process is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and how it is perturbed in cancers such as leukemia and in other blood disorders.</p>
<p>ASH Scholar Awards are made possible through support from the ASH Foundation as well as from the corporate community, individual donors, and funds committed by the Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31bfdcd68072701704be48b5deca4d21"><name>applications-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student interest in UC Santa Cruz reaches another all-time high</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz attracted a record 49,133 applications from high school seniors and 9,969 applications from transfer students—also an all-time high—during the recent application cycle for a total of 59,102 applications.</summary><keywords>applications, freshman, transfer, graduate, students, fall 2016, growth</keywords><start-date>1452531600000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2016 applications</display-name><path>/2016/01/applications-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/applications-2016</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1452533597765</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452901666625</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Feature</value><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/applications-450px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/applications-450px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>applications-450px.jpg</name><display-name>applications-450px.jpg</display-name><file-size>178225</file-size><width>450</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>Campus tour</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/applications-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/applications-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>applications-80px.jpg</name><display-name>applications-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>20520</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Campus tour</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Nearly 60,000 prospective undergraduates applied for the fall 2016 quarter, an 8.8 percent increase from the previous year.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Campus boosts applications from underrepresented students to continue having a student body that reflects the diversity of California</article-subhead><article-text><p>A record number of undergraduate students have applied to the University of California, Santa Cruz, demonstrating increased interest from California students and others from around the world for an education that offers hands-on learning opportunities often grounded in social consciousness.</p>
<p>Nearly 60,000 prospective undergraduates applied for the fall 2016 quarter, an 8.8 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>Interest from graduate students also continues to grow, though final numbers are not yet available. Last year, the campus received a record high of 4,316 graduate applications, and it is poised to exceed that figure this year.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz attracted a record 49,133 applications from high school seniors and 9,969 applications from transfer students-also an all-time high-during the recent application cycle for a total of 59,102 applications, according to <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/data-reports/key-reports/student-workforce-data.html">data released</a> today by UC's Office of the President. The UC systemwide application deadline for high school seniors was Nov. 30. The transfer application was extended to Jan. 4.</p>
<p>"It is gratifying to see such strong demand from our California students, as well as the increased demand from students from outside our state," said Michael McCawley, director of admissions. "UC Santa Cruz is definitely on a lot of students' radar these days, and for many of them, we are their top choice."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz saw a 5.6 percent increase in the number of California high school seniors applying. Interest continues to increase from out-of-state students with a 13.5 percent increase and a systemwide high of 23 percent increase of applications from international students. Additionally, California transfer student applications grew by 12 percent, out-of-state transfer applications increased by 42.5 percent; and international transfer applications increased by 22.4 percent.</p>
<p>"I am particularly thrilled to see the growth in transfer application numbers," said McCawley. "Transfer students know that our campus is committed to their success."</p>
<p>There was also increased interest from ethnically diverse students in California. The campus received more freshman applications this year than last from African Americans (up by 11 percent), Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (up by 4 percent), and Chicanos/Latinos (up by 8 percent), continuing its recent trend. American Indian freshman applications declined (down by 8 percent). Chicano/Latinos continue to make up the largest percentage of freshman applicants, followed by Asian Americans.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://time.com/4148233/college-student-diversity-top-campuses/">report</a> by Time magazine listed UC Santa Cruz as one of the top 25 universities in the country that have diversified the most from 1990 to 2014. Additionally, UC Santa Cruz, which became a Hispanic-Serving Institution in 2012, received <a href="../../2015/10/hsi-award.xml">two grants</a> last year from the U.S. Department of Education totaling $3.6 million that will support student success and retention.</p>
<p>"Our campus has continued its efforts to attract students from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds, and I think the fall 2016 application numbers reflect those efforts. " McCawley said. "Of course, the important goal will be to have these application increases translate to enrollment increases next fall."</p>
<p>McCawley cites the work of UCSC's faculty, students, alumni, and staff in attracting more diverse students to the campus. "Our partnerships with student leaders, our ethnic resource centers, and engaged alumni help to build interest from prospective African American, Hispanic, and American Indian students," McCawley added.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has recently expanded its academic offerings to give incoming students the opportunity to major in <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/cres.html">critical race and ethnic studies</a>, part of the Humanities Division. The major will have students studying the dynamic power relations resulting from the cultural and institutional productions of the idea of race on a local, national, and global scale.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has also launched a new interdisciplinary undergraduate program in <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/artg.html">game design</a> within the Arts Division that has students collaborating with peers in engineering for their entire academic career. Students in this new program will receive a degree focused on the design of game systems and other interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students who arrive in the fall will be part of the campus's residential college communities for living and learning, as well as host of special programs, including the First Year Honors Program, Challenge Program, Smith Society, and ever expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p>Like the eight other UC campuses that educate undergraduate students, UC Santa Cruz will aim to enroll more California undergraduates as part of UC President Janet Napolitano's plan to increase systemwide enrollment of California undergraduates by 5,000 for the coming academic year.</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said a new initiative is underway to support undergraduates.</p>
<p>"It is even more important to ensure that sufficient support is in place for students to be able to graduate on time and that such efforts are consistently coordinated with the work of our academic divisions," Galloway said.</p>
<p>Galloway recently <a href="../../2015/11/vice-provost-student-success.xml">appointed</a> Jaye Padgett, professor of linguistics, to serve as the interim vice provost for the Division of Student Success, focused on the academic success of all undergraduates including retention, time-to-degree, and graduation rates.</p>
<p>The campus saw more than a 40 percent increase in the number of students interested in earning a degree in art, art history and visual culture, bimolecular engineering, or critical race and ethnic studies, all of which have seen more than a 40 percent increase from last year as desired majors. Economics, psychology, biology, sociology, and computer science continue to be some of the most popular majors for students applying.</p>
<p>Undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions beginning mid-March. Admitted first-year students have until May 1 to indicate their intent to enroll and transfers until June 1.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranks <a href="../../2015/11/the-rankings.xml">second</a> in the world for the impact of its research as measured by the average number of times its faculty's published work is cited by scholars around the world, according to a survey published by Times Higher Education.</p>
<p>It also ranks first in the nation for the publication impact of the computer engineering Ph.D. program, by the National Research Council. Additionally, alumni have gone on to win six Pulitzer Prizes and five MacArthur "Genius" Awards.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31c011948072701704be48b5bab11612"><name>staff-faculty-blood-drive</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming blood drive for staff and faculty</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board is sponsoring a Red Cross blood drive for staff and faculty from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Wednesday, Jan. 27 at the Stevenson Event Center. </summary><start-date>1452499200000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming blood drive for staff and faculty</display-name><path>/2016/01/staff-faculty-blood-drive</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/staff-faculty-blood-drive</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1452533616979</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452626506692</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The Staff Advisory Board is sponsoring a Red Cross blood drive for staff and faculty from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Wednesday, Jan. 27 at the Stevenson Event Center.<br/>

centuries of Kiowa women watching their men go into battle. Titled "War Mother," the piece includes powerful symbols of conflicts from the Indian Wars to the Iraq War.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Teri Greeves uses the traditional skill of beadworking to tell stories in innovative ways and create a new language that draws people together</article-subhead><article-text><p>When Teri Greeves was little, her mother put her and her sister to work as sales clerks at the trading post she ran at the Wind River Reservation in west-central Wyoming.</p>
<p>There, Greeves and her sister would parrot her mother&#8217;s sales patter, describing the provenance of moccasins, pottery, and pipe bags to tourists who descended on the store. But what Greeves didn&#8217;t realize was that her mother, Jeri Ah-be-hill, a Kiowa of Oklahoma, was also teaching her two daughters.</p>
<p>&#8220;All those years, she was educating me about who I was and where I came from,&#8221; says Greeves (Oakes &#8217;95, American studies). &#8220;Now I can look at beadwork and tell you its origins and whether it is old or new. Sometimes I can even identify the maker.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in that crowded trading post that a long line of Native American beadworkers also taught Greeves a craft that would later become her art. Today, Greeves uses the traditional skill to tell stories in new ways, to create a new language that draws people together, with the result that her work is now on permanent display at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.; the British Museum in London; the Museum of Art and Design in New York; and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. Last year, she was also named a Living Treasure for the Native Treasures Indian Arts Festival, a major fundraiser for the Museum of Indian Arts &amp; Culture in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teri&#8217;s work inspires future generations because it is an example of taking a skill or medium, in this case beadworking, and using it to tell a story rather than simply being decorative,&#8221; says Jennifer Padilla, a spokeswoman for the festival. &#8220;This could serve as inspiration for others to take old mediums and use them to explore new concepts and creations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greeves is talkative as she sits in her light-filled studio in a juniper forest outside of Santa Fe. She tells the story of her grandmother, Sarah Ataumbi Big Eagle, an accomplished beadworker who was born in a tipi during the Indian Wars and supported four children with her craft.</p>
<p>She tells of her mother, a shrewd businesswoman who curated her shop as if it were an art gallery and yet would buy a beaded purse simply because she knew its maker needed money. She talks of how being raised on a Shoshone-Arapahoe reservation influenced her pictorial style, about shifting beadwork from a decorative craft to a form of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Her pieces include wall hangings, wrist cuffs, purses, and even Converse sneakers. Her art, Greeves says, is a form of communication, which is what compels her to work.</p>
<p>The beaded sneakers in the Smithsonian, for instance, tell the story of the ah-day, the favored child in each Kiowa family who was singled out for special attention. The fact of a favorite child may seem unfair, but Greeves believes the ah-day was a tradition that ensured the survival of at least one child as the nomadic Kiowa traveled in search of game and fought wars.</p>
<p>That this ancient story is told on a pair of modern sneakers is a way to draw people in, to break barriers, according to Greeves.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we make a one-on-one connection, then the &#8216;otherness&#8217; ceases to exist,&#8221; says Greeves, who remembers white tourists stopping to take pictures of her and her sister at the trading post as if they were some exotic exhibit. &#8220;So part of communicating through my medium is that people are drawn to it, and then I can tell them a story, and then I&#8217;m not so strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also part of the reason Greeves agreed to co-curate a first-of-its-kind exhibit with the Minneapolis Institute of Art (MIA) that will explore the art of Native American women from ancient times to the present. It is set to open in fall 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teri has such an incredible ability to navigate so many different worlds,&#8221; from collectors to artists to native communities, says Jill Ahlberg Yohe, assistant curator of Native American art at MIA. &#8220;She also has such a passion, such an investment in doing this right. Not for herself but for the millions of women who came before and will come after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greeves says her work often starts as &#8220;this little thing rolling around like a pebble in my shoe and I have to deal with it.&#8221; Whether it is social, cultural, political, or spiritual, that idea will result in hours of research and critical introspection&#8212;abilities, Greeves says, she acquired at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without those skills, I know that my work wouldn&#8217;t be as deep or inquisitive,&#8221; Greeves says. &#8220;I know they make a difference."</p>
<p>She grows nostalgic as she tells of her mother and sister beading a buckskin dress and presenting her with a pair of Kiowa moccasins from the 1800s and a white eagle feather fan for her graduation from UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white eagle feather is a sign of wisdom,&#8221; Greeves says. &#8220;It meant I had brought honor to the family by graduating from college.&#8221;</p>
<p>And although both her grandmother and mother are gone now, there are times as Greeves works that she says she feels herself connecting to some greater force.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you open yourself up to that connection, it flows through you and comes out your hands,&#8221; Greeves says, &#8220;and when that flow is happening, that is the voice of my mother and grandmother and all the other people who came before me.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is their voices coming through my hands.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="36c88f3a8072701704be48b590f987d8"><name>engineering-dean</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz names Alexander Wolf new dean of Baskin School of Engineering</title><summary>Currently a professor of computer science at Imperial College London, Wolf will begin his term as dean on July 1, 2016.</summary><keywords>Alexander Wolf, Alex Wolf</keywords><start-date>1452621000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz names Alexander Wolf new dean of Baskin School of Engineering</display-name><path>/2016/01/engineering-dean</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/engineering-dean</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1452618059533</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452620596483</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/alw-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/alw-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alw-350.jpg</name><display-name>alw-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72771</file-size><width>350</width><height>460</height></image><image-alt>Alexander Wolf</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/alw-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/alw-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alw-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alw-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21404</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alexander Wolf</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alexander Wolf</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has appointed computer scientist Alexander Wolf to serve as dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, effective July 1, 2016.</p>

<p>Wolf said he was attracted to the Baskin School of Engineering's 21st century view of engineering. "The technologies that enable our digital society are all represented in the departments of the Baskin School of Engineering," he said. "If you look at the big trends in Silicon Valley, such as data science, bioengineering, social networks, computer games, mobile and pervasive computing, and "smart" power, they are very well aligned with the areas of expertise at UC Santa Cruz. I am excited to be joining this unique academic and industrial setting."</p>
<p>Wolf's research interests span the areas of distributed systems, networking, and software engineering. He is particularly interested in large-scale systems and has done pioneering work in software architecture, business analytics, and information-centric networks. His current projects involve cloud computing, data-center networking, and mobile wireless networks.</p>
<p>Wolf currently serves as president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and previously served as ACM's vice president, secretary-treasurer, chair of the Special Interest Group (SIG) Governing Board, and chair of SIGSOFT, the special interest group in software engineering. A fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and British Computer Society, Wolf has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit award.</p>
<p>Wolf earned a B.A. in computer science and geology at Queens College, City University of New York, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He spent five years as a member of the technical staff of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Wolf will succeed Joe Konopelski, who has served as interim dean since Art Ramirez stepped down in July 2014.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="425252698072701704be48b59301bddc"><name>mlk-convocation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Black Lives Matter co-founder to speak at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation</title><summary>Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who helped bring to life one of 21st century America’s most influential and high-profile civil rights movements, will be the keynote speaker for the 32nd annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation.</summary><start-date>1452811320000</start-date><display-name>MLK Convocation</display-name><path>/2016/01/mlk-convocation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/mlk-convocation</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1452811637299</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1453755955111</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/cropped headshot.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/cropped headshot.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cropped headshot.jpg</name><display-name>cropped headshot.jpg</display-name><file-size>33297</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/garza thumbnail80</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/garza thumbnail80</link><site>news</site><name>garza thumbnail80</name><display-name>garza thumbnail80</display-name><file-size>12557</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who helped bring to life one of 21st century America&#8217;s most influential and high-profile civil rights movements, will be the keynote speaker for the 32nd annual <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/mlk/">Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation</a> in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The convocation takes place at 7 p.m. Friday, February 12, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>In the past, the convocation has attracted a wide array of speakers, including the Harvard professor Cornel West, the author Alice Walker, and the radical activist and UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor Angela Davis, who drew one of the biggest-ever crowds to the convocation last year.&#160;</p>
<p>But this year&#8217;s incarnation of the event will give audience members a modern-day lens of the civil rights movement and pay homage to King&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Dr. King stood for was not just about what happened in the &#8216;50s and &#8216;60s,&#8221; said Sheree Marlowe, UC Santa Cruz campus diversity officer for staff and students. &#8220;He built a legacy and provided a platform for other activists moving forward. He and other Civil Rights activists laid the framework in the fight against anti-blackness that made it possible for movements like Black Lives Matter to exist. This is an example of how his legacy has continued on through the voices of today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter describes itself, in its website, as &#8220;a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes &#8230; Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements.&#160; It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is a crucial time for the convocation,&#8221; Marlowe said, citing the number of police shootings of unarmed black citizens in the United States. "Based on what is happening nationally, and what is going on in college campuses across America, it&#8217;s important to talk about what it looks like to be part of a civil rights movement."</p>
<p>Marlowe also called Garza a &#8220;pivotal&#8221; figure &#8220;in the fight against anti-blackness.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter roared into life three years ago in part because Garza was furious and heartbroken by the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African American adolescent, and, a year later, by the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who killed Martin. Initially she went to social media to express her grief, and began ending each message with the phrase &#8220;Our Lives Matter/We Matter/Black Lives Matter.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>A signature sign-off turned into a movement name; Garza&#8212;along with Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors&#8212;began to use &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; as a Twitter hashtag. The result was a grassroots activist movement that soon went nationwide.&#160;</p>
<p>Garza&#8217;s work has earned her various honors, including two Harvey Milk Democratic Club Community Activist Awards. In 2015, Garza and the Black Lives Matter co-founders were honored with inclusion on The Root&#8217;s top 100 list for the movement&#8217;s social and political impact.&#160;She is now the special projects director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Garza has also served as director for People Organized to Win Employment Rights, where she led the charge on significant initiatives, including organizing against police violence in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Prior to her appearance at the convocation, Garza will engage in a dialogue with a small group of UC Santa Cruz students.&#160;</p>
<p>During the convocation, audience members will also get to meet this year&#8217;s recipient of the Tony Hill Award, recognizing an individual who is engaged in the needs of the community and seeks to provide tools to work toward solutions. The deadline for the nominations for the award is January 22. The individual should be one who demonstrates hands-on service that results in building connections among diverse groups, promoting equality and justice. &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="427796018072701704be48b5c0c8b6be"><name>reardon-le-monde</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jenny Reardon, sociologist between science and justice</title><summary>Reardon creates innovative forums in which scientists and non-scientists alike are invited to think together about the meaning of common concerns, such as those of race, genetics or ecology.</summary><start-date>1452561360000</start-date><display-name>Jenny Reardon, sociologist between science and justice</display-name><path>/2016/01/reardon-le-monde</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/reardon-le-monde</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1452814079438</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452878951687</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Catherine Mary</name><title>Le Monde</title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/jenny-reardon-le-monde-525.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/jenny-reardon-le-monde-525.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jenny-reardon-le-monde-525.jpg</name><display-name>jenny-reardon-le-monde-525.jpg</display-name><file-size>288253</file-size><width>525</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>jenny reardon</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/jenny-reardon-le-monde-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/jenny-reardon-le-monde-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jenny-reardon-le-monde-80.jpg</name><display-name>jenny-reardon-le-monde-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7008</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>jenny reardon</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz on October 11, 2015.

<p><em>Below is an English translation of a profile of Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology and director of the Science and Justice Research Center at UC Santa Cruz. It was published Jan. 11, 2016 in the French daily newspaper</em> Le Monde<em>. The original in French may be found at the <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/01/11/jenny-reardon-sociologue-entre-science-et-justice_4845380_1650684.html">Le Monde site</a>.</em></p>

<hr/>
<br/>
<p>It is 1986 and Jenny Reardon is 13 years old. She lives in Kansas City in Missouri, a Midwestern state of the United States, when a <em>Newsweek</em> article draws her attention. It describes, according to scientific testimony, the consequences for the planet of changes in the ozone layer. Jenny Reardon begins a correspondence with scientific experts, designs experiments to study the effect of ultraviolet radiation on marine ecosystems, and states her results in a scientific paper. In the following year, these experiments earned her the Grand Prize for environmental science in the General Motors International Science and Engineering Fair, a competition that aims to encourage high school students to pursue scientific careers.&#160; &#8220;Kansas City was not the ideal place to study marine biology but my father helped me set up a laboratory in the garage of our house. I designed experiments while watching, on a black and white television set, the 'Oprah' show, the talk show then in fashion,&#8220; Reardon recalls with laughter.</p>
<p>Despite this early success, it is not in the sciences that this committed, 43-year-old woman excels today.&#160; Rather, she works in the analysis of contexts in which the sciences are practiced. A professor of sociology, she directs the Science and Justice Research Center, created in 2010 at the University of California at Santa Cruz, a university known, since the 1960s, for its avant-garde works. The idea? To create innovative forums in which scientists and non-scientists alike are invited to think together about the meaning of common concerns, such as those of race, genetics or ecology. &#8220;Jenny has a special ability to listen. This has greatly strengthened her leadership,&#8221; says the historian of science Donna Haraway, who works at the same university and who participated with Jenny Reardon in the creation of the research group. &#8220;She knows how to gather experts from different disciplines and to get them to think about the deeper meaning of the jargon they use,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;What I admire in her work is that she is not content with only a critical analysis of what scientists do. Rather, she seeks to open new perspectives with them,&#8221; adds the historian of science Joanna Radin of Yale University. &#8220;Genetics sheds new light on the definition of the human being, but we cannot let the scientists work alone in their corner.&#8221; &#160;&#160;&#8220;Jenny Reardon is impressive in her ability to build bridges between the social sciences and biology, in order to bring them together to have a broader vision of what they do,&#8221; adds geneticist David Haussler of the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Initiated in theology</strong></p>
<p>Creating bridges was not always easy for Jenny Reardon. She is the daughter of a former Jesuit priest who was one of eight children of a famous American cartoonist, Foxo Reardon.&#160; A charismatic man, he introduced her to theology and taught tolerance, without disparaging too much its principles. Her mother was attuned to politics after traveling in Eastern Europe right after the fall of the Berlin Wall.&#160; She was consequently not satisfied with just studying biology and, at the end of her studies, she was undecided between two directions: molecular biology as practiced in the laboratory led by geneticist Mary-Claire King at the University of California at Berkeley; and, science and technology studies, a new discipline that studies social, political and cultural influences on and of science, at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.&#160; At this point, we are in the early 1990s and Mary-Claire King, who will later, in 2014, win the Lasker Award, already enjoys a strong reputation. She had just located the region in genome containing the BRCA1 gene, implicated in some hereditary forms of breast cancer. Yet, ultimately, Jenny Reardon chose to pursue the other direction.&#160; &#8220;It was a very difficult choice. I declined to study in a prestigious laboratory located in a dream location and chose, instead, studies that do not interest many people. I felt I had betrayed those who believed in me,&#8221; she recalls.</p>
<p>A few years later, she returns to genetics, this time with new intellectual baggage. One subject was of particular interest to her: the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), a major project launched by prominent geneticists of the time, including Mary-Claire King, and supported by the US government and then, later, abandoned in the 1990s. The geneticists had nothing other than good intentions: to study the genetic diversity of the first peoples to better understand the origins and the intermingling of populations. But those studied did not see it this way. Accusing geneticists of considering them as objects of study and as &#8220;material for a patent,&#8221; leaders of Native American tribes in the United States vetoed the project. Some anthropologists blamed the project of using modern tools to revive nineteenth century, racist biology.</p>
<p><strong>The history of the concept of race</strong></p>
<p>In her book <em>Race to the finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</em> (Princeton University Press, 2005), Jenny Reardon navigates these divisions to reposition the controversy in the history of the concept of race. &#160;She situates the controversy&#8217;s origins in unresolved questions between geneticists and the rest of the population concerning the relevant criteria to be accounted for in any study of the human diversity.&#160; &#8220;When you look back a hundred years, it appears that the science of the time was influenced by racial representations rooted in contemporary society and leading to the ranking of human groups. Although they deny it, the work of geneticists is still biased by the context within which they work,&#8221; says Gisli Palsson, an anthropologist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik. &#8220;Jenny was among those who went to the heart of the problem. Her book remains the best analysis of the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Science and Justice project is based on that analysis. Promoting &#8220;slow science,&#8221; its goal is to involve all stakeholders in society to reflect on scientific and technological advances. And, thus, it seeks to lead stakeholders to anticipate the implications of these advances before they define social choices. In addition to multidisciplinary meetings, Science and Justice offers a degree to students from fields as different as sociology and physics, to have them collaborate rethinking fundamental and sensitive issues, such as the commercialization of genetic testing by the company 23andMe; or, the use of drones for military operations. &#8220;We try to bring these students together to take into account their respective ways of approaching a problem so that they might think in a way that is not polarizing,&#8221; explains Jenny Reardon. &#8220;We are living in a time when science exerts incredible power on how people are governed. At the same time, issues concerning equity have become acute. Science and Justice seeks answers to this question: what science do we need in this world?&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/01/11/jenny-reardon-sociologue-entre-science-et-justice_4845380_1650684.html</url><title>Original

Freedom&#8212;</em>an animated short by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of art&#160;Dee Hibbert-Jones and San Francisco artist Nomi Talisman&#8212;has been nominated for an Academy Award in the category of best documentary short.</p>
<p>The nominations for the 88th Academy Awards were announced today at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills.&#160;</p>
<p>The short blends animation with poignant testimony to create a haunting story of a man who discovers his brother has committed a serious crime.</p>
<p>The 32-minute film is a portrait of a man at the crossroads of some of the most pressing social topics of the day&#8212;including veterans&#8217; care, mental health access, and criminal justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to acknowledge that our film touches on issues that became prominent and crucial in this past year&#8212;racism, the death penalty and the continuing attack on people at the most vulnerable places in our society,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones and Talisman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope the recognition we have received&#160;reflects a growing support to&#160;change&#160;how we act, think, treat, and stand by those affected.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Last Day Of Freedom</em>, received multiple awards over the past year, including the International Documentary Association&#8217;s Best Short Film of 2015; Best Short Film at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival; and the Filmmaker Award from the&#160;Center for Documentary Studies.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are countless opportunities out there for students and the conference is a place where all these opportunities converge,&#8221; said Blanc, who transferred to UC Santa Cruz in 2013 from Los Angeles City College. &#8220;Universities from around the country are there to recruit us and to help us keep moving forward with our academic dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blanc was one of more than 50 UC Santa Cruz students who attended the national conference for the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). He was also one the five who received an award for presenting about research.</p>
<p>Additionally, the UCSC chapter was selected from more than 115 ones across the country to receive the 2015 Outstanding Chapter Improvement Role Model Award, which recognizes its library and resource website, independent study course, collaboration with other chapters, and engagement with community colleges.</p>
<p>The conference, held in Washington, DC, in late October, gave students a chance to meet with professionals in their fields, showcase their work, and ask questions about graduate school and career development.</p>
<p>Student Joanna Perez led the chapter last year. She is serving as co-president this year with Adriana Landeros.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students had the opportunity to ask graduate schools questions and we had Skype for other institutions that weren&#8217;t there,&#8221; Landeros said. &#8220;We could find out how they look at your application and what the ideal candidates look like for them. They also had undergraduate research panels to give students who are not in a lab information about how to get into one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five UC Santa Cruz students who presented at the conference were given awards for their research presentations</p>
<ul>
<li>Jose Armando Oviedo, &#8220;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: Optimum Power Allotment for Wireless Cellular Capacity Improvement in 5G Cellular Systems&#8221;</li>
<li>Rolando Perez, &#8220;Cell Sifter: Toward High-Throughput, Semiautomated Nanobiopsy and Nanomanipulation of Single T Cells&#8221;</li>
<li>Santiago Sanchez, &#8220;Finding sites of pre-mRNA and snRNAbinding to splicing proteins Cus2, Hsh49, Hsh155, Prp5, and Prp9 during spliceosome assembly and splicing&#8221;.</li>
<li>Nicolas Blanc, &#8220;A High-Pressure Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Chromium Pyrophosphate, &#119862;&#119903;2&#119875;2&#119874;7, to 30 GPa.&#8221;</li>
<li>Jose Garcia, &#8220;Synthesis Strategies to Improve Bioavailability and Stability of Cyclic Peptide Drugs&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The UCSC SACNAS chapter is working to help encourage other students, specifically in middle school, who are less engaged and unsure about science. The chapter goes once a week to Branciforte Middle School to keep students engaged and interested in science.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students went from at first literally saying, &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing this,&#8217; about a project to, &#8216;I really want to know what black holes are.&#8217; That&#8217;s what keeps us motivated,&#8221; said Landeros.</p>
<p>Beyond middle school engagement, the chapter continues to work with community colleges to support transfer students like Ivette Perez, now in her third year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very supportive community for the students; I think of Adriana as a mentor because she&#8217;s always pushing us to get better,&#8221; Perez said.</p>
<p>The students who attended the conference used what they learned to hold a Paths after Graduation Workshop for all students to learn about graduate school, research opportunities, and the application process.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46c392008072701704be48b564c1be60"><name>ucop-retirement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Task force submits recommendations on new retirement benefits for future UC employees</title><summary>President Napolitano will next invite feedback on the task force recommendations from faculty, staff, and others over the coming weeks to help inform the proposal she is expected to bring to the UC Board of Regents in March.&#13;

President Napolitano will next invite feedback on the task force recommendations from faculty, staff and others over the coming weeks to help inform the proposal she is expected to bring to the UC Board of Regents in March.</p>
<p>Once final, the new retirement benefits will apply only to UC employees hired on or after July 1, 2016 &#8212; retirement benefits for current employees and retirees will not be affected. Retirement benefit changes for union-represented employees will be effective upon completion of the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p>UC is developing new retirement benefits options as a result of the 2015 budget agreement between UC and state leaders. Under the agreement, Gov. Brown and the Legislature will provide UC $436 million over several years to help pay down UC&#8217;s unfunded pension liability in exchange for UC implementing a cap on the defined benefit (pension) portion of UC&#8217;s retirement benefits, mirroring the cap on pension benefits for state employees under the 2013 California Public Employees&#8217; Pension Reform Act (PEPRA). This approach will help ensure the long-term financial stability of UC and its retirement program.</p>
<p>Key priorities for UC in designing a new set of retirement benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring UC&#8217;s long-term financial stability that, among other things, maintains the financial stability of the UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) for current and future employees and allows for regular salary/merit increases for faculty and staff;</li>
<li>Maintaining the competitiveness of overall compensation for UC faculty and staff;</li>
<li>Facilitating shared responsibility between UC and employees for individual retirement readiness, and providing programs and other support that help employees prepare for retirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their charge, task force members were asked to explore a range of options that applied the PEPRA pension cap. President Napolitano also asked task force members to discuss possible options with colleagues and constituent groups throughout the university, and to use feedback from those discussions to inform their deliberations.</p>
<p>The task force has recommended that future UC employees be offered a choice between two retirement benefit options:</p>
<p>Option A &#8212; Hybrid Approach: A new UC Retirement Plan defined benefit (DB) plan capped at the PEPRA salary limit (currently $117,020) plus a new supplemental defined contribution benefit (&#8220;DC Supplement Plan&#8221;) with eligible employee pay up to the Internal Revenue Code limit ($265,000);</p>
<p>Option B &#8212; Pure Defined Contribution Approach: A new stand-alone defined contribution (DC) plan with benefits-eligible employee pay up to the Internal Revenue Code limit, currently $265,000.</p>
<p>A summary of the recommended features of the two task force options is provided below. President Napolitano will now ask the UC community for feedback on the recommendations, which she will use to help inform the proposal she is expected to bring to the UC Board of Regents in March.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring UCRP stability</strong><br/>
 Ensuring the long-term stability of the UC Retirement Plan for current and future employees is a key priority for UC, especially at a time when the health of many public pensions across the country has been called into question. Should a stand-alone defined contribution (DC) plan be among the options proposed by the president and adopted by the regents, UC&#8217;s independent actuary has confirmed that, as long as UC continues to make contributions to the UCRP unfunded liability, allowing future employees to elect a defined contribution plan as an alternative to the UCRP would not jeopardize UCRP&#8217;s ability to pay pension benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Community input on the recommendations</strong><br/>
 With the task force&#8217;s work complete, President Napolitano will now ask the UC community for feedback on the recommendations. As part of UC&#8217;s principles of shared governance, the Academic Senate will formally review the recommendations and provide feedback to the president. In addition, two online webinars with senior UC officials will be held in February to discuss the recommendations and solicit questions and/or comments from interested employees. Faculty and staff also are invited to <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/2016-retirement-benefits/comments.html">submit comments</a> through a dedicated website. All comments received will be reviewed and considered.</p>
<p>President Napolitano will use the input from the university community to help inform the proposal she is expected to bring to the regents in March.</p>
<p><a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/2016-retirement-benefits/benefits-options-task-force/members.html">Task force members</a> included faculty, staff, administrators, and representatives from the Academic Senate, the Staff Advisors to the Regents, the Council of UC Staff Assemblies (CUCSA) and UC labor unions. Executive vice president and chief operating officer Rachael Nava chaired the task force. The task force has been <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/2016-retirement-benefits/benefits-options-task-force/meeting-summaries/index.html">meeting regularly</a>, by teleconference and in person, since its first meeting on August 7. Summaries of the meetings are available here.</p>

If so, then you are <em>way</em> too interested in UCSC, but good news, the new <a href="https://mobile.ucsc.edu">UCSC Mobile app</a>&#160;is for you!</p>
<p>UCSC Mobile is for our campus community. The goal is to put the tools and information you need every day into one easily accessible package. The app is entirely online&#8211;just follow the link, no app to download.</p>
<p>Bookmark our home page for quick access to tools like the campus directory, campus maps, news and event feeds, emergency information, and links for getting help with IT, facilities, or housing and dining issues.</p>
<p>We have pages with library information, a staff toolkit, a faculty toolkit, and links to popular sites like employment at UCSC and the giving site for philanthropists.</p>
<p>There is also a feedback form where you can tell us what's missing. We plan to expand UCSC Mobile, building out features that people tell us they need. Want to see class schedules here? More maps? Current shuttle and bus locations? (We're working on that one.) Let us know, and one day it will appear!</p>

 <br/>
 Today Rose is a well-known speaker, a frequent visiting scholar at Stanford University&#8217;s Hoover Institution, a faculty member of the Global Citizenship Program at the Salzburg Global Seminar, and the author of <em>Freedom and Restraint in the Lives of American Teachers</em>. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 She is also currently working on a book titled&#160;<em>Living the Life of Anne Frank: A Childhood in Hiding</em>.<br/>
 <br/>
 On Thursday, January 21, Rose will give a free public talk at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus, beginning at 7 p.m. <br/>
 <br/>
 She will speak about her experiences as a child in Amsterdam during Nazi Germany&#8217;s invasion and occupation of The Netherlands. The title of her talk is: &#8220;My Childhood in Hiding: Amsterdam, 1942-1945.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Seventy-five per cent of The Netherlands&#8217; Jewish population were killed during the Nazi occupation. Of the 140,000 Jews who lived there before 1940, only 30,000 survived the war--the highest death toll of any western European country.<br/>
 <br/>
 Rose eventually came to the United States in 1947. She attended the University of Rochester and received a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Cornell University, a master&#8217;s degree from Smith College, and a doctoral degree from the University of Massachusetts. <br/>
 <br/>
 She has lectured in the U.S. and abroad, including Austria, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and in the Netherlands on her personal experiences in an effort to bring history alive, and to help people see the relevance of her story to the world today. <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Rose&#8217;s appearance on campus</strong> was arranged by Cowell Provost and professor of psychology Faye Crosby. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Because Hedy is working on a book about Amsterdam before World War II, she is a scholar at Stanford&#8217;s Hoover Institute,&#8221; said Crosby. &#160;&#8220;When I learned that she and her husband, sociologist Peter Rose, would be coming to Palo Alto again this winter, I asked her if she would be willing to speak to the UC Santa Cruz community.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Two years ago she had spoken to a small class at UCSC run by Nathaniel Deutsch and had spent some time with me and with Santa Cruz&#8217;s Brigritta Ryle,&#8221; Crosby added. &#8220;Ryle is another Holocaust survivor and devotes her time to educating young Americans about the horrible realities of anti-Semitism. Ryle encouraged me to ask Rose to speak to our undergraduates. We also wished to open the event to all concerned.&#8221;<br/>

says Diane Villalba, a UC Santa Cruz biochemistry major and food access intern.</p>
<p>Villalba is part of system-wide effort sponsored by the UC Global Food Initiative (GFI) to address the challenges of students trying to cope with the rising costs of tuition, rent, books, and other expenses. Results of last year&#8217;s UC Undergraduate Experience Survey conducted across UC campuses show that as many as one in three are dealing with the financial squeeze by skipping meals. Results of a new survey funded by GFI that focuses specifically on UC students&#8217; food security will provide further details of a problem that is not only widespread throughout the UC system but across the country.</p>
<p>UC&#8217;s GFI has made it a priority to help students get reliable access to healthy, safe and affordable food that they enjoy. The GFI Food Access and Security Subcommittee, co-chaired by Tim Galarneau of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and Ruben Canedo of UC Berkeley&#8217;s Centers for Educational Equity and Excellence (CE3), has established working groups on every UC campus to develop food access solutions, from operational to aspirational.</p>
<p>At the upcoming California Higher Education Food Summit at UC Irvine January 21-23 (cafoodsummit.com) working group members will give an overview of their efforts over the last six months, including discussion of a food security survey&#160; by the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources&#8217; Nutrition Policy Institute. Survey results are expected to be released in July.</p>
<p><strong>Working to improve food security at UCSC</strong></p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, professor of anthropology Nancy Chen and Galarneau help lead a working group of faculty, staff, and student GFI fellows and interns looking for ways to improve food access for both undergraduate and graduate students. Chen, a professor of anthropology, also directs the Blum Center and advises graduate students researching income inequality, food security, and housing challenges as part of a Food Security Action Research Hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year we&#8217;re addressing both infrastructure and communications questions, as well as analyzing existing programs to find ways they can be improved, and developing recommendations for new methods to improve student support,&#8221; says Galarneau.</p>
<p>Recent UCSC graduate and CASFS staff member Crystal Owings explains that GFI interns are mapping campus facilities that might be used as food pantries and distribution sites. &#8220;They&#8217;re looking at sites such as the Redwood Building, Academic Resources Center, the new Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, and noting whether they have storage and refrigeration capability, nutrition education and working space, how visible and accessible they are in terms of nearby bus stops and parking, and how they might serve current and new programs,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Villalba, an intern with the working group, also notes that they hope to identify a site to hold cooking workshops supported by campus partners committed to student nutrition and health, and expose students to additional resources available to them.</p>
<p>Working group interns are also looking at ways to improve communications and marketing to students who might qualify for federal assistance through the Cal Fresh Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) program and Slug Support-based assistance provided by campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the GFI interns are working on better understanding what the various departments and programs are doing to reach their students, and how to piggyback on existing communications channels,&#8221; says Owings. &#8220;I&#8217;m also trying to use my experience as a UCSC undergrad&#8212;for example, I didn&#8217;t know Slug Support existed when I was a student.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slug Support provides meal vouchers and Safeway cards along with other financial help to qualified UCSC students through an intake and assessment process designed to ensure that students have a &#8220;road map&#8221; toward their health and wellness.</p>
<p>Says Galarneau, &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to develop the best methods to connect students who are qualified for support but don&#8217;t know that there are resources for them&#8212;we want to develop a better communication system in order to meet student&#8217;s basic needs and help them succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Developing new support efforts</strong></p>
<p>Along with looking at existing programs and how students might better access them, the working group is developing recommendations for new programs that could complement current efforts. Recommendations include &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing Swipes for Slugs, in which students and others can donate meal plan and Flexi dollars that can transfer to Slug Support as meal voucher tickets for their peers</li>
<li>Removing barriers for work study students to qualify for support via CalFresh through system-wide engagement in the implementation of AB 1930.</li>
<li>Creating a &#8220;market-match&#8221; token system for students to use at the newly established weekly organic produce stand located in the Quarry Plaza. The program would provide up to $10 in matching tokens for EBT credit usage through the SNAP program (formerly known as food stamps) per week.</li>
<li>Developing contract renewal criteria that would require all campus retail food sites to accept Cal Fresh and EBT benefits</li>
<li>Launching a food provisioning and nutrition teaching kitchen workshop series for students</li>
</ul>
<p>In developing programs, the working group is also focused on removing the possible stigma attached to seeking and using support. &#8220;We want to advance systems that are accessible and empowering rather than stigmatizing,&#8221; says Galarneau.</p>
<p>For example, the dining meal vouchers are the same as prospective students and campus guests receive for eating in the dining hall, and cooking or nutrition workshops would be advertised and open to all students.&#160;</p>
<p>Galarneau adds, &#8220;We are also looking for food access and distribution spaces that are multi-purpose and serve students across many needs, rather then a sole-purpose site that is hidden in a basement or closet,&#8221; He also notes, &#8220;We want to explore partnerships with music and art students to bring creativity into this work through murals, potential theater performances, and live acoustic music where possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full results of this initial year&#8217;s systemwide working group efforts, including recommendations for improving campus food security, are expected to be presented to the UC Regents in July.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5c54660f8072701704be48b5d93f6683"><name>climate-change</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>After Paris climate deal, what's next?

<span>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about implementation,&#8221; said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of Social Sciences and professor of environmental studies. Immediate and long term solutions are needed, he said. &#8220;We have moved from mitigation to adaptation.</span> 
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The precautionary principle needs to be invoked: what will happen if we don&#8217;t adopt restrictions of greenhouse gases?&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Kamieniecki and other leading climate experts from across the country will discuss the climate&#8217;s future at</span> <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/climate/index.html"><span>the third annual climate science and policy conference next month</span></a><span>,</span> <span>a two-day event co-sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Social Sciences and Physical and Biological Sciences divisions.</span> <span>Panels will address public health, geoengineering, and geopolitics.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Accountability and human rights</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The moral question of climate change is a pressing concern for professor S. Ravi Rajan. Rajan, working with the</span> <a href="http://gnhre.org"><span>Global Network for the Study of Environmental Human Rights</span></a><span>, highlighted a crucial gap in the Paris deliberations by</span> <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/12/climate-conference-declaration.html"><span>drafting a resolution that draws attention to the human rights implications of climate change</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;There is the planetary issue, but there is also a human rights component,&#8221; Rajan said, asking who will pay the costs of the earth&#8217;s rising temperatures and how.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Rajan, a board member of Greenpeace International, sees issues of migration, accountability, and human rights as measures that need to be addressed. He points to the case of environmental refugee Ioane Teitiota from the small pacific island of Kiribati who migrated to New Zealand because of the threat of rising sea levels. He predicts there will be more cases like Teitota&#8217;s to come.</span></p>
<span>&#8220;Who will take these migrants in and what are the obligations of states to take them in?&#8221; Rajan asked. &#8220;People have to do the right thing.&#8221;</span> 
<p dir="ltr"><span>Rajan is deeply concerned about how countries are going to be held accountable to their commitments in the Paris Agreement.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Innovate and experiment</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Environmental studies professor Daniel Press, who attended the Paris conference last month as</span> <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-brings-california-s-climate-change-message-paris"><span>part of the University of California delegation</span></a><span>, said the time to innovate is now.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We only just started to turn a rhetorical corner where people have stopped talking about climate change&#8217;s catastrophic costs and are addressing its opportunities,&#8221; Press said. .</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Press, who has spent more than 25 years exploring the environmental impact of climate change, is co-author of the UC report,</span> <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/Bending_the_Curve_F5_spreads.pdf"><span>Bending the curve: Ten scalable solutions for carbon neutrality and climate stability</span></a><span>, set for release in the spring.&#160;<br/>

They work with pipe cleaners and beads as model chromosomes and sometimes even perform skits to act out molecular interactions.</p>
<p>A growing number of UC Santa Cruz professors are changing the way they teach their classes, doing less lecturing and using more "active learning" strategies to get students engaged with the material. Some faculty have "flipped" their classrooms, recording lectures on video for students to watch before class and using class time for problem-solving activities. Others use "clickers," an interactive technology that lets teachers ask questions during class and immediately collect and view the responses of the entire class.</p>
<p>"There's an increasing movement toward active learning because, even with the best lecturers, students still don't learn as well when they're just listening as they do when they are grappling with the concepts themselves," said Strome, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology.</p>
<p>Strome is teaching a completely redesigned version of her genetics course in winter quarter that is even more interactive, she said. Funds from the UC Presidential Chair she was awarded this year enabled Strome's department to hire an additional instructor so that she can try the new approach in a smaller section of about 90 students instead of the usual 300.</p>
<p><strong>Broad-based effort</strong></p>
<p>While many faculty members have redesigned courses and adopted new teaching strategies on their own, a major grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is funding a broad-based effort in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences to revamp the introductory science courses in biology, chemistry, and physics.</p>
<p>One of the goals is to increase persistence in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) so that more of the students who start college expressing an interest in science stick with it and graduate with a STEM degree. Of particular concern is the high attrition rate among students from underrepresented groups and those who are the first in their family to attend college.</p>
<p>"The problem is that these large lecture classes are not conducive to deep learning, so the introductory courses become a kind of selection process to see who can survive. And we know that active learning techniques reach a broader cross section of the students more effectively than lectures alone," said Manny Ares, professor of MCD biology and associate dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Ares, who is overseeing the development of the new introductory biology courses, said studies have already shown that reduced class sizes and active learning strategies can help level the playing field for all students. The new approach will be used initially in a special active learning section of about 100 students that is being taught separately from the regular intro biology class in winter 2016.</p>
<p>"There are two components to what we're trying to do--reducing class size and getting students more engaged with the subject matter--and both require more instructor time," Ares said. "With 1,500 students a year going through introductory biology, it's a challenge."</p>
<p><strong>Teaching fellows</strong></p>
<p>The HHMI grant is funding three new postdoctoral teaching fellows to develop active learning modules and serve as instructors for the transformed introductory science classes. "We want to develop a whole set of good teaching modules that busy faculty members can adopt and use in their classes," Ares said.</p>
<p>Graduate students affiliated with UCSC's <a href="http://isee.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE)</a> are also contributing to the development of lessons for use in the new classes. ISEE director Lisa Hunter said the HHMI grant is tying together a lot of ongoing efforts to implement innovative approaches to teaching. The institute, which grew out of the Center for Adaptive Optics, has been training graduate students in effective teaching methods since 2001 through its Professional Development Program and is now accepting applications for the 2016 program.</p>
<p>"Graduate students are an integral part of the UCSC teaching community. They teach labs and discussion sections, and they are learning skills and a mindset that will shape the way they teach for the rest of their careers. If we truly want to change how STEM is taught at universities, we have to change the way we are training today's graduate students," Hunter said.</p>
<p>The HHMI grant has also led to a new monthly seminar series, the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ali/seminars.html">STEM Active Learning Seminar</a>, which brings the UCSC teaching community together to share teaching techniques and experiences. Tisha Bohr, an MCD biology graduate student in the ISEE program, and Ian Marcus, an HHMI postdoctoral teaching fellow, took the lead in starting the seminar.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Challenging concepts</strong></p>
<p>Strome said she began changing her teaching style in 2003 after participating in an intensive workshop at Indiana University. Among the most challenging concepts for students in genetics classes is understanding chromosomes and what happens to them when cells divide, so she began passing out colored pipe cleaners to represent chromosomes and beads to represent genes on the chromosomes, so that students could work through the process themselves.</p>
<p>"The diagrams in the textbooks can be confusing, but working with pipe cleaners gives students a visual and tactile experience that helps them understand and remember it better," Strome said. Over the years, she has added more exercises like this to her classes.</p>
<p>Strome said she advises younger colleagues who are interested in taking an active learning approach to make changes gradually and assess their effectiveness. That's what Matthew Clapham did, and eventually he completely flipped the invertebrate paleontology and sedimentology classes he teaches. Clapham, an associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences, said he gradually started lecturing less and spending more time on in-class activities. Now he records his lectures and has students watch them in advance so they can spend class time doing exercises and working on problems.</p>
<p>"There is strong evidence now that active learning strategies lead to better outcomes for students, especially for those from underrepresented groups," he said. "My own impression is that the students are more engaged with the material and are able to talk about it in a more sophisticated way."</p>
<p><strong>Class size</strong></p>
<p>Clapham's classes are relatively small, which allows him and a teaching assistant to circulate through the room and answer questions while students are working. Larger classes present more challenges, especially when there are hundreds of students in a lecture hall with fixed seating, making it hard for students to work in groups.</p>
<p>"In small classes it's easy to have a lot of interaction. With bigger classes you have to be more proactive in getting students engaged," said Kathleen Kay, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Kay teaches evolution in a large lecture hall, as well as a smaller class on systematic botany. She hasn't flipped her classrooms, but she has incorporated active learning activities and uses clickers to keep students engaged and to get instant feedback on how well they are understanding the material.</p>
<p>"I enjoy it a lot more. It makes class more fun, because I'm actually interacting with the students," Kay said. "Lecturing probably works well for students with a good foundation, who take good notes and are self-motivated to study, but I realized I wasn't reaching a large portion of my students."</p>
<p>The active learning approach gives students more responsibility for their own learning, and many students may prefer traditional lectures. It remains to be seen what mix of strategies will best serve the large numbers of students taking introductory science classes, said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences. Some of the active learning modules being developed can be scaled up for use in larger classes, while others could be used in smaller discussion sections or in supplemental programs, such as the <a href="http://lss.ucsc.edu/programs/modified-supplemental-instruction/index.html">Modified Supplemental Instruction</a> offered with many undergraduate courses.</p>

 Shireen Agha Ahsan, 19, a Kresge College sophomore from Palo Alto, and Ahmad Solaiman Nourzaie, 25, a College Nine senior from San Jose, majoring in Earth and planetary sciences, were hiking with friends and classmates when the tragedy occurred. I want to extend my deepest sympathies to their families, friends, and classmates at this very difficult time. <br/>
 <br/>
 Ms. Ahsan and Mr. Nourzaie were early in their college and professional careers with promising futures ahead. It is heartbreaking to think they may no longer be with us. <br/>
 <br/>
 According to reports, they were with a group of UC Santa Cruz students who had climbed down to Bonny Doon Beach. They were on a rock outcropping with another student when a large wave swept all three into the ocean. One made it to shore but despite an extensive search by several emergency response agencies in very difficult conditions neither Ms. Ahsan nor Mr. Nourzaie have been found. The search was suspended last night. <br/>
 <br/>
 Families and friends have organized a prayer vigil for 2 p.m. this afternoon at Bonny Doon Beach. <br/>
 <br/>
 We also want to extend support to all students, faculty, and staff who are in need. Tragic news can be difficult to process. We encourage students who wish to speak with someone to contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (831) 459-2628.&#160; Faculty and staff may wish to call for information on the Employee Assistance Program at (831) 459-3573.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George

campus sites on Friday, Feb. 12</article-subhead><article-text><p><a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/events/2016/collective-museum-exhibition-public-doors-and-windows"><em><strong>The Institute of the Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a> (IAS) at UC Santa Cruz will kick off its innovative first exhibition project--<em>Collective Museum</em>, by the Portland-based artist group Public Doors and Windows--on Thursday, February 11.<br/>
<br/>
 <em>Collective Museum</em> is an unusual participatory exhibition that encompasses 50 sites at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The vast installation comes complete with informational signs displayed all around the university, a photo exhibition spread through five buildings, a museum tour, a print-on-demand catalogue, and a GPS-enabled mobile website.<br/>
<br/>
 The ambitious project spans the university&#8217;s 2001 acres and, as the artists note, &#8220;takes the campus from having no museum to having one of the largest museums in the world.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 To re-envision the university as a museum, the Public Doors and Windows artists collected stories from faculty, staff, students, and alumni about 50 sites on campus.</p>
<p>They range from the site of the first international meeting to discuss sequencing the human genome; to sites of particularly meaningful academic and personal experiences of students, staff and faculty; to natural sites--such as those mysterious mima mounds on the rolling fields of the lower UCSC campus that still puzzle scientists today.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Marking the exhibition&#8217;s launch on Feb.11</strong>, a tandem exhibition will open at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery at Porter College, running through March 12.</p>
<p>It will display sculptures of each site in the Collective Museum, created by students in UCSC faculty A. Laurie Palmer and Dee Hibbert-Jones&#8217;s art classes, along with portraits of the students, faculty, staff, and alumni who provided the sites and stories that compose the project.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;<em>Collective Museum</em> creatively highlights some of the multiple and diverse stories and voices that make up UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Institute of Arts and Sciences founding director John Weber. &#8220;This is in keeping with Public Doors and Windows&#8217;s shared commitment to creating socially engaged artworks. Harrell Fletcher, the group&#8217;s founder, is a 1996 graduate of the UCSC Farm apprenticeship program and now an internationally renowned artist.&#8220;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The collaborative, ecology-conscious legacy of the Farm greatly influenced Fletcher's work, and that of his artistic collaborators Molly Sherman and Nolan Calisch, who also have a farming background. Together, their practice emphasizes working collaboratively with other people, particularly non-artists; an understanding of art as a 'social ecology;' and a belief that art, like healthy food, should reach everyone," Weber added.</p>
<p>Weber noted that C<em>ollective Museum</em> will offer visitors a unique window into the university.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It offers a creative, playful, yet deeply meaningful look at UC Santa Cruz, our culture, and our campus. &#8220;Yet I&#8217;m also sure that even longtime campus staff, faculty and students will learn something new and fascinating about this unusual place,&#8221; said Weber.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This multiple-site, exhibition project breaks new ground for the future of museums,&#8221; added Sesnon Gallery Director Shelby Graham, "by combining collective memory, storytelling, landscape, objects, and walking beyond the gallery walls.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>The &#8220;museum&#8221; will touch on locations</strong> and activities across the campus, even extending down to the Long Marine Lab, and the Forest Ecology Research Plot, a hard-to-find site on the Upper Campus.&#160; Each of the 50 sites is marked with distinctive blue signage, with a short quote from the site contributor and a link to interviews and information.&#160; Additional gallery walls across campus further document the sites and deepen the project. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The artists are calling this project a museum,&#8221; said Weber. &#8220;But it is also a huge conceptual artwork that needs to be experienced by walking, looking, thinking, and also talking with others.&#160;We look forward to creating tours of the project with students as tour guides, just like you&#8217;d tour a museum--not looking at everything there, but picking out a few favorite pieces to share with visitors.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Rachel Nelson, the IAS&#8217;s graduate assistant, served as co-curator of the project while pursuing her work towards a Ph.D. in Visual Studies.&#160; She has worked closely with the artists from Public Doors and Windows over the past two years to help plan the exhibition.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;m constantly surprised at how they were able to capture so much of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Nelson. &#8220;My own time here has been a mixture of intense intellectual moments with amazing scholars like Angela Davis, David Marriott and Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez, confrontations with social forces, upheavals in the form of strikes and protests...all of it punctuated by dreamy walks through the trees and ravines.&#160;You get a surprisingly rich glimpse of this experience in Collective Museum.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 A print-on-demand collection catalogue will document the <em>Collective Museum</em>. It includes archival and new photos about all the sites; a conversation between the artists and historian James Clifford, emeritus professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s History of Consciousness department; as well as an essay about the work of Public Doors and Windows by Weber and Nelson.<br/>
<br/>
 Another catalogue contributor is the filmmaker, performance artist and author Miranda July, who offers an evocative autobiographical reminiscence of her two years on campus as a student. &#160;</p>

The event is now full, but parts of it will be live-streamed on <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/chqqlc7dt0em8j65g0nvo7o35uc">Google+</a>.</p>
<p>The all-day event was organized by Rita Mehta, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz; Meg Lowman, chief of science and sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences; and Heather Tallis, acting chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy and adjunct professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>There are still many challenges for women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers, Mehta said. Issues such as work-life balance, salary negotiation, hidden biases, and lack of role models continue to create hurdles for women in these fields. One goal of the summit is to offer a strong regional network for Bay Area women in science embarking on a career path.</p>
<p>The event includes panel discussions on a range of topics, including "Diversity in science and perceptions of women"; "Role models, allies, mentorship"; and "Strategies for Success: Work-life balance, families, networking, negotiating."</p>
<p>Invited guests include Jane Goodall (Gombe Reserve), Sylvia Earle (National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence), Kathy Sullivan (UCSC alumna and head of NOAA), Jonathan Eisen (UC Davis), Dawn Wright (ESRI), Pam Matson (Stanford University), Jane Lubchenco (Oregon State University), and other prominent scientists. These influential scientists will talk about their careers, share stories to inspire student attendees, and offer an important mentoring role.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.calacademy.org/women-in-science-summit</url><title>Women

lens on shared commons that are under threat, alumnus spends 21 years photographing 526 of the nation’s public libraries</article-subhead><article-text><p>Standing in an isolated corner of the Victorian Gothic-style library in Evansville, Indiana, photographer Robert Dawson caught a glimpse of what looked like an elderly woman dressed in grey.</p>
<p>The shadowy vision sent a slight chill through Dawson, who was in the midst of a 21-year project that would eventually lead him to photograph 526 of the nation&#8217;s public libraries&#8212;a collection that, last year, was purchased in its entirety by the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>The Willard Library where Dawson stood was, after all, said to be the only haunted public library in the United States. Its website not only offered four &#8220;ghost cams&#8221; but also grainy images of what appeared to be an old woman wandering the building. &#160;Librarians had dubbed her &#8220;The Grey Lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was confusing and a little creepy all at once,&#8221; Dawson said of the encounter.</p>
<p>That Dawson (Merrill &#8217;72, psychology) would stumble across a ghost was not the only discovery in a project that would take him and his son, Walker Dawson, twice across the United States, covering 21,000 miles.</p>
<p>In his travels, Dawson would find libraries big and small, humble and beautiful. He would see people arriving at these institutions to escape cold and heat, to learn to read, to catch up on news, to get access to a computer they could not afford. In short, he would discover a community&#8217;s heartbeat: its gathering spot, its historical repository, its intellectual hub, its social services center and, some say, an endangered part of American life.</p>
<p>&#8220;The library is something we can all agree upon in our culture,&#8221; said the 65-year-old Dawson while sitting in his Noe Valley home in San Francisco. &#8220;It transcends ethnicity, class, and ideology.&#8221; In fact, he said, libraries are one thing that bring people together instead of pulling them apart.</p>
<p>Dawson, who teaches photography at Stanford University, began his library mission after a series of collaborative environmental projects that resulted in books. A four-year examination of the San Joaquin Valley, for instance, became <em>The Great Central Valley, California&#8217;s Heartland,</em> published by the University of California Press. A book on water in the West titled <em>Arid Waters</em> was completed with his wife, Ellen Manchester. Other projects included a study of Mono Lake and Pyramid Lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had been working all these years on the commons of environment, something we share,&#8221; said Dawson who spent five years being mentored by famed environmental photographer Ansel Adams. &#8220;I was thinking about what other commons were threatened as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He decided public libraries would be his focus and began lugging his Toyo 4x5 view camera to capture images of facilities in the Bay Area, New Orleans, and Chicago. In 2009, he decided to make it a national project. By 2011, he and his then-21-year-old son were driving their old Toyota Camry across the country to document these institutions. They spent nine weeks on the road, covering 11,000 miles. The next year they ventured out again, adding 10,000 miles to the Toyota&#8217;s overworked odometer.</p>
<p>In Death Valley, Dawson shot a single-wide trailer set under a flimsy shelter that served as a library for the park&#8217;s rangers. In Colonel Allensworth State Park in the San Joaquin Valley, he photographed the re-creation of a tiny library built by a handful of former slaves who&#8217;d come to the area to form a Utopian society in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sign on the front read, &#8216;Tulare County Free Library,&#8217;&#8221; Dawson remembered.&#160; &#8220;I thought that word &#8216;free&#8217; must have meant something to the ex-slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Monowi, Nebraska, a town with a population of one, he found a simple shed filled with 5,000 books. The books had belonged to the late husband of the town&#8217;s mayor and only resident, Elsie Eiler, who pays taxes to herself and grants herself a liquor license to run the tavern she owns. The library is named after her husband, Rudy.</p>
<p>He shot Seattle&#8217;s striking glass and steel library designed by architects Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus, and delighted in the New York library&#8217;s majestic reading room. He captured images of the Americana branch library, housed in a former nightclub in Austin, Texas, and arrived at the Rockaway Public Library after Superstorm Sandy to find residents charging cell phones, going online, and getting warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That says a lot about the place of a public library. It&#8217;s a whole part of community we tend not to think about,&#8221; Dawson said.</p>
<p>At night, sweaty and drained from a day of shooting, Dawson would get himself a cold beer and close himself off in the bathroom of his motel to unload and load film by hand for the next day&#8217;s shoot.</p>
<p>In 2014, Dawson published <em>The Public Library, A Photographic Essay,</em> with a forward by journalist Bill Moyers and essays by writers including Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Anne Lamott, and Dr. Seuss.</p>
<p>Late last year, the Library of Congress acquired 681 of Dawson&#8217;s photographs, along with all his negatives, field notes, correspondence, and maps.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred years from now, the survey will still be a valuable mirror,&#8221; said Helena Zinkham, Library of Congress director for collections and services, in a press release. &#8220;The future viewers will just be looking at the images from their own frame of reference and be able to notice more than we might today, such as which kinds of buildings and services endured; which disappeared; and which were preserved as reminders of another era, of library roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Dawson and his wife are undertaking a project to document literacy efforts in Stockton, which <em>Time</em> magazine called one of the five least literate cities in the country. Dawson also is seeking support for a global library project he will begin this summer by photographing libraries in Ukraine, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and France.</p>
<p>For Dawson, projects like his library series have been a way to learn, to push his photographic skills, and to tell stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;Photography is powerful if it is done right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It can have a voice.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb

and Sciences</em></strong></a> will present its first &#8220;LASER&#8221; talk of 2016 on Tuesday, February 2, on campus at the Digital Arts Research Center.<br/>
<br/>
 Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER) is a national program of evening gatherings that bring artists, scientists, and scholars together for informal presentations and conversations.<br/>
<br/>
 The goal of the series is to feature compelling new developments in the arts and sciences, and to attract audiences that would not normally be found at the same gathering.<br/>
<br/>
 The February 2 event will include presentations by four UC Santa Cruz faculty&#8212;<strong>Wes Modes</strong> (&#8220;<em>A Secret History of American River People</em>&#8221;), <strong>Christopher Wilmers</strong> (&#8220;<em>Who Knew There Was a Puma In My Backyard!</em>&#8221;), <strong>Beth Shapiro</strong> (&#8220;<em>How to Clone a Mammoth</em>&#8221;), and <strong>Dee Hibbert-Jones</strong>, with collaborator Nomi Talisman (&#8220;<em>Making Last Day of Freedom</em>&#8221;).<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Wes Modes</strong> holds an M.F.A. from the Digital Arts and New Media program at UC Santa Cruz and is now a lecturer in the Art Department.</p>
<p>Over the last few summers, inspired by historical accounts of shantyboaters on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, he set out on a series of journeys to record the lost histories of river communities.</p>
<p>The goal of his project, &#8220;A Secret History of American River People,&#8221; is to build a collection of personal stories of people who live and work on the river.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Secret History is the culmination of my dream to build a replica of an early 20th century shantyboat from scratch and float down the Mississippi River, listening to the stories of river people,&#8221; said Modes. &#8220;It is an attempt to step into the river of history.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 To date, he has recorded more than 50 oral history-style interviews, each lasting from one to three hours.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to know the Mississippi through listening,&#8221; Modes explained. &#8220;And in listening I&#8217;ve gathered a strange assortment of river wisdom. I heard from scientists, homeless people living under bridges, merchants, bar owners, river rats, artists, researchers, fishermen, boaters, and people who&#8217;ve lived within sight of the river every day of their lives.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;In my months on the river, I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten a taste of river life,&#8221; Modes added, &#8220;but am humbled by the knowledge of the people I&#8217;ve met who&#8217;ve lived on the river for six, seven, eight, or more decades.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Christopher Wilmers</strong> is a wildlife ecologist who studies how global change influences animal behavior, population dynamics&#160; and community organization. An associate professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, he is the founder and lead researcher for the Santa Cruz Puma Project.<br/>
<br/>
 Since 2008, Wilmers and his team of researchers have fitted mountain lions in Northern California with specially designed collars utilizing radio telecommunications, global positioning, and an accelerometer device to record a variety of activities--from pouncing to mating.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Beth Shapiro</strong> is an evolutionary biologist who specializes in the genetics of ice age animals and plants in order to help develop strategies for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change. A pioneer in a relatively new field called &#8220;ancient DNA,&#8221; Shapiro is an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 She has been named a Royal Society University Research Fellow, Searle Scholar, Packard Fellow, and a National Geographic Emerging Explorer. In 2009, Shapiro received a MacArthur &#8220;genius&#8221; award. Her recent book is <em>How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-extinction</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Dee Hibbert-Jones</strong> &amp; Nomi Talisman just received an Academy Award nomination for their 32-minute documentary short, <em>Last Day of Freedom</em>. They collaborate on art, film, and interactive projects that look at the way power structures and politics impact everyday lives.<br/>
<br/>
 Hibbert-Jones is an associate professor of art &amp; new media at UC Santa Cruz; Talisman is a freelance editor and animator.<br/>
<br/>
 Over the past year, <em>Last Day Of Freedom</em>, has won multiple awards, including the International Documentary Association&#8217;s <em>Best Short Film of 2015</em>; <em>Best Short Film</em> at the Full Frame Documentary Festival; and the <em>Filmmaker Award</em> from the Center for Documentary Studies.<br/>
<br/>
 The LASER presentations begin at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center building (DARC--Room 108). Admission is free and open to the public.<br/>

<p>The new two-year master's degree program in environmental science and management is expected to launch in fall 2017. The program will train students to take a solutions-based approach to social and ecological challenges in the coastal zone, where climate change is increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems that provide natural resources and services to dense human populations and productive economies.</p>
<p>For people to live more sustainably in the coastal environment, solutions are needed that both protect natural ecosystems and provide benefits for human well-being, said Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The core goal of the program is to train a generation of students who have the skills to work at the interface of science and policy," Raimondi said. "A lot of the critical environmental issues in California involve the coastal zone, from the watersheds to the ocean, and this is an area where UC Santa Cruz has a lot of expertise."</p>
<p><strong>Fellowships<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Faculty in two divisions, <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/">Social Sciences</a> and <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Physical and Biological Sciences</a>, are developing a set of core courses for the proposed graduate program. The Wells Fargo grant will provide fellowships that cover tuition and a stipend (more than $50,000) for four graduate students in each of the first two years of the program. In addition, in each of the two years before the program launches, Wells Fargo is funding partial fellowships ($10,000) for five senior Ph.D. students who are working on coastal sustainability issues.</p>
<p>"We already have students who have been doing this kind of thing informally, and this enables us to support them and give them additional training through the courses we are developing for the new graduate program," said Donald Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who helped design the program.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary program will combine training in ecology, conservation biology, and Earth and marine sciences with tools and perspectives from economics, sociology, and public policy. To develop a plan for the program, Croll and several colleagues in ecology and evolutionary biology worked with faculty in the Environmental Studies Department, including Erika Zavaleta and Andrew Szasz. Market analysis from a consulting firm helped guide the plans for the program.</p>
<p>"It's clear that there is a great need for people with the kind of training this program will offer," Raimondi said.</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary approach</strong></p>
<p>Szasz, professor and chair of environmental studies, said the interdisciplinary approach is essential because of the complexity of the issues in the coastal environment, which includes agriculture and cities as well as natural ecosystems that cross the interface between land and water.</p>
<p>"The flows of water and other resources across what people tend to think of as separate spaces are tremendously complex, as is the whole regulatory structure in place to plan and approve projects and adjudicate between different interests," he said. "Anybody working to apply or improve policies in this area has to understand not just the science but also the regulatory infrastructure of our society."</p>
<p>In addition to the two-year master's degree, the graduate program will also provide training to Ph.D. students in relevant fields, adding a designated emphasis in coastal sustainability to their degrees. Recruitment for the program will include strong outreach efforts to students from coastal regions of the United States where there are not only pressing conservation issues and climate adaptation needs, but also large populations underrepresented in the sciences.</p>
<p>Students in the program will be required to work with partners outside the university to develop practical solutions to real-world problems. These hands-on projects will engage students in direct collaboration with partners such as government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and others addressing coastal sustainability challenges.</p>
<p>"The idea is that students will partner with someone who is trying to solve problems, and they'll focus on completing a project to the point of having a product that the partner can use. So they'll get an idea of how the real world works and develop connections with potential employers," Croll said.</p>
<p><strong>Coastal Science Campus</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo's support for the program grew out of interactions that began with UC Santa Cruz acquiring land from Wells Fargo for the Coastal Science Campus, said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>"Wells Fargo is committed to advancing environmental sustainability. We recognize the critical importance of the health of our marine ecosystems," said Hope Hardison, senior executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Wells Fargo. "That is why we are supporting UC Santa Cruz's coastal sustainability program and fellowships so they can develop future leaders and environmental problem solvers who can make a difference in the health of our planet."</p>
<p>Increasing support for coastal sustainability programs is a signature initiative of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which to date has raised more than $222 million in resources for the campus.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to offer fellowships to all students entering the program to ensure broad access," Koch said. "This early support from Wells Fargo will help draw attention to the opportunity to help launch a new and unique program. Graduates of this program will be the environmental problem solvers of the future in California and beyond."</p>
<p>The initial group of Wells Fargo Fellows in Coastal Sustainability at UC Santa Cruz includes graduate students in the Departments of Anthropology, Ocean Sciences, and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.</p>
<p>"These students are keenly interested in sustainability issues and are already working on theses with that orientation," Croll said. "We want this program to produce students who can make a difference, who are working on solutions instead of just describing the problems."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7b6ce0908072701704be48b5253cd748"><name>winter-quarter-welcome</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Welcome to Winter Quarter</title><summary>Welcome back for Winter Quarter and Happy New Year.

<p>I am delighted to see that <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/applications-2016.html">UC Santa Cruz is more popular than ever</a>. Nearly 60,000 prospective students recognize the possibilities of an outstanding undergraduate education here and have applied to join us in the fall.</p>
<p>We have a 5.6 percent increase in the number of California high school seniors applying and a 12 percent increase from California transfer students. Also, more students from other states and countries have applied, reflecting the fact that the good news about UC Santa Cruz is spreading.</p>
<p>I am especially heartened with the continuing trend of significant increases in applications from students with African American, Chicano/Latino, Asian, and Pacific Islander heritage that helps UC Santa Cruz reflect the population of California. A recent <a href="http://time.com/4148233/college-student-diversity-top-campuses/">report by Time magazine</a> listed the campus as 12th in the country among top universities that have diversified the most from 1990 to 2014.</p>
<p>As the campus becomes even more diverse, we are committed to promoting and protecting an environment that values and supports every person in an atmosphere of civility, honesty, cooperation, professionalism and fairness.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed colorful new banners across campus celebrating our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a>. I want to emphasize we will only succeed if we all value and respect each member of our campus community. It is fundamental to how we work together as scholars and as colleagues. The new banners help promote this message and are part of a larger effort to remind us to embrace diversity, be open, be purposeful, be caring, be just, be disciplined, and be celebrative.</p>
<p>I also want to let you know that we've <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/cpevc-search/">launched a national search to find a successor to Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</a>. Paul Koch, dean of Physical and Biological Sciences, is heading the search committee. We will have more information as the search continues and you will be invited to participate.</p>
<p>Two events are coming up that I want to draw your attention to. First, William D. "Bro" Adams is the speaker for our <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/maitra-bro-adams.html">2016 Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture, Thursday, January 28</a>. Adams, who earned his Ph.D. in History of Consciousness here, is chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and speaks eloquently on how the humanities are vital in our age.</p>
<p>Then, on February 12, we are incredibly fortunate and honored to have Alicia Garza, social activist and co-creator of the viral twitter hashtag and movement Black Lives Matter, as keynote speaker for the 32nd annual <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/mlk/">Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Convocation</a> at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. Don't miss it.</p>

The prestigious fellowship recognizes promising environmental leaders and provides $15,000 to support their research.</p>
<p>Hoyt studies the ecology of infectious wildlife diseases, with a focus on white-nose syndrome in bats. White-nose syndrome is a deadly fungal disease that was first detected in North America in 2006 and has since killed millions of bats. Hoyt's contributions include a study identifying strains of bacteria that occur naturally on bat skin and inhibit the growth of the fungus. Trials are under way to see if the bacteria can be effective in limiting the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Hoyt works with EEB professor Marm Kilpatrick and associate adjunct professor Winifred Frick, who lead several major research projects on white-nose syndrome at UC Santa Cruz. In 2014, he traveled to northeast China to find out if the disease, known to exist in Europe, also occurs in Asia. With support from the National Science Foundation, Hoyt partnered with researchers from the Northeast Normal University in Changchun, China, to explore caves in search of the deadly fungus. They detected the disease in 9 out of twelve sites and later confirmed its presence in 75 percent of samples comprising three species. Hoyt and his colleagues hope to glean helpful clues from Asian and European bat species, which may be more resilient than their counterparts in North America.</p>
<p>Hoyt has also participated in the development and implementation of the National White-Nose Syndrome Plan in partnership with tribal, state, and federal agencies. Hoyt said he wants to continue using research to shape policy to prevent the spread of wildlife pathogens.</p>
<p>Since its 1986 inception, the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation has awarded nearly $15 million through its Environmental Fellowship Program and other grant programs.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.switzernetwork.org/users/joseph-hoyt</url><title>Joseph Hoyt bio (Switzer Foundation)</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/bat-disease-china.html</url><title>Bat disease fungus found to be widespread in northeast China</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/bat-disease-grants.html</url><title>Grants fund efforts by UC Santa Cruz scientists to fight deadly bat disease</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/bat-disease-treatment.html</url><title>Bacteria inhibit bat-killing fungus, could combat white-nose syndrome</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="802f00b18072701704be48b599ab855b"><name>mercury-trends</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mercury levels in rainfall are rising in parts of North America, study finds</title><summary>Trends are consistent with increased mercury emissions in Asia and decreased emissions in North America.</summary><keywords>mercury, mercury pollution, mercury deposition, mercury deposition trends, Peter Weiss-Penzias, Peter Weiss</keywords><start-date>1453910400000</start-date><display-name>Mercury levels in rainfall are rising in parts of North America, study finds</display-name><path>/2016/01/mercury-trends</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/mercury-trends</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1453849509996</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1453910623783</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/monitoring-site-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/monitoring-site-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>monitoring-site-400.jpg</name><display-name>monitoring-site-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>131037</file-size><width>400</width><height>492</height></image><image-alt>researcher at mercury monitoring site</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/01/images/monitoring-site-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/01/images/monitoring-site-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>monitoring-site-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>monitoring-site-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17822</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher at mercury monitoring site</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Monitoring sites like this one in Oregon maintained by the U.S. Forest Service collect precipitation samples which are then analyzed for mercury, sulfate, nitrate, and other pollutants.

At other sites, including those along the East Coast, mercury levels in rainfall have been trending steadily downward over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with increased emissions of mercury from coal-burning power plants in Asia and decreased emissions in North America, according to Peter Weiss-Penzias, an environmental toxicologist at UC Santa Cruz. Weiss-Penzias is first author of a paper on the findings published in the journal <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> (in press, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716300614">available online</a>).</p>
<p>Mercury is a toxic element released into the environment through a variety of human activities, including the burning of coal, as well as by natural processes. Rainfall washes mercury out of the atmosphere and into soils and surface waters. Bacteria convert elemental mercury into a more toxic form, methyl mercury, which becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms higher up the food chain. Mercury concentrations in some predatory fish are high enough to raise health concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring network</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, researchers analyzed data from a network of monitoring sites in the United States and Canada that collect measurements of mercury in precipitation. The network has been collecting data since 1997, but monitoring sites were initially concentrated in the eastern United States, while sites in the Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and West Coast regions were added only relatively recently. The long-term dataset extending back to 1997, which represents mostly the eastern regions, showed an overall decline in mercury concentrations. But when the researchers looked at more recent time periods starting in 2007 or 2008, they found many sites with significant positive trends in mercury concentrations.</p>
<p>"This hadn't been observed before, and the sites with positive trends were primarily concentrated in the Intermountain West and in the central part of the continent, in the Rocky Mountain, Plains, and Midwest regions," Weiss-Penzias said. "On the Eastern Seaboard, the trend was still largely negative even for the shorter time periods."</p>
<p>Coauthor Mark Brigham of the U.S. Geological Survey noted that the findings are broadly consistent with other recent reports of decreasing atmospheric mercury deposition in North America since about 1997, but with a new twist.</p>
<p>"By examining trends in more detailed time increments and more geographic detail, we saw that in recent years the long-term decreasing trend has leveled off, and some sites in the western U.S. are even seeing increases, which we think is due to increasing mercury emissions from Asia," Brigham said. "So the reductions in North American mercury emissions are primarily benefiting the eastern U.S., where there is a greater concentration of emissions."</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at trends in sulfate concentrations in rainfall, which is an indicator of local sources of emissions from coal combustion. While mercury and sulfate concentrations were closely correlated at East Coast monitoring sites, other sites showed a stark contrast between rising mercury concentrations and falling sulfate concentrations.</p>
<p>"This indicates that mercury emissions in the U.S. and Canada are not the cause for the observed upward tendencies in mercury concentrations," Weiss-Penzias said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Emission controls</strong></p>
<p>Mercury emissions have declined in North America and Europe for several reasons, including better emissions controls and increasing use of natural gas rather than coal as a fuel for power plants. The "scrubber" systems installed at coal-fired power plants in North America and Europe since the early 1990s to combat acid rain also reduce mercury emissions.</p>
<p>Emissions from Asia have been increasing, however, and are transported over long distances in the upper atmosphere. The influence of the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains on weather systems results in mercury from the upper atmosphere being deposited in precipitation in western states such as Nevada and Idaho and in the central United States, Weiss-Penzias said.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at trends for concentrations of gaseous mercury in the atmosphere, although less data are available than for mercury in rainfall. By merging several short-term datasets for air concentrations in North America, they found the trends were similar to the pattern for mercury in rainfall: a downward trend for the early time period (1998-2007), shifting to a flat slope for the recent period (2008-2013).</p>
<p>"A lot less mercury is being emitted to the atmosphere in the U.S. and Canada than 20 years ago as a result of regulations, efforts by industry, and the economic realities of cheap natural gas," Weiss-Penzias said. "In spite of that, there are other factors, including emissions from other parts of the world, that are causing an increase in the amount of mercury being deposited in certain locations in North America."</p>
<p>In addition to Weiss-Penzias and Brigham, the coauthors of the study include David Gay, coordinator of the <a href="http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/">National Atmospheric Deposition Program</a> (NADP) and the NADP's <a href="http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/mdn/">Mercury Deposition Network</a>; Matthew Parsons at the Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada; Mae Gustin at the University of Nevada, Reno; and Arnout ter Schure at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

href="http://www.neh.gov"><em><strong>National Endowment for the Humanities</strong></em></a> (NEH).<br/>
<br/>
 The campus received three awards of $50,400 to support faculty research, as well as a $119,417 grant from the NEH&#8217;s Seminars for School Teachers program to support the Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 Literature professor <strong>Kirsten Gruesz</strong> earned a grant for her project &#8220;Language, Identity, and American Memory in Cotton Mather's La fe del christiano (1699).&#8221; She will use the funds to prepare a book-length study of La fe del Cristiano, the first Spanish-language publication in English North America, written by Puritan minister Cotton Mather (1663-1728).<br/>
<br/>
 Film and digital media associate professor <strong>Peter Limbrick</strong> was awarded a grant for his project, &#8220;Moroccan Director Moumen Smihi (b.1945): Arab Modernities and Cinema.&#8221; The funds will support his research and writing leading to publication of a book on the films of acclaimed Moroccan filmmaker Moumen Smihi and the history of colonialism in the Arab world.<br/>
<br/>
 Assistant professor of philosophy <strong>Samantha Matherne</strong> received her grant from the NEH&#8217;s Fellowships for University Teachers program. Titled &#8220;The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer (1874-1945),&#8221; this project will support her book on the German philosopher, who is one of the leading 20th century advocates of philosophical idealism.<br/>
<br/>
 The <strong>Dickens Project</strong> additionally was awarded a grant to host a four-week seminar for school teachers next summer on campus from July 3-29. Titled &#8220;Dickens: Hard Times and A Tale of Two Cities,&#8221; this project will be managed by emeritus literature professor <strong>John Jordan</strong>, director of the Dickens Project.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Words cannot express the sorrow we feel as a campus community. We want to extend our deepest personal condolences to her family, friends, and classmates.<br/>
<br/>
 A memorial gathering that had been planned for tonight at Kresge Town Hall will be rescheduled.<br/>
<br/>
 Shireen&#8217;s body was found Monday evening on a beach at Wilder Ranch State Park about five miles from where she was lost last week. The search continues for Ahmad Solaiman Nourzaie, a College Nine senior, missing after the same tragic accident.<br/>
<br/>
 Shireen was from Palo Alto. She was well loved and admired as a role model on campus and in life. At Kresge, she was active in her college community as an academic assistant with the core course and with the Muslim Student Association. She hadn&#8217;t chosen a major yet but was interested in computer science. She will be deeply missed.<br/>
<br/>
 Her family has created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shireenahsanOG/">Facebook page</a> in her memory.<br/>
<br/>
 We also want to extend support to all students, faculty, and staff who may need it. Tragic news can be difficult to process. We encourage students who wish to speak with someone to contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (831) 459-2628.&#160; Faculty and staff may wish to call for information on the Employee Assistance Program at (831) 459-3573.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8fc4ed5e8072701704be48b598ce95a6"><name>all-gender-sign-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>All-gender restroom sign design survey: Tell us what you think</title><summary>The Gender Inclusive Facilities Implementation Workgroup seeks your feedback on proposed designs for all-gender restroom signs.</summary><start-date>1454110380000</start-date><display-name>All-gender restroom sign design survey</display-name><path>/2016/01/all-gender-sign-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/all-gender-sign-survey</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1454110993728</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1454111020870</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Gender Inclusive Facilities Implementation Workgroup seeks your feedback on proposed designs for all-gender restroom signs.</p>

<p>Soon you will receive an email invitation to participate in a survey regarding proposed designs. Many designs were considered by our workgroup sign subcommittee in consultation with stakeholder students before selecting the designs to be included in the survey. When you receive the survey email, please respond by the deadline so that your voice can be heard and considered in making this decision.</p>
<p>We appreciate your participation and your support in making UC Santa Cruz a safe and welcoming place for everyone.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="71b9d41e8072701704be48b550cfd788"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2016/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/01/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1453606949892</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477419587149</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
