<p>Donated by The Marin Community Foundation<em>, <strong>The Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Collection</strong></em> is the largest single gift in the campus&#8217;s history, with an estimated value of $32 million.</p>
<p>The gift comprises over 12,000 photographic prints, 25,000 negatives, and thousands of transparencies created by photographer <strong>Pirkle Jones</strong> over the course of his career, as well as prints and negatives by his wife and partner, <strong>Ruth-Marion Baruch</strong>, plus a selection of prints by such colleagues and collaborators as <strong>Dorothea Lange</strong>, <strong>Edward Weston</strong>, <strong>Ansel Adams</strong>, and <strong>Minor White</strong>.</p>
<p>"These images tell the story of California at a time of tremendous social change. The collection is an extraordinary resource for scholars, students, and ultimately the public," said Chancellor George Blumenthal, who met Jones during a campus visit. "He was a free spirit, a pioneer of photography. It's gratifying that he wanted his collection here."</p>
<p>The work of Jones (1914-2009) and Baruch (1922-1997) has been exhibited at museums throughout the country, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution.&#160;</p>
<p>Some of their best known photographic series include <em>Berryessa Valley</em> (1956), <em>Haight Ashbury</em> (during the Summer of Love, 1967), <em>Black Panthers</em> (1968), and <em>Gate Five in Sausalito</em> (1969-765). The gift includes the transfer of all intellectual rights to their work.</p>
<p>Jones became acquainted with UC Santa Cruz in 1969, when he served as a teacher at a workshop held on campus by legendary photographer Ansel Adams.</p>
<p>"I was extremely pleased with the beauty of the campus," Jones said in a <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/01-06/pirkle_jones.html"><strong><em>2003 interview</em></strong></a>.&#160; "And the mood and the attitude there was something that I had never seen before. It is one of the most unique universities anywhere."</p>
<p>The Panther series of photographs came about in 1968 when his wife was introduced to Kathleen Cleaver, wife of Black Panther party leader Eldridge Cleaver. Given unprecedented access to the inner circle of the Black Panthers, Jones and Baruch took photographs from July through October of that year in an effort to create a better understanding of the controversial organization that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover once called "the greatest threat to the internal security of the United States."</p>
<p>"Ruth had made contact with the Black Panthers--Kathleen and Eldridge Cleaver," Jones recalled. "We would bring stacks of prints to them every week for use in their newspaper and for whatever else they wanted them for. At the time, everything in the press was negative and always out for shock value."</p>
<p>An exhibition of these photographs at San Francisco&#8217;s de Young Museum in 1968 drew more than 100,000 people despite nearly being canceled due to unfavorable press.</p>
<p>"The de Young exhibit was one of the most important events in my life," Jones said. "The energy we put into it--I&#8217;m amazed that we put it together in such a short time. It was a great opportunity."</p>
<p>The collection will be housed in <a href="http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/speccoll"><em><strong>McHenry Library&#8217;s Special Collections</strong></em></a>, where it will complement a smaller Jones/Baruch archive given to UC Santa Cruz in 2003. It joins a number of other exceptional photographs already held in the Library, including works by some of the West's most distinguished photographers such as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Victor Jorgensen, Erik Lauritzen, and Morley Baer.</p>
<p>"This gift is the result of a lot of effort on the part of three heads of Special Collections, two library development officers, three University Librarians and two chancellors,&#8221; noted University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell.&#160;&#8220;It also reflects the hard work of multiple special collections staff who have worked to make the current collection accessible. We can be very proud of this collaborative and sustained effort."</p>
<p>The new collection was just moved from storage in San Francisco to McHenry Library at the end of September. It filled three 24-foot trucks with more than 900 boxes of materials, as well as hundreds of framed items.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections and Archives at UC Santa Cruz, said that it will take at least two years for a project archivist, assisted by skilled graduate students, to process the collection. &#8220;Our goal is to provide access to the collection as quickly and accurately as possible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We will address research and loan requests as best we can while processing the collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have plans for exhibits at McHenry devoted to the Black Panthers in November of 2016 and The Summer of Love in 2017, plus traveling exhibits for 2018,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a very busy couple of years!&#8221;</p>
<p>Remak-Honnef noted that UC Santa Cruz has just loaned a number of prints from the collection to the <strong><em>Oakland Museum</em></strong> for their upcoming Black Panther show which opens on October 8. The Library also plans to loan items to the <strong><em>de Young Museum</em></strong> in San Francisco for their upcoming Summer of Love exhibition.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stories Pirkle and Ruth-Marion captured from the 1940s through the 1970s are just as relevant today as when they were created,&#8221; she observed.&#160; &#8220;We are grappling with the same issues of social, political and environmental justice. People are eager to engage with these issues, and appreciation for such beautiful photographs is timeless.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
 As many of you know, UCSC&#8217;s Transportation and Parking Services preserved many Metro routes that were set to be eliminated and increased the level of weekday service. TAPS has also increased shuttle service at peak times by reducing some service (weeknight Night Owl and downtown Bike Shuttle).<br/>
<br/>
 However, TAPS and Metro continue to refine service, particularly in light of a class schedule that was completely revised. We need your input.<br/>
<br/>
 Four student focus groups will take place over the next three weeks to solicit student input to help define student transit services for next year and beyond.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Palatino;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&#8226; Monday, October 3rd from 12-1pm<br/>
 &#8226; Thursday, October 6th from 6-7pm<br/>
 &#8226; Thursday, October 13th from 12-1pm<br/>
 &#8226; Tuesday, October 18th from 6-7pm<br/>
<br/>
 All focus groups will take place in the Baytree Conference Center (Cervantes and Velasquez room). Free pizza and beverages will be provided to those who <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3055601/Transit-Fee-Focus-Group-RSVP">register online</a> at least 24 hours in advance.<br/>
<br/>
 Over the summer, Metro staff worked with TAPS to develop a schedule to accommodate the revised class schedule. They are currently analyzing ridership data with the hope to fine-tune Metro&#8217;s UCSC service schedule for Winter Quarter. To assist in that process, they are soliciting feedback from riders when they are unable to board Metro buses due to capacity loads. Riders are encouraged to submit a <a href="http://scmtd.com/en/fares/customer-service/customer-service-report">Customer Service Report</a> detailing the route number, the bus stop location, and the date and time when this occurs.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Historically, ridership on both Metro and campus transit is about 15 percent greater during the first two weeks of Fall Quarter than the overall quarterly average. Based on that pattern, we expect to see fewer pass-bys in the weeks to come.<br/>

<p>During the ceremony, campus leaders will reflect on Rachel Carson and the history of the college. The hand-carved wood sign at the college&#8217;s entrance will be unveiled. Light refreshments will be served.</p>
<p>Speakers include Chancellor George Blumenthal, Rachel Carson College Provost Ronnie Lipschutz, and Senator Bill Monning, D-Carmel.</p>
<p>Later in the day, biographer William Souder, author of <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/on-a-farther-shore-by-william-souder.html?_r=3">On a Farther Shore</a></em>, will give a talk on Rachel Carson&#8217;s legacy. Souder will speak at 5 p.m. in the Music Recital Hall. The event is free and open to the public, though <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2412&amp;cid=4393">registration is requested</a>.</p>
<p>Carson, a writer and conservationist, is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. Her 1962 book, Silent Spring, dramatically chronicled the damage caused by indiscriminate application of chemicals in an attempt to control pests. Her larger theme: humans are a part of nature&#8212;not its masters.</p>
<p>The naming gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation recognizes Carson for her courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues. It establishes an endowment to ensure the college can provide research and educational opportunities for students in perpetuity and establishes a chair in ecology and environmental justice.

She's traveled roughly 10,000 kilometers so far and is expected to have covered 12,000 km by the time she arrives in January.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Two days after Phyllis Sooy died from colon cancer at age 75, her husband, Steve, found an email in his inbox.</p>
<p>The note was from Marcus Frost, new director of development for coastal sustainability at UC Santa Cruz, and said researchers at the campus&#8217;s Costa Lab had named two satellite-tagged northern elephant seals after Steve and Phyllis in thanks for a $200,000 graduate fellowship endowment Steve had established earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe the timing of it,&#8221; said Steve, who retired from a job with Arco in Northern California and now lives in Beaufort, S.C. &#8220;Having a northern elephant seal named after Phyllis was just too great.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened next was even better.</p>
<p>During the seals&#8217; annual eight-month migration, Phyllis, an 853-pound mother of two, set a record by swimming farther west than any other tracked elephant seal. Researchers at the lab run by Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Dan Costa have been tracking them for 22 years, according to Patrick Robinson, director of the A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve.</p>
<p>Swimming nearly to Japan, the seven-year-old Phyllis covered just shy of 6,000 km, or about 3,700 miles, of ocean before turning around and heading for home.</p>
<p>The average distance northern elephant seals usually swim during their eight-month migration is 3,257 km or about 2,023 miles, Robinson said.</p>
<p>By the time Phyllis the seal arrives back in California in January, she will have recorded a flipper-tiring 12,000-km, or 7,400-mile, foraging adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course,&#8217; I thought,&#8221; said Steve by telephone after he&#8217;d learned of Phyllis the seal&#8217;s record.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s very much what Phyllis would have done. In life, she was a go-getter. She one of those people who couldn&#8217;t sit still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before her death, Phyllis Sooy was a newspaper reporter and later a food service broker. She first met Steve through his late-wife, Rebecca, who was her college roommate. Phyllis was married to her high school sweetheart.</p>
<p>When Rebecca Sooy died of colon cancer in 2005, Phyllis &#8212; also a widow now &#8212; invited Steve to spend Christmas with her family.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized it was more than friendship,&#8221; Steve said.</p>
<p>Theirs became a household brimming with people: seven children, eighteen grandchildren and assorted guests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner could be anywhere from 8 and 20 people,&#8221; Steve said. &#8220;Nobody went hungry. Phyllis would make do. She didn&#8217;t get excited or upset or anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each winter for six years, Phyllis and Steve also would drive cross-country to visit their children before settling in Pescadero near UC&#8217;s A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve where Steve volunteered as a docent, regaling visitors with stories of northern elephant seals&#8217; remarkable return from near extinction when humans, in search of lamp oil, killed the marine mammals by the thousands.</p>
<p>The reserve is also where graduate and undergraduate researchers from UC Santa Cruz are working not only to unlock the secrets of these amazing animals and the ocean where they swim but have compiled what is arguably the largest marine mammal diving and tracking record on the planet, according to Robinson, who got his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>After Phyllis died, Steve said, he found it fun to track the flipper-equipped Phyllis across the ocean and tell people how it made sense that her namesake seal was a fast swimmer since Phyllis his wife always drove too fast.</p>
<p>This winter, he plans to once again drive across the country for his docent duties at A&#241;o Nuevo and hopes to be there to meet Phyllis the seal when she lumbers ashore in January.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Robinson said he&#8217;s happy to help out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to make a special effort to find Phyllis for Steve,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?tag_id=133774&amp;full=1&amp;lang=</url><title>To track Phyllis's journey, visit this site</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=1213</url><title>Tracking data for other elephant seals in the study</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.facebook.com/anonuevoresearch/</url><title>Check here for updates on the research at Año Nuevo Reserve </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=780&amp;dids=693&amp;bledit=1</url><title>Visit the giving page to contribute to research at Año Nuevo Reserve </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c3bb2bb80727017030a023dde457cd6"><name>bike-collision</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seeking community assistance — bicycle collision</title><start-date>1475305200000</start-date><display-name>Seeking community assistance — bicycle collision</display-name><path>/2016/10/bike-collision</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/bike-collision</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1475526503409</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475526547765</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>At 8:55 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 24, a solo bicycle collision occurred on Hagar Drive, just south of McLaughlin Drive, in the area of the Bay Tree Bookstore.

The more aware we are, the safer and more resistant and resilient we can be from cyber attacks when they occur.<br/>
<br/>
 With the growing potential for being a victim of cyber crime, practicing good cyber security is absolutely critical. Taking time to learn how to stay safer and more secure in our ever-expanding digital lives is one step we can each take to become more cyber aware. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 At UC Santa Cruz we focus on National Cyber Security Awareness Month by sharing simple ways to help you protect yourself online, along with actions to take if you are impacted by a breach, cybercrime, or other online issues.<br/>
<br/>
 This year, we highlight the following security awareness topics:<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Securing your digital life<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Cyber security in the workplace<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Protecting your mobile devices<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Don&#8217;t let identity theft happen to you</p>
<p>Throughout October, look for posters at campus mail stops, articles in Tuesday Newsday, Cyber Security training, and a prominent barn sign and campus banner. Please take time to read these timely messages.<br/>

<p>Her talk, &#8220;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Citizenship and the Politics of Exclusion,&#8221; begins at 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 6 at the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz. A reception will begin at 6:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public with <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2371&amp;cid=4328#imod%20signup">pre-registration requested</a>.</p>
<p>Anderson is professor of migration and citizenship and research director at the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and Society</p>
<p>&#8220;Bridget Anderson studies citizenship and the movement of&#160;people,&#8221; said Catherine Ram&#237;rez, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of the Chicano Latino Research Center. &#8220;My colleagues and I invited her&#160;to open our Sawyer Seminar on non-citizenship because of the sharp and&#160;innovative ways in which she&#160;questions and sheds light on the categories of&#160;citizen, migrant, and worker.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Anderson&#8217;s talk kicks off a year-long series that will explore what it means to be a citizen and non-citizen in a world made by migrants, refugees, guest workers, permanent residents, asylum seekers, slaves, prisoners, detainees, the stateless, and denizens (residents who do not hold the same rights as citizens). It is part of the John E. Sawyer Seminar on the Comparative Study of Culture funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and presented by the CLRC and the Institute for Humanities Research. &#160;</p>
<p>The series is organized around three themes: &#8220;Forced Migration&#8221; (fall 2016), &#8220;Labor Mobility and Precarity&#8221; (winter 2017), and &#8220;Fluidity of Status: Migrants, Citizens, Denizens&#8221; (spring 2017).&#160;</p>
<p>Anderson will explore citizenship as a legal status and moral claim. She&#160;examines how debates about migration expose the nature of the &#8220;good citizen&#8221; and the rise of the worker citizen. Rather than seeing migrants and citizens as competitors for privileges of membership, she&#160;argues for recognition of connections between the non-citizen migrant and the &#8220;failed citizen&#8221; on welfare or with a criminal record.</p>

Pending approval from UC President Janet Napolitano, this appointment will begin Dec. 1 and extend until we fill the position on a permanent basis. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/alison-galloway-stepping-down.html">As previously announced</a>, CP/EVC Alison Galloway is stepping down at the end of December; a national search for her successor is underway.<br/>
 <br/>
 As vice provost of academic affairs (VPAA), a position he has held since 2010, Professor Lee is well-positioned to take on this role. As VPAA, he is responsible for academic operations, including administration, planning, review, and development, and he advises the CP/EVC on resource allocation and personnel policy. He is also responsible for accreditation, online education, and the new Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning, and he serves as the campus diversity officer for faculty. The CP/EVC is responsible for all day-to-day academic and administrative operations of the campus, including budget and long-term planning.<br/>

 Herbie joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2002, after earning his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University and his B.S. from Yale University.<br/>

<p>The campus raised $75 million dollars&#8212;$68.2 million in outright gifts and pledges, and $7.1 million in planned gifts. Gifts and pledge payments totaled $69.2 million. These new commitments boost the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a> total to $286 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our comprehensive fundraising campaign continues to bring in much-needed revenue for our key priorities while also instilling the campus and its supporters with a culture of philanthropy,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s heartening to receive gifts big and small to support faculty, the student experience, and many other areas important to the campus mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The college endowment from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation renamed College Eight in honor of <a href="http://rachelcarson.ucsc.edu">Rachel Carson</a>, the writer and conservationist widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.</p>
<p>With matching funds from the UC Office of the President, additional gifts of $500,000 each from the Webster Foundation and alumnus Mark Headley and his wife, Christina Pehl, created two endowed chairs: the Robert Headley Presidential Chair for Integral Ecology and Environmental Justice, affiliated with Rachel Carson College and in honor of a longtime administrator at UCOP; and a Presidential Chair for the campus&#8217; Science Communication Program, which has trained hundreds of professional science writers who&#8217;ve gone on to work at the New York Times, Nature, and other leading publications.</p>
<p>The Marin Community Foundation donated the Pirkle Jones and Ruth Marion-Baruch Photography Collection, including more than 12,000 prints, 25,000 negatives, and hundreds of framed prints that will be accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Foundations, the greatest source of funding in FY16, gave $51 million to the campus, 74 percent of all gifts and pledge payments; alumni and friends contributed $11 million or 16 percent; and corporations gave $6.8 million, 9.8 percent. Research gifts generated $13.5 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Significant gifts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3.8 million bequest intention from a friend of the campus to support the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports dance program and for use at the chancellor&#8217;s discretion,</li>
<li>$2 million from the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/conservation-scholars.html">Doris Duke Charitable Foundation</a> to launch a conservation scholars program to increase diversity in the field;</li>
<li>$1 million from alumnus and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/nion-gift-ias.html">Chronicle Books CEO Nion McEvoy to support</a>) programming for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences; and</li>
<li>$1 million <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/genome-variation.html">grant from the Simons Foundation</a> to support development of a comprehensive map of human genetic variation &#8211; a critical new resource for both medical research and basic research in the life sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the campus launched its first Giving Day event, which led to more than 3,000 gifts to provide $340,000 to 65 projects across campus.</p>

<p><em>The <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a> supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future.

<p>Called &#8220;No Place Like Home&#8221; and led by sociology professors Miriam Greenberg and Steve McKay, the study grew out of &#8220;Working for Dignity,&#8221; McKay&#8217;s previous study of low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County. McKay said No Place Like Home will showcase findings from surveys of residents regarding housing in Santa Cruz, one of the most expensive areas in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will exhibit art work and new digital tools focusing on how local residents experience the housing crisis, as well as release preliminary results from a large-scale survey and interview project,&#8221; McKay said.</p>
<p>The study is the latest in on-going research funded by the UC Humanities Research Initiative and is an extension of <a href="http://workingfordignity.ucsc.edu/">Working for Dignity</a> conducted by the Center for Labor Studies, the Critical Sustainabilities Project, and the Chicano Latino Research Center.</p>
<p>Fifty-four UCSC students, working in coordination with Community Bridges, and other local community organizations, worked on the project. Forty fanned out over seven weeks in spring quarter to talk to residents in the Beach Flats, lower Ocean Street, and lower Pacific Avenue neighborhoods of Santa Cruz. McKay said many of the students are native Spanish speakers and conducted the door-to-door surveys in Spanish, focusing on neighborhoods that are typically undercounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The quality of the data is better,&#8221; McKay said.</p>
<p>Students used digital tablets and open-source software to collect and analyze the data. A total of 480 surveys were completed. Additionally, students returned for in-depth interviews with 29 residents. They took photos, designed maps, and created web sites to display the research results.</p>
<p>At the Oct. 13 event, students and community members will share stories, testimonies, and art work about creating a sense of "home" during a housing crisis. It will also include a discussion about issues facing renters in the community and look at possible steps forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great way to bring together students who are renters and the rest of Santa Cruz to address the housing crisis,&#8221; McKay said.</p>
<p>In winter quarter, McKay&#8217;s students will expand the project to Live Oak, and in spring to Watsonville, in order to build a database documenting the housing situation facing lower-income residents countywide.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/arias.html</url><title>Giving

grants</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="http://www.sccbg.org/">Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group</a> (SCCBG), a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care, has awarded grants of $12,500 each to four researchers at UC Santa Cruz: <strong>Angela Brooks</strong>, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering; <strong>Melissa Jurica</strong>, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology; <strong>Carrie Partch</strong>, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and <strong>Seth Rubin</strong>, professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>In the past, pilot projects funded by these small grants from SCCBG have enabled UCSC faculty to obtain preliminary results that led to much larger grants from the National Institutes of Health and other funding agencies.</p>
<p>Brooks will use the SCCBG grant to support her research on genetic changes in lung cancer that lead to altered gene processing. The variable editing of gene sequences (technically known as alternative mRNA splicing) enables one gene to produce a variety of different protein molecules. But aberrant splicing has been associated with cancer in recent studies. By investigating splicing changes in lung cancer, Brooks hopes to identify potential genetic targets for future therapies.</p>
<p>Jurica's lab also explores the role of mRNA splicing in cancer, focusing on the molecular machine that carries out the splicing, called the spliceosome. She will use SCCBG funding to study a key component of the spliceosome and how it interacts with inhibitor compounds. Her work is laying the groundwork for understanding how cancer mutations affect the functioning of the spliceosome and how splicing inhibitor compounds might be used in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Partch studies the biological clock that drives the daily ("circadian") rhythms of cells throughout the body, and her research is shedding light on the connection between clock disruption and cancer. The SCCBG grant will enable Partch to expand her research on a protein called PASD1 that inhibits clock activity and is expressed in many types of cancer. Her lab is developing techniques to identify circadian-based cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>Rubin's lab has initiated a new research project to develop cancer therapies that inhibit proteins called cell-cycle transcription factors by specifically targeting them for degradation. Transcription factors that activate genes for proliferation and other hallmarks of tumor cells are notoriously challenging to target with drugs. Rubin's strategy involves recruiting the cell's protein degradation machinery to target the transcription factors E2F and FoxM1.</p>
<p>The SCCBG has been supporting cancer research at UC Santa Cruz since 2005. The group holds several annual events to raise funds for the programs it supports.

<p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2016.1210171">Published in the journal <em>Memory</em></a>, Storm finds the internet is changing the way people learn, remember, and solve problems.</p>
<p>Storm researches human memory, with a special focus on the causes and consequences of forgetting. At his UCSC Memory Lab, he and his team explore the role of forgetting in resolving competition during retrieval, overcoming fixation in thinking and problem solving, updating autobiographical memory, and facilitating new learning.</p>
<p>Study participants were given a mix of questions that Storm and his collaborators took from a trivia book. Some were considered difficult, e.g. &#8220;Who was the king of England during the American Revolution&#8221; and others easy, e.g. &#8220;What is a baby goat called?&#8221;</p>
<p>One group was asked to answer the questions from memory while another group was told to use the internet to find the answers. Participants were then asked another set of questions, only this time the questions were slightly easier and they had the option of using Google if they wanted.&#160;</p>
<p>Storm found that participants who used the internet to answer the initial set of questions were more likely to use the internet to answer a second set. He also tested different conditions such as time and convenience. Storm found the effect still persisted, even when Google was a less-appealing option (participants had to get off a sofa and use an old, slow iPod touch instead of a desktop to access the search engine).</p>
<p>&#8220;At a general level, the findings suggest that using a particular information source&#8212;in this case, the internet&#8212;influences the likelihood of using that source again the future,&#8221; Storm writes.</p>
<p>But reliance might not be a bad thing, especially when accuracy is important, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, participants in the present research were more accurate in their responses to the trivia questions when they conducted a search than when they did not.&#8221;</p>

are.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<br/>
 At 5:40 a.m. on Oct. 4, UC Santa Cruz police officers responded to the bike rack area of College Nine and Ten apartments on a report of two suspicious males looking at bicycles. Police officers found two men, unaffiliated with UC Santa Cruz, with burglary tools and illegal knives. The two men told conflicting stories about why they were on campus. The two males, Conrad Smith, 51, of Santa Cruz, and Jason Meza, 48, of San Jose, were subsequently arrested for possessing burglary tools, illegal knives, and prowling.<br/>
<br/>
 In the back of the vehicle driven by the suspects, officers found and confiscated a red Specialized Hardrock mountain bike. It is believed that this bike may have been stolen (see photo attached). If this is your bike or you know whose bike it may be, please notify the UCSC Police Department by calling 831-459-2231, ext. 1.<br/>
<br/>
 Remember to always report suspicious people on campus so we can try to prevent crimes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone with information regarding who may be responsible for these thefts is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department immediately. The community is also encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity or persons by dialing 911 or 831-459-2231, ext. 1.<br/>
<br/>
 Report all in-progress crimes by calling 911 from any landline or cell phone. Reports may also be made by using one of the many "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Safety Tips</strong><br/>
 No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Report all suspicious persons, in-progress crimes, and emergencies to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Whenever possible, please remember to lock your vehicle and residence doors. Keep valuables secured and out of sight.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.</p>

<p>That changed for good&#8212;and for better&#8212;on Thursday with the dedication of Rachel Carson College, named for one of the great environmental prophets of the 20th century.</p>
<p>This is the first college UC Santa Cruz has named since Porter College 35 years ago. The naming also addresses a longstanding oversight in the current group of names for UC Santa Cruz colleges.</p>
<p>As Rachel Carson College Provost Ronnie Lipschutz noted, none until now has been named for a woman, &#8220;and none for a well-known female biologist and environmental scientist, and one who played a posthumous role in launching the modern environmental movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, as another speaker mentioned, Rachel Carson College is the first college across the entire UC system to be named for a woman.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silent Spring</em></strong></p>
<p>Carson, a marine biologist, is best known for <em>Silent Spring</em>, published on June 4, 1963, and completed while its author was in her mid-50s and dying of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The author William Souder, a recent biographer of Rachel Carson, spoke on campus the evening of the dedication. He has described <em>Silent Spring</em> as s a &#8220;cleaving point&#8221; when the &#8220;gentle, optimistic proposition called &#8216;conservation&#8217; began its transformation into the bitterly divisive idea that would come to be known as &#8216;environmentalism.'"</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em>, in a 50th anniversary retrospective, said the book&#8217;s oversized if unintentional influence on the environmental movement is comparable to the impact of Henry David Thoreau&#8217;s <em>Walden.</em></p>
<p><em>&#160;</em><em>Silent Spring</em> presented a view of nature that was shocking for its time&#8212;a nature that was far from a pastoral Eden immune to the actions of human beings. Instead, she portrayed a compromised nature where synthetic pesticides, such as DDT, held sway.</p>
<p>Instead of just destroying their intended targets, such as fungal blights or insect pests, these synthetic chemicals made their way into the food chain, wreaking havoc especially with bird and fish populations but threatening humans as well. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Robins falling from the sky</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal remarked on the shockingly direct ways that Carson showed the chemical devastation of wildlife. &#8220;She described robins dying of DDT that was sprayed to kill Dutch elm disease,&#8221; Blumenthal told the crowd, which ranged from young students and state assemblymembers to philanthropists and professors. &#8220;She described robins falling from the sky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson placed a strong emphasis on the way DDT often caused birds to lay weak-shelled eggs that shattered too early, decimating populations. Not surprisingly, birds were a constant reference point at the dedication ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for a flyover of brown pelicans at this dedication,&#8221; said state senator Bill Monning, referring to a bird that suffered severe DDT exposure until a ban on the chemical in the early 1970s led to a strong and self-sustaining population. &#8220;Maybe if we will it, they will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of birds, Blumenthal mentioned the way UC Santa Cruz scientists and their students have responded to Carson&#8217;s work with their own research, intervention, and advocacy. He noted that the campus played &#8220;a definitive role&#8221; in saving California&#8217;s peregrine falcon population from DDT-related decimation.</p>
<p>Blumenthal mentioned UC Santa Cruz biologist Ken Norris, who teamed up with Santa Cruz veterinarian James Roush to form the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group. In 1970 there were only two falcon pairs left in California, but the research effort&#8212;which involved perilous cliff climbs as well as recovered and incubated chicks&#8212;was such a success that the falcon was later removed from the endangered species list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students saw that environmental damage could be reversed,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;Rachel Carson would have loved that story.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Carson's legacy</strong></p>
<p>The naming gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation recognizes Carson for her courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues.</p>
<p>It establishes an endowment to ensure the college can provide research and educational opportunities for students in perpetuity and establishes a chair in ecology and environmental justice. Concurrently, citing the impact of Carson&#8217;s writings, a chair in science communication is also being created. The gift package totals $7 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could not think of anyone who would better embody the core values of UC Santa Cruz than this environmental pioneer,&#8221; said Alec Webster (Rachel Carson College '02, environmental studies), who attended the ceremony with his wife, Claudia. He mentioned that Carson had to overcome sexism and poverty, and grapple with illness, along with a constant threat of potential litigation, to get her message out to the world.</p>
<p>Just before the ceremony began, Jessica Schere (Rachel Carson College &#8217;19, bioengineering) talked about the various ways Carson continues to influence students. &#8220;My whole (first-year) core course revolved around Carson,&#8221; Schere said. &#8220;She was the first name that came to mind when we were talking about a name change. And I know several students who feel the same way. We are very passionate about Rachel Carson."</p>

 <br/>
 <em>Mothers of Men</em> includes some of the only surviving moving images of historic Santa Cruz. The restored feature-length silent film contains stunning footage of the city 100 years ago, featuring downtown streets, landmarks like Holy Cross Church and Piedmont House, as well as iconic structures that no longer exist, such as the Cooper House (destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake) and one of the rock arches from Natural Bridges State Park. <br/>
 <br/>
 The film was once assumed to be lost. But it was recently restored under the supervision of Santa Cruz native James Mockoski, a graduate of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Film &amp; Digital Media Department, who is also the longtime archivist for Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s American Zoetrope studio in San Francisco.<br/>
 <br/>
 Mockoski came across a print of the film in 1997 while working on his senior thesis project on film history in Santa Cruz County with UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp. Now, nearly two decades later, his dream of restoring the film has finally come true.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It&#8217;s been such a joy working with James on this project,&#8221; said Stamp. &#8220;He is equally passionate about film history and Santa Cruz history, and this project is a testament to his drive and determination.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;James found a print of the film, long assumed to be lost, while researching his senior thesis project 20 years ago. That, in itself, is amazing!&#160; After he became a professional film archivist, he never lost sight of his original dream to restore the film. His is an example of the extraordinary work our students do here, and the impact this work can have on the world at large,&#8221; she added.<br/>
 <br/>
 The restored film print had its premiere at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in June and was recently broadcast on Turner Classic Movies as part of its <em>Trailblazing Women</em> series. As part of the restoration, Mockoski commissioned a new score from the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, a five-piece chamber group noted for their silent movie scores. The ensemble will provide live accompaniment during the film&#8217;s screening in Santa Cruz.<br/>
 <br/>
 Stamp noted that <em>Mothers of Men</em> is a particularly interesting example of the kinds of films made about women&#8217;s suffrage in the years leading up to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Many of these films were either satiric comedies lampooning &#8216;mannish&#8217; suffragists or earnest dramas that portrayed heroic young women fighting for voting rights alongside national suffrage leaders,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;<em>Mothers of Men</em> is different. It by-passes the struggle for equal voting rights and confidently imagines a progressive future in which women not only vote, but serve as lawyers, judges, and eventually state governors.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Of course, all kinds of problems ensue where the heroine's personal life becomes entangled in her professional responsibilities,&#8221; Stamp added. &#8220;But the film raises questions that are still circulating in today&#8217;s presidential election: Can women provide effective political leadership without their heartstrings getting in the way? Do women bring a stronger moral compass to public office?&#160; How does the popular press treat women in elected office?"<br/>
 <br/>
 The film screening at the Del Mar Theater will include introductory remarks by Stamp and the film archivist. Doors open at 6:45 p.m. and the program begins at 7:15 p.m.<br/>
 <br/>
 The event is presented by the City of Santa Cruz with sponsorship from Landmark Theatres, UC Santa Cruz, the Museum of Art &amp; History and the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz. It is co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters, the Santa Cruz Film Festival and the Downtown Association. &#160;<br/>

<br/>
 Downs was in town to attend the UC Washington Center (UCDC), the University of California&#8217;s teaching and research program in the nation&#8217;s capital. Every quarter, nearly 300 UC students come to the center to participate in the city&#8217;s rich cultural, political, and international heritage through internships and seminars.<br/>
<br/>
 Downs was one of eight UCDC students to attend the debate held at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Earlier in the year, C-SPAN&#8217;s political editor and UCDC instructor Steven Scully devised a contest asking UCDC students to guess the presidential candidates&#8217; VP picks. The right answer would win a spot in the audience of the only VP debate in this year's election.<br/>
<br/>
 Downs correctly guessed Hillary Clinton&#8217;s running-mate, Tim Kaine.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;He was a good match for the ticket,&#8221; said Downs about about his educated guess of the Virginia senator. &#8220;He was from a Southern swing state, and was a possibility for Obama.&#8221; It was all luck from there. More correct guesses were submitted than tickets were available so eight students were selected randomly.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;After years of watching televised debates, it was surreal to be in the room,&#8221; he said about seeing the candidates battle face-to-face over issues from national security to the economy.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I could feel the tension.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;You are aware of the candidates&#8217; body emotions that are not available in TV cuts,&#8221; he said.<br/>
<br/>
 When Downs is not attending debates, he is interning at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research organization dedicated to Latin American and U.S./Canadian policy relations. He helps senior research fellows write articles and draft policy briefs. He is also taking a research seminar on international policy, a field he hopes to explore in more depth when he graduates.<br/>
<br/>
 While it may be hard to beat watching the debates in-person, Down says there is always something exciting to do at the center.<br/>
<br/>
 There are organized field trips to Arlington Cemetery and Mount Vernon, George Washington&#8217;s birthplace, night tours of Capitol Hill, plus other special events and lectures. This quarter, guest speakers include New York Times Congressional correspondent Jennifer Steinhauer. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Mexico&#8217;s Ambassador to the U.S. Carlos Sada, and Brian Lamb, founder of C-SPAN. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Many of our students do not have the personal or family connections to get access to these opportunities on their own,&#8221; says UCDC&#8217;s executive director Helen Shapiro.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Everyday I&#8217;m thankful for what the UC as a whole has provided me,&#8221; Downs said. &#8220;The personal growth is amazing.&#8221;</p>

Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Physics</a> by the <a href="http://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a> (APS).</p>
<p>Haber shares the prize with three fellow physicists: John Gunion at UC Davis, Gordon Kane at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Sally Dawson at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The award recognizes the four theoretical physicists for their "instrumental contributions to the theory of the properties, reactions, and signatures of the Higgs boson."</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is an important consequence of the theory that explains the properties of the weak nuclear force and the masses of the fundamental particles. In 1990, Haber and his fellow prize-winners coauthored a widely used book, <em>The Higgs Hunter's Guide</em>, known as a definitive and comprehensive guide to the physics of Higgs bosons.</p>
<p>Haber is well known for his role in developing extended theories of the Higgs boson and applying those theories to experiments in high-energy particle physics. The existence of the Higgs boson was predicted in 1964, but it wasn't until 2012 that physicists finally obtained solid evidence of its existence in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland. Extended theories that contain additional Higgs bosons (not yet discovered) are the basis for new particle searches now being performed at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p>The recipients of the Sakurai Prize will be honored at an APS meeting in Washington, D.C., in January 2017.</p>
<p>Haber went to MIT as an undergraduate and earned his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Michigan. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1984. A fellow of the American Physical Society, he received a prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Award in 2009. He is a member of the Particle Data Group, an international collaboration, and was elected as an honorary member of the Aspen Center for Physics in recognition of his extensive service.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b0836fdd80727017030a023de91aa512"><name>ramirez-ruiz-bouchet-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz honored by American Physical Society</title><summary>Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, will receive the 2017 Edward A.

Bouchet Award</a> from the <a href="http://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a>.</p>
<p>The Bouchet Award was established to recognize a distinguished minority physicist who has made significant contributions to physics research. Ramirez-Ruiz was chosen for the award in recognition of his "important contributions to the dynamics of plasma in extreme astrophysical environments."</p>
<p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz uses computer simulations to explore violent phenomena such as stellar explosions, gamma-ray bursts, and the accretion of material onto black holes and neutron stars. His research addresses fundamental questions in high-energy astrophysics and provides a framework for understanding the observational data coming from new telescopes and astronomical surveys.</p>
<p>The award, which will be presented at an APS meeting in Washington, D.C., in January 2017, also recognizes Ramirez-Ruiz for his efforts in advocating for more Hispanic students to enter astrophysics. In addition to giving an invited talk at the APS meeting, he will be invited to three academic institutions where the impact on minority students would be significant to deliver technical lectures and to talk informally with both faculty and students about research and teaching careers in physics.</p>
<p>Previous recipients of the award include noted theoretical physicists such as Juan Maldacena, Gabriela Gonzalez, and Jorge Pullin.</p>

<div>&#160;</div></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Student Raymond LeBeau, a member of the Pit River tribe, is honing his skills and his familiarity with environmental law at UC Santa Cruz in order to help tribal communities </article-subhead><article-text><p>For Raymond LeBeau and other members of the Pit River tribe, Medicine Lake in northeastern California is a sacred site, a place of healing.</p>
<p>But for the Bureau of Land Management and the Calpine energy company, the serene patch of blue that sits amid a volcanic landscape was a promising geothermal energy site.&#160; For more than 30 years, the Pit River tribe&#8212;including the young LeBeau and his family&#8212;protested the proposal, and, this year, a court ruled the energy-company leases had been made without proper environmental review or tribal consultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That (the prolonged fight) was what influenced me,&#8221; said LeBeau, 20, who is a member of the Illmawi band of the Pit River Nation and is majoring in environmental studies with a minor in philosophy at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;To see that played out as a kid, to be protesting and always having the threat of having our sacred site be developed and &#8230; desecrated, that really pushed me to say I want to stop that. I want to do what I can to protect our place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, LeBeau was given a $10,000 award as part of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians&#8217; Rodney T. Mathews Jr. scholarship program. His plan is to earn a Ph.D. in order to help tribal communities with environmental and land-use issues.</p>
<p>LeBeau, a Stevenson College student who plans to graduate in 2018, was born in Davis to a mother who practices Native American law and a father who is now director of the California Rural Indian Health Board. He likes to say his first ceremony was his time in the sweat lodge of his mother&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p>His parents made sure he learned the stories and participated in the ceremonies of his ancestors as he grew up, he says. His great aunt and uncle, who were part of the American Indian Movement and joined in the 19-month occupation of Alcatraz Island in the late '60s, also helped guide him. &#160;</p>
<p>Among the ceremonies was a trip to Saht-Tit-Lah, or Medicine Lake, as it was called later. There, he says, he was taught the proper way to enter and leave the water in order to find healing from the Creator who, according to oral histories, had bathed in the same waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to know your place, your homeland, and that goes with knowing where you come from,&#8221; says LeBeau, who describes the Pit River Indians as a resilient people who have known oppression and poverty. &#8220;What was instilled in me was that you are a guardian of the Earth, the guardian of your home and your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is where, according to LeBeau, he is learning to become a more effective guardian. He is honing his critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and communication skills as well as his familiarity with environmental law in order to be effectual within the system, he says. He is a leader in the People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC) on campus, an intern with the American Indian Resource Center, and is part of the Student Union Governance Board.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a member of PoCSC,&#8221; says Flora Lu, provost of Colleges Nine and Ten and associate professor of environmental studies, &#8220;Raymond is in the epicenter of conversations about the intersection of social justice and sustainability on campus, becoming more familiar with multiple viewpoints and ways in which different cultures build connection to place.&#8221;</p>
<p>His minor in philosophy, including readings of works by Native American author and theologian Vine Deloria Jr., has lent a depth to his understanding of the world from both a western and also a more indigenous, tribalistic viewpoint, he says.</p>
<p>The campus on the hill is also where he is exploring his identity more fully.</p>
<p>Sitting in a caf&#233; at McHenry Library, he tells the story of how hard it was being teased and called &#8220;Pocahontas&#8221; as a boy because of his long hair. But learning about ideas of normalcy prevalent in contemporary U.S. culture and juxtaposing those with the experiences of Indians&#8212;including his grandfather&#8212;who were forcibly taken to boarding schools where their hair was cut so they would be more &#8220;white,&#8221; made him &#8220;more passionate about my identity,&#8221; LeBeau says.</p>
<p>He pulls off a band securing hair that reaches nearly to his waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see my hair as a resistance against history and colonization,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is a reaffirmation of who I am and what my identity is.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b49011ce80727017030a023df0a14fb7"><name>bridgeman-memorial</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tribute to Bruce Bridgeman set for Nov. 5 on campus</title><summary>A tribute to Professor Bruce Bridgeman and his work is scheduled for 2-5:30 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 5 at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</summary><start-date>1476202500000</start-date><display-name>Bruce Bridgeman Memorial </display-name><path>/2016/10/bridgeman-memorial</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/bridgeman-memorial</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1476203121828</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1476204095123</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A tribute to Professor Bruce Bridgeman and his work is scheduled for 2-5:30 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 5 at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>

<p>An online information session will be <a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/workshops/">held at 3 p.m. Wednesday</a>. <a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/apply-2/">Pre-proposals are due</a> by Nov. 16.</p>
<p>Big Ideas provides up to $300,000 directly to students each year for their groundbreaking initiatives. Armed with the training and seed funding provided by Big Ideas, student teams have gone on to secure over $150 million in additional funding for their for-profit, nonprofit, or hybrid ventures.</p>
<p><a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/contests/uc-santa-cruz/">Several teams from UC Santa Cruz</a> have been among the past winners of Big Ideas.</p>
<p>For many students, Big Ideas serves as the first step in turning a dream into a viable product, service, or organization. Undergraduate and graduate students receive valuable feedback, work with mentors at the top of their fields, and have multiple opportunities to expand their professional networks.</p>
<p>In the 2016&#8211;17 contest, Big Ideas is bringing back its <a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/categories-eligibility/">eight categories</a> from last year: Art &amp; Social Change, Energy &amp; Resource Alternatives, Financial Inclusion, Food Systems, Global Health, Improving Student Life, Information Technology for Society, and Scaling Up Big Ideas, for past winners only.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s contest also features a brand new category: Hardware for Good. Spearheading this new and exciting partnership with the Autodesk Foundation, Big Ideas is helping leverage the &#8220;Hardware Revolution&#8221; for social benefit. In essence, the category is responding to a unique opportunity within today&#8217;s innovation space. 3D printing, CAD software and makerspaces have dramatically decreased the price of prototyping and manufacturing physical goods, creating more space for at-home entrepreneurs to develop hardware solutions. The opportunity to develop solutions for lower-resourced communities are endless, as hardware innovations can now be prototyped faster, cheaper, and more conveniently than ever.</p>
<p>Proposals submitted to the Hardware for Good category can encompass everything from wearable technologies and assistive technologies to novel devices that improve productivity, efficiency and safety for consumers, small business, industry, and the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b511bb0d80727017030a023dd06b9c02"><name>bike-theives-caught</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community assistance leads to three arrests</title><summary>We want to thank the UC Santa Cruz community for reporting suspicious activity that led to the arrests of three suspected bicycle thieves Friday, Oct. 7.</summary><start-date>1476082800000</start-date><display-name>Community assistance leads to three arrests</display-name><path>/2016/10/bike-theives-caught</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/bike-theives-caught</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1476211619052</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1476211697389</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We want to thank the UC Santa Cruz community for reporting suspicious activity that led to the arrests of three suspected bicycle thieves Friday, Oct. 7.<br/>
<br/>
 At 6:20 p.m., officers responded to Merrill College for a report of two suspicious individuals attempting to steal bicycles.&#160; Officers arrived and subsequently arrested Ryan Flynn, 38, of Santa Cruz and Steven Godwin 44, also of Santa Cruz, on suspicion of possession of controlled substances, burglary tools, and illegal knives, also prowling and multiple outstanding warrants.<br/>
<br/>
 At 8:25 p.m., officers responded to Rachel Carson College for a suspicious person attempting to steal a bicycle. Officers arrived and subsequently arrested Solomon Mitchell, 42, of Santa Cruz, on suspicion of attempted petty theft. In addition, officers confiscated a bicycle in Mitchell's possession. The bicycle has since been claimed by its owner.</p>
<p>Bicycle registration is a quick and convenient way that can help in the return of a bike if stolen. The Santa Cruz Police Department offers a free online bicycle registration program at <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/departments/police/bicycle-license-registration">http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/departments/police/bicycle-license-registration</a>.</p>
<p>With your help we can continue to deter these types of activities from occurring on campus and hold those responsible if they do occur. Remember to always report suspicious people on campus to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department so we can try to prevent crimes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
 Report all in-progress crimes by calling 911 from any landline or cell phone. Reports may also be made by using one of the many "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Safety tips</strong><br/>
 No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Report all suspicious persons, in-progress crimes, and emergencies to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911.</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;</li>
<li>Whenever possible, please remember to lock your vehicle and residence doors. Keep valuables secured and out of sight.&#160;</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;</li>
<li>Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Campus resources</strong><br/>
 For students, a range of support services is also available through the Cowell Student Health Center, including personal counseling through Counseling and Psychological Services and support through a Confidential Victim Advocate.<br/>
<br/>
 For employees, the Employee Assistance Program can provide personal counseling and support.<br/>

<p>Most importantly, the committee aims to solicit feedback from the students on how the campus should move forward. The committee invites all students to attend the event. Drinks and food will be provided.</p>
<p>Last spring, <a href="../05/athletics-poll.xml">63 percent of UCSC undergraduates</a> voted &#8220;yes&#8221; when asked whether they would be willing to pay $90 per quarter to support NCAA athletics on campus. Although the opinion poll was nonbinding, this demonstrated significant support for athletics in an campus election with a record 43 percent turnout.</p>
<p>The Special Committee on Athletics, formed in the spring of 2015 in response to the potential elimination of NCAA sports, made an initial report to the Academic Senate and administration just before the student elections and is currently at work on a plan for a sustainable budget for athletics at UCSC, which will likely include a vote this spring about funding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bade662080727017030a023d7d8acf7a"><name>holiday-photo-contest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On-campus photography contest</title><summary>The Chancellor’s Office and University Relations are sponsoring a contest to choose a photograph of UC Santa Cruz for Chancellor Blumenthal’s winter holiday card.

<p>The Packard Fellowship, one of the nation's most prestigious honors for early-career scientists, gives Foley $875,000 over the next five years to support his research on the mysterious "dark energy" that is causing the expansion of the universe to speed up. Foley plans to use precise observations of exploding stars to better understand the properties of dark energy.</p>
<p>"Ryan is one of the top young astronomers in the world," said Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. "He has an exceptional research portfolio in the area of cosmology and high-energy astrophysics. We count ourselves lucky to have his vision, energy, and charisma in the department."</p>
<p>Dark energy was discovered through observations of a particular type of exploding star, called type 1a supernovae. The predictable brightness of these stellar explosions makes them useful for measuring cosmic distances. But more precise measurements are needed to probe the nature of dark energy and determine if it is constant or variable over time. Foley is leading two supernova survey projects designed to bring supernova cosmology to a new level.</p>
<p>"Dark energy accounts for roughly 70 percent of the universe, yet we know barely anything about it," Foley said. "These new surveys should improve our knowledge of the nature of dark energy far beyond previous efforts."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Nearby supernovae</strong></p>
<p>Foley is working to get better observations of nearby supernovae. For years, astronomers have focused most of their efforts on the distant universe to record observations of the faintest, most distant supernovae. Because it takes billions of years for light from distant objects to reach our telescopes, observing distant supernovae provides a look back in time and allows astronomers to study the history of the universe's expansion. According to Foley, however, the biggest problems in supernova cosmology currently relate to nearby supernovae.</p>
<p>"It's funny how the problem is inverted now, and the hard thing is to get good observations of the nearby universe," he said. "Currently, the sample of nearby type 1a supernovae is a larger source of uncertainty in cosmology experiments than the distant sample."</p>
<p>One reason is that the number of nearby galaxies is limited, and surveying them for supernovae requires searching large areas of the sky. In contrast, deep observations of a relatively small patch of sky can explore a large volume of the distant universe (just as your hand at arm's length covers a much larger area of the sky than the moon, yet the moon is vastly larger than your hand).</p>
<p>With modern telescopes and survey projects, the rate of discovery of supernovae has grown exponentially in recent years. Foley and a small team launched the Foundation Supernova Survey in 2015 using the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, which has the largest digital camera in the world (1.4 billion pixels) and is extremely well calibrated. Because comparing brightness measurements is so crucial to supernova cosmology, precise calibration of the telescope system is essential. Pan-STARRS has already observed the entire sky visible from Hawaii, providing necessary reference images, and Foley was part of an earlier collaborative project that used Pan-STARRS to observe about 3,000 distant supernovae.</p>
<p>"Pan-STARRS is the only system with supernovae at all distances, so we can directly compare all supernovae on the exact same system, eliminating cross-system calibration uncertainties," Foley said.</p>
<p>His other project, the Swope Supernova Survey, will complement the Foundation Survey with more detailed observations of individual supernovae. Foley is working with astronomers from the Carnegie Observatories to use the Swope Telescope at Las Campanas, Chile, which will enable him to obtain detailed "light curves" showing how the brightness of a supernova rises and then fades away over time.</p>
<p>"The combination of these two surveys will allow us to make the best dark energy measurements to date," he said.</p>
<p>Foley is the 12th UCSC faculty member, and fifth UCSC astronomer, to receive a Packard Fellowship, awarded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to support young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity. It is one of the nation's largest nongovernmental fellowships, designed to allow maximum flexibility in how the funding is used. Packard Fellows are encouraged to take risks and explore new frontiers in their fields.</p>
<p>Foley received his bachelor's degree in math, physics, and astrophysics from the University of Michigan and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in astrophysics from UC Berkeley. In 2015, he received a Sloan Research Fellowship. He came to UC Santa Cruz from the University of Illinois in 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/conservation-and-science/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/fellows-highlights/2016-packard-fellowships-science-engineering-awarded-eighteen-researchers/</url><title>Packard Foundation announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c46c4fb180727017030a023da3e67e70"><name>emergencies-disasters</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Be smart about emergencies and disasters</title><summary>We want your experience here at the campus of UC Santa Cruz to be a safe and enjoyable one.

In the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains, the campus is one of the most stunning and beautiful locations in the central coast of California. From the redwood forests to the scenic beaches, we are sure you will enjoy the many activities living in Santa Cruz provides.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, living in such a captivating place can also have its perils. The Santa Cruz mountain range is home to two of the largest fault lines in California. The drought has created conditions favorable to wildfires. And the cold ocean, large waves, and strong tides, not to mention the possibility of tsunamis, make beach-going a potentially dangerous experience. More information regarding ocean safety can be <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/departments/parks-recreation/community-facilities/santa-cruz-wharf/wharf-feature-stories/ocean-safety">found online</a>.</div>

<div></div>
<div>This storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall and high winds. The NWS has issued advisories for coastal flooding and high surf.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As the first significant storm of the winter, this is a good opportunity to review storm preparedness information and resources. During any storm event, it is important to take steps for your own safety.&#160;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Use caution when outdoors during high wind and thunderstorm activity. Be aware of overhead hazards such as tree limbs and power lines.&#160;</li>
<li>Never approach a downed wire, even if it is not actively arcing or sparking. Report all downed wires to 911.&#160;</li>
<li>Allow extra time during commute periods to account for wet roadways, heavy traffic, and accidents. Drive cautiously and leave extra space when following to allow for increased braking distances in wet conditions. Remember that California state law requires headlights to be on during all periods of rain.&#160;</li>
<li>Do not attempt to drive or walk through flooded areas.&#160;</li>
<li>Bicyclists and motorcyclists should use lights and wear retroreflective rain gear or vests to ensure that they are visible.&#160;</li>
<li>Take steps to prepare your home. Ensure that your gutters are clear and that any loose exterior furniture or other items which may become airborne during heavy wind are properly secured.&#160;</li>
<li>If you have low-lying areas that are subject to flooding, take steps to mitigate these issues such as using sandbags.&#160;</li>
<li>Have flashlights and lanterns available in the event of a power outage, and be sure that they have fresh batteries.&#160;</li>
<li>Never use charcoal or propane fueled devices such as grills, heaters, or lanterns inside. These present both a fire hazard as well as a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>

<p>Published as part of the THE World University Rankings 2015&#8211;16, the analysis, measured overall research influence based on the average number of citations per paper, using a database of more than 56 million citations to 11.9 million research publications published over five years, from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>For the first time this year, more than half a million books and book chapters have been included in the analysis, meaning that arts and humanities research is better represented than ever before. This year&#8217;s ranking includes institutions from 79 countries and represents an elite 5 percent of the world&#8217;s higher education institutions.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 99.8, UC Santa Cruz is tied for fourth place with UC Berkeley and California Institute of Technology. St. George&#8217;s University of London ranked first. Other institutions with high citation scores were Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both with scores of 99.9.</p>
<p>In describing their methodology, THE editors have called the evaluation of research influence their &#8220;flagship&#8221; indicator. As <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/methodology-world-university-rankings-2016-2017">explained on the website</a> for the World University Rankings, &#8220;the citations help to show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to expand the boundaries of our understanding, irrespective of discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s overall ranking in the THE World University Rankings for 2015&#8211;16 was 146 out of 980 institutions worldwide. In the United States, UC Santa Cruz ranked 53 out of 148 institutions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c58d68e180727017030a023dc2a56759"><name>warburton-dance-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Theater Arts professor Ted Warburton wins national dance award</title><summary>Edward (Ted) Warburton, professor of dance and associate dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz, is the recipient of the National Dance Education Organization’s 2016 Outstanding Dance Researcher Award.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, edward warburton, ucsc arts division, dance, ndeo</keywords><start-date>1476488700000</start-date><display-name>Theater Arts professor Ted Warburton wins national dance award</display-name><path>/2016/10/warburton-dance-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/warburton-dance-award</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1476488160118</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1476489339964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/warburton-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/warburton-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>warburton-350.jpg</name><display-name>warburton-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>91088</file-size><width>350</width><height>351</height></image><image-alt>Edward (Ted) Warburton, professor of dance and associate dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/warburton-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/warburton-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>warburton-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>warburton-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21148</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Edward (Ted) Warburton, professor of dance and associate dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Edward (Ted) Warburton, professor of dance and associate dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Edward (Ted) Warburton, professor of dance and associate dean of the arts at UC Santa Cruz, is the recipient of the National Dance Education Organization&#8217;s 2016 Outstanding Dance Researcher Award.</p>
<p>The biennial award is given to the individual who has made outstanding and sustained contributions to the field of dance through creative and scholarly research.</p>
<p>Warburton was recognized for &#8220;his rigorous research, national profile, and significant impact internationally.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his nomination letter, a senior dance scholar noted that &#8220;I always assign Warburton&#8217;s work for my students to read because it supports content in the curriculum that I teach, as well as the values of critical thinking, clear writing, and a deep ethical grounding that I endeavor to cultivate&#8230;he is generally considered to be among the top five scholars in the dance world today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Dance Education Organization (NDEO) is a nonprofit, membership organization dedicated to advancing dance education centered in the arts. NDEO provides the dance artist, educator and administrator a network of resources and support, a base for advocacy and research, and access to professional development opportunities that focus on the importance of dance in the human experience.</p>
<p>Warburton&#8217;s received the award at the organization&#8217;s 2016 national conference in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m deeply honored to be recognized in this way,&#8221; said Warburton. &#8220;I appreciate the fact that the award recognizes not only my research and writing on dance cognition and instruction, but also my abiding interest and work in practice-led research.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/05/warburton-dance.html</url><title>So You Think When You Dance?</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c596b62180727017030a023d0f4ecc89"><name>housing-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community gathers to strengthen public dialogue about Santa Cruz’s housing crises</title><summary>New research by UC Santa Cruz sociology professors Miriam Greenberg and Steve McKay highlights housing issues</summary><keywords>housing, crisis, sociology, research, affordability</keywords><start-date>1476460800000</start-date><display-name>Housing</display-name><path>/2016/10/housing-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/housing-research</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1476488769558</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1476720611741</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/miriam-steve-400px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/miriam-steve-400px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>miriam-steve-400px.jpeg</name><display-name>miriam-steve-400px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>61677</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Professors talking</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/interactive-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/interactive-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>interactive-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>interactive-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>4542</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Interactive display</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Sociology professors Miriam Greenberg and Steven McKay surveyed 435 residents in some of Santa Cruz&#8217;s poorest neighborhoods to examine the consequences of the housing crisis on renters.

It is one of the most unaffordable cities in in the country because of escalating housing costs and stagnant wages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Housing affects everyone, but it does not affect everyone equally,&#8221; said sociology professor Steve McKay at a public presentation he led about housing problems in Santa Cruz county on Oct. 13.</p>
<p>More than 400 community members packed the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History to hear preliminary findings from a housing study McKay is conducting with Miriam Greenberg, also a professor in sociology.</p>
<p>The event also kicked off Affordable Housing Week, a series of events to highlight and help people impacted by a lack of affordable housing in the area.</p>
<p>The study, titled <em>No Place Like Home</em>, sets out to address crucial questions surrounding housing, especially for renters. What does it mean to feel &#8220;at home&#8221; during an affordable housing crisis? What are the sacrifices of high rents?</p>
<p>Greenberg and McKay&#8217;s initial discoveries are devastating. Overcrowding, exorbitant rent burden, evictions, and fear of retaliation are some of the results that can be accessed on the <a href="http://www.noplacelikehomeucsc.org">project&#8217;s bilingual multimedia website</a>.</p>
<h3>Census of the invisible: researching the under-researched</h3>
<p>Phase one of the project focused on Beach Flats, Lower Ocean, and Lower Pacific/ Laurel Streets, areas known for higher-than-average crime rates, dense urbanization, and poverty. This population is also difficult to reach, said McKay. For various reasons, residents may not respond to telephone and census surveys.</p>
<p>In many cases, they may not get asked at all and therefore remain uncounted, McKay added. Greenberg, McKay, and more than 50 student researchers surveyed 435 residents to create was McKay calls a &#8220;census of the invisible.&#8221;</p>
<p>To connect community with their research, students spent time getting to know local residents, who are predominantly Hispanic and Latino. The students helped with neighborhood cleanups, organized a health fair, and even hosted a kids movie night. These efforts helped build trust and rapport with survey participants. Meaningful relationships were built, which meant meaningful data could be collected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need the community engaged to get the real numbers,&#8221; said sociology student Alma Villa.</p>
<h3>More than numbers</h3>
<p>Of the 435 survey respondents, 51 percent were Latino, 57 percent earned less than $30,000, 45 percent experienced a forced move in the last five years, and 32 percent reported overcrowding, defined as having more than two persons per bedroom.</p>
<p>73 percent of survey respondents experienced rent burden, defined by the American Community Survey as spending more than 30 percent of one&#8217;s gross income on rent and utilities.</p>
<p>But for 27 percent, more than 70 percent of wages go towards their housing. 80 percent of respondents who are rent burdened are Latino.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not just graphs and numbers but lives of human beings and real people in your community,&#8221; said sociology major Celeste Covarrubias-Marcias, who described the cramped living conditions she witnessed. She reported seeing makeshift beds in kitchens, cramped units, and parents worried about their children&#8217;s well-being.</p>
<p>63 percent reported dealing with major problems such as fears of neighborhood safety, rowdy neighbors, and poorly maintained buildings. Sociology student Katie Marlow saw homes infested with rodents, cockroaches, and bedbugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home is not just shelter,&#8221; Covarrubias-Marcias emphasized. &#8220;It is comfort, belonging, and feeling safe.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Housing as an environmental concern</h3>
<p>The problem of housing is also a social and ecological problem, said Greenberg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lack of affordable housing is a sustainability issue,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Greenberg pointed to the environmental cost of urban sprawl. As the lack of affordable housing pushes residents out, environmental problems are brought in. More people commuting means more cars on roads and more greenhouse gas emissions. More paved roads on the urban fringe is also of broader ecological concern, as asphalt prevents the natural seepage of rainwater, thus reducing our groundwater, and also fragments wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>Yet when sustainability is introduced into development plans, it tends not to include affordability resulting in contradictory effects.</p>
<p>While urban sustainability efforts have helped transform areas like San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Santa Cruz into greener and more environmentally-friendly places, it has also made them more desirable and the kicker: more expensive. Poor and low income residents are pushed out again.</p>
<p>To address &#8220;green displacement,&#8221; social equity needs to be a central part of the discussion. Sustainability without affordability is not sustainable, Greenberg said.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Phase two of No Place Like Home begins in January. Greenberg and McKay will focus on Live Oak. Phase 3 will start in April 2017 in Watsonville.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz residents are also encouraged to share their story on the project&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>The winning games were <a href="http://www.badnewsgame.com/"><em>Bad News</em></a>, which won the Audience Choice Award, and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/project/threadsteading/"><em>Threadsteading</em></a>, which won the Technology Award.</p>
<p>"There are only nine awards given out to games, so this is an amazing percentage," said Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><em>Bad News</em>, developed by graduate students Ben Samuel, James Ryan, and Adam Summerville, uses artificial intelligence to simulate the history of a fictional small town and combines gameplay with improvisational theater. The player must accomplish a task by interacting with townspeople in a live performance, with actors playing the townspeople and using the simulation to guide their improvisations.</p>
<p>Graduate student April Grow was a core member of the team that developed <em>Threadsteading</em> at <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh, where she was an intern. UCSC alumna Gillian Smith was also on the team, and Grow and Smith both represented the game at IndieCade. <em>Threadsteading</em> is a two-player game played entirely on a modified quilting machine, and each round of the game results in a permanent physical artifact: a quilt.</p>

 <br/>
 UC Santa Cruz Satellite Reef is part of the worldwide Crochet Coral Reef project by twin sisters Margaret and Christine Wertheim and their Los Angeles-based organization, the Institute For Figuring. The project has been exhibited worldwide in both art and science museums, and is now one of the largest participatory science and art endeavors in the world. <br/>
 <br/>
 Mixing crocheted yarn with plastic trash, the Crochet Coral Reef fuses mathematics, marine biology, art, and craft to produce large-scale coralline landscapes--both beautiful and blighted.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It offers a unique response to the dual calamities facing marine life--climate change and plastic trash,&#8221; noted IAS director John Weber. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It turns out the crocheting is a remarkably effective method to create precisely the kinds of hyperbolic geometries that coral reefs display,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This was discovered by Cornell University mathematician Dr. Daima Taimina. The Wertheim sisters use hyperbolic crochet organically in their project which has been shown in 20 countries and has had more than 8,000 participants. And now it comes to Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The Wertheims will participate in student-led workshops to introduce the project and teach the techniques of hyperbolic crochet. The public is invited and no prior crochet experience is necessary. <br/>
 <br/>
 Their visit is sponsored by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences in preparation for its exhibition of the traveling Crochet Coral Reef in February 2017 at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery. It will feature a selection of dramatic coral sculptures created over the project's long history.<br/>
 <br/>
 There also will be a UC Santa Cruz Satellite Reef exhibition at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, which will be crocheted by the Santa Cruz community on and off campus between now and its opening in May 2017. The UC Santa Cruz Satellite Reef is the newest addition to the Institute For Figuring&#8217;s worldwide reefing network. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This project, spearheaded by IAS, was inspired by UC Santa Cruz professor emerita Donna Haraway&#8217;s writings on the stunning crocheted response to global warming and its devastating effects on living reefs,&#8221; Weber noted.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Spectacularly beautiful, artistically complex, and socially powerful, the work brings people together around a devastating ecological challenge&#8212;the survival of the coral reefs and marine ecologies throughout the world. UC Santa Cruz is thrilled to be part of this galvanizing project,&#8221; he added. <br/>
 <br/>
 Since its first public showing in 2006, the Institute For Figuring&#8217;s Crochet Coral Reef has been seen by over half a million viewers. In addition, Satellite Reefs have been hosted in cities across the United States, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. <br/>
 <br/>
 The night before the opening workshop, Margaret Wertheim will also participate in the Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center titled &#8220;Understanding Coral Reefs Through Marine Science and Woolly Sculptures.&#8221; She will be part of a diverse panel that will provide a unique perspective on corals, conservation, and crochet craftwork. <br/>

<p>Three UC Santa Cruz politics professors offer brief insights based on their point-of-view and expertise:</p>
<h3>War looms large</h3>
<p><strong>Ronnie D. Lipschutz</strong><br/>
 Professor of politics<br/>
 Provost, Rachel Carson College</p>
<p>&#8220;This appears to be a fairly important election so far as U.S. foreign policy and global politics are concerned.&#160; War, in particular, looms large, and not only in the Middle East.&#160; Hillary Clinton has the experience and the knowledge to do well in foreign affairs and diplomacy, although she has not really offered anything innovative in terms of U.S. involvement in wars abroad.&#160;</p>
<p>"Donald Trump has been fairly incoherent: he wants to pursue something of an "America First!" policy even as he wants other countries to follow the American lead, pay our bills and fight our wars.&#160; We think the president has a rather free hand in foreign affairs; what Barack Obama and many other U.S. presidents have discovered is that, in fact, there are major constraints on that freedom (George W. Bush was an exception, but 9/11 offered a wide window of opportunity to invade Afghanistan and Iraq).&#160; No reason to think this will change very much, whomever is elected.&#8221;</p>
<h3>China&#8217;s perspective</h3>
<p><strong>Benjamin L. Read</strong><br/>
 Associate professor of politics<br/>
 Director of graduate studies</p>
<p>&#8220;China has watched the U.S. election with amusement and fascination. On the one hand, Donald Trump frequently criticizes China, and calls for a tougher trade policy toward Beijing. On the other hand, Trump has questioned the U.S. commitment to longstanding alliances, including those with Japan and South Korea, and China likes the prospect of an isolationist America that would give it a freer hand in East and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>"Hillary Clinton is of course much more of a known quantity to China. It doesn&#8217;t care for her occasional advocacy of human rights and her favoring the U.S. &#8220;pivot to Asia&#8221; when she was secretary of state, but it knows it can do business with her and wouldn&#8217;t expect fundamental change under a Clinton administration.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Culmination of Republican politics</h3>
<p><strong>Daniel Wirls</strong><br/>
 Professor of politics</p>
<p>&#8220;However much we focus on the seemingly unique aspects of Donald Trump and his candidacy, he is, at the same time, the culmination of the style of politics the Republican Party has been practicing since at least 1994. He is almost a caricature of the demagogue the founders warned us against, but his path to power was well-paved.</p>
<p>"One consequence of his candidacy is that the nation is having even less of a substantive conversation about critical issues than even the typically impoverished presidential campaigns of the past. We concentrate on his endless stream of nonsensical or outrageous remarks, and Hillary Clinton is happy to have us do so.</p>
<p>"And even some of the few issues discussed are beside the point. As an example, the candidates were asked during the first debate about &#8220;no first use&#8221; of nuclear weapons. That has no importance next to the fact that the U.S. is embarking&#8212;without any debate in any forum&#8212;on a top-to-bottom reconstruction of its nuclear arsenal that could cost $1 trillion over 30 years.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d52ed2a080727017030a023d4c9e8036"><name>wills-guide</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Free guide to wills available to UC Santa Cruz community</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Office of Planned Giving is offering a free wills guide to help members of the UC Santa Cruz community with estate planning.</summary><start-date>1476750300000</start-date><display-name>Wills guide</display-name><path>/2016/10/wills-guide</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/wills-guide</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1476750396700</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1476810921313</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Office of Planned Giving is offering a <a href="https://ucsc.giftlegacy.com/?DID=1884&amp;pageID=19">free wills guide</a> to help members of the UC Santa Cruz community with estate planning.</p>

<p>The need for this support has never been greater. A recent survey by the UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Nutrition Policy Institute found that four in 10 UC students are food insecure, reflecting the rising cost of college and a challenging financial climate for many students.</p>
<p>With both World Food day, Oct. 16, and National Food Monday, Oct. 24, the campus Food Access and Basic Needs Committee is focused on ensuring students know resources are available to them, and that they&#8217;re not alone in their efforts to cover the costs of attendance. &#8220;It&#8217;s a struggle facing college students around the state and across the U.S.," said Tim Galarneau of CASFS, who co-chairs UC&#8217;s GFI Food Access and Security Subcommittee.</p>
<h3>New and expanded programs in place</h3>
<p>At Hahn Student Services on campus, students this year will find a much-expanded version of the former &#8220;snack closet.&#8221; &#8220;The student food pantry is now registered as a food distribution center with Second Harvest Food Bank,&#8221; Galarneau said.&#160;</p>
<p>The food pantry, located on Hahn&#8217;s second floor and now open 9 a.m.&#8211;5 p.m. weekdays and by appointment, features a new cold storage unit purchased with GFI funds where students can pick up perishable items and fresh, organic produce, along with dry goods and some toiletry items. From organic potatoes grown by students for students on the UC Santa Cruz Farm to dried beans, soups, and non-food items, such as deodorant and shampoo, there are items to nourish and support students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re also working to get some fresh, prepared local, seasonal meals that can be heated and served,&#8221; Galarneau said. &#8220;We realize that although it&#8217;s important for students to learn cooking skills, they don&#8217;t always have time to cook from scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judy Xie, a 2015-2016 GFI Fellow and FSWG student leader, helped expand the Swipes Program to the UCSC campus as another option for students facing food budget challenges. Initiated at UCLA, the program lets students donate their unused meal plan dollars to Slug Support. &#8220;Students who don&#8217;t have meal plans can have the funds added to their student IDs,&#8221; explains Xie. &#8220;They can use them at the dining halls and there&#8217;s no special voucher or anything you have to present, so there&#8217;s no stigma attached.&#8221; Colleges, Housing and Educational Services (CHES) Vice Chancellor Sue Matthews, and UCSC Dining Services Director Bill Prime worked with Judy Xie and Slug Support to ensure the software and program success is prioritized.&#160;</p>
<p>The popular organic produce &#8220;Pop-Up&#8221; is also open for business again. Run by FSWG interns who team with CASFS staff from the UCSC Farm, this weekly produce stand operates noon&#8211;4 p.m. Wednesdays in Quarry Plaza. The Pop-Up offers organically grown produce from the UCSC Farm and other local, organic farms. Produce not sold that day goes to help stock the shelves in the student food pantry at Hahn.</p>
<p>Galarneau explained that the UCSC Farm will soon add two &#8220;high tunnels&#8221; (greenhouse-like structures to cover some of the farm beds) to expand year-round production for the Pop-Up and food pantry, as well as the campus dining halls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high tunnels would allow us to grow a number of crops all winter long, including cooking greens such as bok choy and tatsoi to dino kale and salad mix,&#8221; said farm production manager Kirstin Yogg Comerchero.</p>
<h3>CalFresh available to qualified students</h3>
<p>Slug Support is also working to sign up students who qualify for the CalFresh program, which provides SNAP/EBT benefits (formerly known as food stamps).</p>
<p>&#8220;CalFresh is a much underused program in California, in part because a lot of people aren&#8217;t aware they qualify,&#8221; said Mario Gonzalez, Slug Support staff and recent UCSC graduate who explains that the benefits don&#8217;t affect a student&#8217;s financial aid or award package.</p>
<p>Qualified students can get up to $200 a month to use at local farmers&#8217; markets and grocery stores. &#8220;At the weekly Pop-Up, you can double your purchasing power using SNAP as we offer $10 in matching funds when a student uses $10 of their CalFresh allotment, &#8221; Galarneau said.</p>
<h3>Slug Support offers assistance</h3>
<p>Any students seeking access to the food pantry, Swipes program, CalFresh, and other efforts can sign up at the Slug Support office at Hahn Student Services.</p>
<p>Qualifying for Slug Support is simple, says Gonzalez. &#8220;During the intake process the Slug Support staff asks a few general questions to get a sense of whether this is a chronic or acute situation, and to document student need.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past year, 3,000&#8211;4,000 students used the Slug Support system for everything from the food pantry to gift cards at local grocery stores.</p>
<p>Student interns are helping spread the word about the various options available to help stretch students&#8217; food budget dollars. &#8220;We realized that to get more student engagement, we need students to interface with their peers,&#8221; Galarneau said</p>
<p>That includes FSWG interns working at the food pantry to get feedback from users and refine the offerings, teaching free workshops about budgeting and meal preparation, and running the Pop-Up program and outreach.</p>
<p>Second-year student, Diane Villalba works with a team of interns that is working with staff and faculty to advance efforts to improve services and support for their peers.&#160; &#8220;Its important that we can work together to make a difference and ensure students know the resources they have to succeed,&#8221; Villalba said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=761&amp;dids=189&amp;</url><title>To give to the Student Assistance Emergency Fund</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d920326b80727017030a023d4c27c040"><name>founders-2016-celebration-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Founders Celebration 2016: Worlds collide</title><summary>This year's celebration will be a time to pay tribute to intellectual adventure and generosity at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>That is exactly what will happen this Saturday when a group of revelers and honored guests converge at the Science &amp; Engineering Library in honor of <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/">Founders Celebration</a>, a time to recognize excellence, forward-thinking vision, intellectual adventure, and generosity at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Guests will get an exclusive sneak preview of photos from the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html">Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Collection</a>, a photographic archive recently given to UC Santa Cruz&#8212;the largest single gift in the campus&#8217;s history, with an estimated value of $32 million&#8212;that documents the people, landscape, and politics of California in the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>Among this year&#8217;s group of honored guests will be <strong>Julie Snyder</strong> (Kresge &#8217;95, politics), co-creator of the record-setting, ground-breaking, and insanely addictive podcast <em>Serial,</em> who will receive this year&#8217;s Alumni Achievement Award.<em>&#160;</em></p>
<p>Snyder is being recognized for outstanding personal achievement in radio broadcasting, storytelling, and podcasting, along with lasting contributions to her field<em>.</em></p>
<p>The library venue is appropriate, considering that the theme of this year&#8217;s Founders Celebration is &#8220;collision space,&#8221; the place where technology, information, and ideas come together to support dynamic exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Collision space&#8221; also refers to the fact that the library has been evolving into a place that combines &#8220;wired" accessibility, face-to-face meetings, quiet study, and classroom learning.</p>
<p>The &#8220;collision space&#8221; theme applies well to the work of Snyder, who, along with fellow former <em>This American Life</em> staffer Sarah Koenig, has created and overseen what may very well be the most listened-to and influential podcast of all time; Snyder and Koenig&#8217;s work is a thoughtful &#8220;collision&#8221; of old-fashioned storytelling and reporting with state-of-the-art podcasting technology, which allowed them to produce their program without having to convince radio stations to shoehorn it into their programming schedule.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s celebration will be a homecoming for Snyder, who first became immersed in the potentials of journalism, storytelling, and broadcasting while at UC Santa Cruz. Her time at the campus&#8217;s radio station, KZSC-FM, was an apprenticeship in its own right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were flirting with disaster, constantly,&#8221; Snyder recalled. &#8220;At the time, I think we did a 15-minute newscast every night before the hour-long (KPFA-FM) news feed, and it was awful. We basically stole the stories out of the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>, but the fact is, I never thought anyone was listening and it didn&#8217;t even really matter. Then I met someone who said she listened to it all the time because it was really funny. She waited to see when and how we were going to mess it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other honorees include UC Santa Cruz linguistics professor <strong>Sandra Chung,</strong> who will receive this year&#8217;s Faculty Research Award for her work focusing on 1,200 related languages spoken on Pacific island archipelagos&#8212;especially Chamorro, an understudied language of the Mariana Islands&#8212;and the <strong>Helen and Will Webster Foundation,</strong> which will be honored with the Fiat Lux Award. Claudia and Alec Webster (Rachel Carson College '02, environmental studies) help steward the foundation.</p>
<p>The Websters have been newsmakers on campus for their generosity and vision. Their philanthropy named and endowed the newly rededicated Rachel Carson College (formerly College Eight), and established five endowed chairs.</p>
<p>The Websters are also known for their intervention to save the picturesque but foundering Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, which was on the verge of collapse before they funded an ambitious rebuilding project. The barn is now a center for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s environmental and sustainability programs, home to the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and a campus and community hub.</p>
<p>Tickets <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/">are now available for the Founders Celebration</a>. Revelers have options. They may purchase individual tickets, buy a deluxe package, or purchase a table.</p>
<p>This event is part of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future.

<p>The theme for this year's open house is "Cross-Pollination, the Art and Science of Natural History."&#160; The Norris Center has teamed up with renowned local nature illustrator Maryjo Koch and will display her illustrations alongside many of the Norris Center&#8217;s extensive collections, including the Randall Morgan Pollinator Collection.</p>
<p>Also on display will be fresh fungus specimens, butterflies and moths from around the world, mammals, birds, and reptiles, and graduate student research involving the collection.</p>
<p>Koch will give painting demonstrations at 1 p.m. both days. A raffle of prizes, including local field guides and classes at Koch&#8217;s studio, will take place each day at 2 p.m.&#160; Other merchandise, including hats, note-cards, tote-bags, field guides, and Koch&#8217;s original artwork, will be for sale. All sales benefit the Norris Center.</p>
<p>The Norris Center was established in 2014 as part of an endowment gift from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.&#160; Its mission is to inspire and provide resources for anyone interested in studying the natural world.</p>
<p>Through its work, the center carries on the legacy of beloved environmental studies professor Ken Norris, who inspired many generations of UC Santa Cruz students to pursue their passions as naturalists. Currently, thanks to a generous donor, the center is expanding art-related opportunities for students and the broader community.</p>

 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;Dutch drug policy has opened to empirical examination what has until recently too often remained unquestioned drug war orthodoxy,&#8221; Reinarman writes in Criminology &amp; Public Policy. Reinarman, who has devoted most of his career to studying various aspects of drugs and drug policy, looks at how the Dutch have managed cannabis use with few problems and little policing.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Drug policies must be evaluated on the basis of their actual consequences,&#8221; he says.<br/>
<br/>
 To better understand cannabis legislation in the Dutch context, Reinarman contextualizes the history of the country&#8217;s drug policy with the country&#8217;s legal culture. Tolerance, reducing police power, and keeping lawbreakers out of prison when possible underscores their legal system. Informal social control is preferred.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 When two Dutch national commissions showed cannabis experimentation common and addiction rare, policymakers paid close attention, he said. Moreover, they understood that punishment would stigmatize and marginalize users.<br/>
<br/>
 The Dutch Prosecutors General decided it was not practical to enforce laws against the drug. In 1976, the Dutch Opium Act allowed cannabis sales in a regulated market that resulted in tighter social controls, Reinarman writes.<br/>
<br/>
 Meanwhile in the U.S., Reinarman points to evidence from the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse that found it is easier for many high school students to obtain illegal marijuana than it is to access legal but regulated substances like tobacco, alcohol, or prescription drugs.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;For a century, the United States has pursued drug policies designed to deter use by stigmatizing, punishing, and ostracizing users,&#8221; Reinarman writes.<br/>
<br/>
 Problematically, criminalization only amplifies inequality. Marginalized groups are pushed deeper into illicit spaces. A lower cost of entry and higher income than in the legal economy makes it appealing when life choices are constrained.<br/>
<br/>
 In the Netherlands, drug policy keeps users inside the legal system. Compared to the U.S., there is also a stronger welfare state, health care system, and social housing. There is also substantially less poverty and addiction and crime rates are lower. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;In thinking about U.S. drug policy, my Dutch colleagues often use a &#8220;stopped-up sink&#8221; metaphor: &#8220;Americans keep feverishly mopping up the floor, but the faucet is still running.&#8221;<br/>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Speaking at the Kuumbwa Jazz center Tuesday evening (Oct. 18) Wirls was one of three UC Santa Cruz professors who discussed the role rage and hostility plays in the political process. Sociologist Deborah Gould also spoke and literature professor Sean Keilen facilitated the discussion.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Wirls was responding Keilen&#8217;s question on how passion shapes collective life. Keilen had been talking about</span> <span>Coriolanus</span><span>, Shakespeare's Roman tragedy about an angered and misunderstood war hero who seeks political leadership in a volatile state.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Shakespeare to Hamilton</span></h3>
<span>Wirls pivoted from Shakespeare to Alexander Hamilton and James Madison&#8217;s</span> <span>Federalist Papers</span><span>, a collection of 85 articles and essays that describe how a government should channel the opposing opinions and emotions that inevitably arise in a free society.</span><br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Wirls, whose research focuses on American political history, emphasized the need for a tighter relationship between the public and their elected representatives. &#8220;There is a gap between the rhetorical power of a president who will speak for us and the power a president has to get things done,&#8221; Wirls said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He described the current political system being in a &#8220;hyper-partisan quagmire&#8221; and suggested abolishing the U.S. Senate rule requiring a supermajority vote to pass legislation to overcome the threat of filibuster. &#8220;It is a root of the failure of policy change,&#8221; he said.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;In this system, all you can can hope for is a unified government.&#8221;&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For Wirls, the political system needs to be reorganized so anger can be effectively channeled. People need to feel their vote produces something and their voice is worth something, he said.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Anger as critique</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We are in a moment of capitalism that is incompatible with democracy,&#8221; said Gould, who studies political emotion and affect.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She argued there is not a lot of faith in the political system. &#8220;The political system is not dealing with the economic precarity everyone is feeling,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The result? A legitimacy crisis that is leading to cynicism, resignation, and withdrawal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gould pointed to the commonalities between Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Sanders and Trump provided a vehicle to express outrage of money taking over politics,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Referencing the work of civil rights activist and feminist writer Audre Lorde, Gould said that anger can communicate injustice and inequality. It can reveal problems impacting society and make sense of power relationships.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Authority to criticize</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Anger gives authority to criticize but it can also reduce your ability to receive it, Keilen &#160;emphasized. &#8220;Shakespeare gives you access to many points of view,&#8221; he said, adding how theater allows the audience to feel a range of emotions&#8212;including being angry. Theater also provides the opportunity for the audience to experience the consequences of acting on those emotions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As Gould said: understanding what the possibility from political outcomes can be challenging. There are risks, and the current election is revealing that, she said. While anger can challenge the status quo, you do not know what could take its place, for example a military coup or fascism.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For Gould, there is more to simply showing up to the polls to vote.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We need to vote &#8230;</span> <em>and</em><span>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the next day that matters.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Gould is the author of <span><em>Moving Politics: Emotion</em> and <em>ACT UP's Fight Against AIDS</em></span> <span>(University of Chicago Press, 2009). She also wrote a chapter titled "Political Despair" in</span> <em>Politics and the Emotions: The Affective Turn in Contemporary Political Studies</em> <span>(Continuum, 2012).<br/>

<p>The Altiplano-Puna plateau is a high, dry region in the central Andes that includes parts of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, with vast plains punctuated by spectacular volcanoes. In a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13185">study published October 25 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers used remote sensing data and topographic modeling techniques to reveal an enormous dome in the plateau.</p>
<p>About 3,300 feet (1 kilometer) high and hundreds of miles across, the dome sits right above the largest active magma body on Earth. The uplifting of the dome is the result of the thickening of the crust due to the injection of magma from below, according to Noah Finnegan, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the paper.</p>
<p>"The dome is the Earth's response to having this huge low-density magma chamber pumped into the crust," Finnegan said. &#160;</p>
<p>The uplifting of the dome accounts for about one-fifth of the height of the central Andes, said first author Jonathan Perkins, who led the study as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is now at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
<p>"It's a large part of the evolution of the Andes that hadn't been quantified before," Perkins said.</p>
<p><strong>Plate tectonics</strong></p>
<p>The other forces uplifting the Andes are tectonic, resulting from the South American continental plate overriding the Nazca oceanic plate. The subduction zone where the Nazca plate dives beneath the western edge of South America is the source of the magma entering the crust and feeding volcanic activity in the region. Water released from the subducting slab of oceanic crust changes the melting temperature of the overlying wedge of mantle rock, causing it to melt and rise into the overriding plate.</p>
<p>Perkins and Finnegan worked with researchers at the University of Arizona who had used seismic imaging to reveal the remarkable size and extent of the Altiplano-Puna magma body in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2014.07.022">paper published in 2014</a>. That study detected a huge zone of melted material about 7 miles thick and 125 miles in diameter, much larger than previous estimates.</p>
<p>"People had known about the magma body, but it had not been quantified that well," Perkins said. "In the new study, we were able to show a tight spatial coupling between that magma body and this big, kilometer-high dome."</p>
<p>Based on their topographic analysis and modeling studies, the researchers calculated the amount of melted material in the magma body, yielding an estimate close to the previous calculation based seismic imaging. "This provides a direct and independent verification of the size and extent of the magma body," Finnegan said. "It shows that you can use topography to learn about deep crustal processes that are hard to quantify, such as the rate of melt production and how much magma was pumped into the crust from below."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Super-volcanoes</strong></p>
<p>The Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex was one of the most volcanically active places on Earth starting about 10 million years ago, with several super-volcanoes producing massive eruptions and creating a large complex of collapsed calderas in the region. Although no major eruptions have occurred in several thousand years, there are still active volcanoes and geothermal activity in the region. In addition, satellite surveys of surface deformation since the 1990s have shown that uplifting of the surface is continuing to occur at a relatively rapid rate in a few places. At Uturuncu volcano located right in the center of the dome, the uplift is about 1 centimeter (less than half an inch) per year.</p>
<p>"We think the ongoing uplift is from the magma body," Perkins said. "The jury is still out on exactly what's causing it, but we don't think it's related to a supervolcano."</p>
<p>The growth of the crust beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, driven by the intrusion of magma from below, is a fundamental process in the building of continents. "This is giving us a glimpse into the factory where continents get made," Perkins said. "These big magmatic systems form during periods called magmatic flare-ups when lots of melt gets injected into Earth's crust. It's analogous to the process that created the Sierra Nevada 90 million years ago, but we're seeing it now in real time."</p>
<p>In addition to Perkins and Finnegan, the coauthors of the paper include Kevin Ward, George Zandt, and Susan Beck at the University of Arizona and Shanaka de Silva at Oregon State University. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e39869fa80727017030a023d70283d05"><name>achieve-uc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor to urge high school students to pursue higher education dreams</title><summary>In support of Achieve UC, Chancellor George Blumenthal will speak to 400 Watsonville High School students to encourage them to pursue a higher education.</summary><keywords>access, affordability, uc, education, </keywords><start-date>1476975600000</start-date><display-name>UC Achieve</display-name><path>/2016/10/achieve-uc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/achieve-uc</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1476992197741</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477606529330</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/grb-students.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/grb-students.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grb-students.jpg</name><display-name>grb-students.jpg</display-name><file-size>144554</file-size><width>400</width><height>278</height></image><image-alt>Chancellor with students</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/grb-students-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/grb-students-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grb-students-80px.jpg</name><display-name>grb-students-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17505</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Achieve UC is meant to&#160;provide young people with both inspiration and practical tools to get on a path to college&#8212;whether at UC or elsewhere.

<p>&#8220;Every student in Santa Cruz County and beyond should know a UC education is within their reach,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;The University California is committed to making an education affordable and attainable for all students in our state.&#8221;</p>
<p>In support of <a href="http://achieve.universityofcalifornia.edu">Achieve UC</a>, Blumenthal will speak to 400 Watsonville High School students from 9:30&#8211;11 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 26. The day is filled with additional sessions that focus on pathways to UC, CSU, and community colleges, as well as financial aid options.</p>
<p>Senior leaders from all 10 UC campuses will visit high schools around the state, delivering the message that college-and a UC education-is attainable and affordable to students from all walks of life. The university has one of the most generous financial aid programs in the nation: 57 percent of California students receive enough aid to completely cover their tuition and fees, and 75 percent pay less than the sticker price.</p>
<p>Events are targeted, in part, toward schools and communities with significant numbers of students who are UC eligible but have relatively low application numbers. The goal is to provide young people with both inspiration and practical tools to get on a path to college-whether at UC or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Blumenthal will speak to students from WHS in grades 10&#8211;12 about the feasibility of a UC education and the importance of acquiring a college degree. The event will also include workshops for seniors that are designed to highlight the various college systems and two resource/college fairs for students to get their questions answered, and create opportunities that expand access to, and interest in, post-secondary education.</p>
<p>UC leaders will reach roughly 30,000 students from schools with lower than average college-going rates from October through May 2017. College representatives will also be on hand to talk to students about applying to college, the availability of scholarships, and financial aid.</p>
<p>Students often are unaware of the range of resources available to make college affordable for all Californians. UC&#8217;s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, for instance, covers the full cost of tuition for students whose families earn $80,000 a year or less.</p>
<p>More than half of UC undergraduates who are California residents pay zero tuition thanks to the Blue and Gold Plan and other grants and scholarships.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want every hardworking student to know that there is a place for you at UC,&#8221; UC President Janet Napolitano said. &#8220;Our doors are open-and we are committed to opening them even wider, with a plan to welcome thousands more California students to our campuses over the next two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students are often surprised to learn how many from their school who apply to UC get in. Those who aren&#8217;t ready for a four-year college will learn about new transfer pathways that have simplified the process of getting to UC from community college-a route taken by one out of every three UC graduates.</p>
<p>&#8220;A UC education is a game-changer that will continue to open doors for the rest of your life,&#8221; Napolitano said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do your part: work hard, take advantage of leadership opportunities, and push yourself to take challenging classes. And no matter who you are, where you come from or how much money you and your family have, we&#8217;ll do our part to help you get here.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e39d846580727017030a023daea74760"><name>controlled-burns</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wilder Ranch controlled burns planned</title><summary>Wilder Ranch State Park is conducting a series of vegetation management burns beginning today and going through the rest of the week.&#13;

<br/>
Burn operations may occur on various days depending on weather conditions, resource availability, and fire activity in the region.<br/>
<br/>
Smoke will be visible but is not cause for alarm. As with any controlled burn in the vicinity of UCSC, however, there is a possibility of smoke affecting the campus. Those who may encounter health problems related to smoke exposure should take appropriate precautions.<br/>
<br/>
Controlled burns are one of the tools used to assist with habitat maintenance and reduction of fire hazard. Burning under prescribed conditions is beneficial for coastal grassland habitats to reduce non-native species and increase the abundance and diversity of California grasses and wildflowers.<br/>

<div></div></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Program will help recruit and retain students, promote community food security</article-subhead><article-text><p>A $275,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will help Colleges Nine and Ten at UC Santa Cruz expand projects in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties to promote food security and food justice among predominantly Spanish-speaking, farmworker families.</p>
<p>The program, funded through a Hispanic Serving Institutions initiative of the USDA&#8217;s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, will help recruit, retain, and engage underrepresented undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz as well as benefit elementary and high school students in the communities of Watsonville and Gonzales.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversifying Food Studies and Fostering Community Food Security&#8221; builds on work Colleges Nine and Ten students have under way with community gardens at Calabasas School in Watsonville, said project director Flora Lu, associate professor of environment studies and provost for the two colleges. Stacy Philpott, associate professor of environmental studies and Ruth and Alfred Heller Chair in Agroecology, is co-project director.</p>
<p>&#8220;The colleges are microcosms of innovation,&#8221; Lu said, explaining how the community garden program at Calabasas School began three years ago as a program aligned with College Ten&#8217;s theme of social justice and community.&#160; Students volunteered at the school last spring for an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/alternative-spring-break.html">alternative spring break</a>.</p>
<p>Lu said the key component of the project is to help retain UC Santa Cruz students from underrepresented groups who are often the first in their families to attend university.</p>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz has made significant progress in increasing enrollments of underrepresented students in agricultural science programs, little work has been done to understand the viewpoints, expectations, and experiences of these undergraduates once they arrive at college, she said.</p>
<p>Working with school children and families in communities similar to where they grew up both provides real world experiences and positions them as mentors for younger students, she said.</p>
<p>Lu estimates that 150 elementary school children will benefit from the after-school, garden-based program and community garden supported by UC Santa Cruz interns. Additionally, the program will help approximately 70 high school students build skills around food justice, and more than 400 undergraduate college students will benefit from new curricula, and volunteer, service learning, and research opportunities. Also, it is expected that as many as five graduate students will assist with project research, and program development and dissemination.</p>
<p>Program manager is a UC Santa Cruz alumna, Emily Beggs (Cowell &#8217;08, Latin American and Latino studies and politics).&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m excited because in my work and my life, I see food as the tool to create connection and inclusion and bring people together. We can use food to get students more connected,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Between UC Santa Cruz and graduate studies at Stanford, Beggs worked in an urban garden in Oakland.&#160; She said UCSC is at the forefront of developing a model of food and agriculture-based education. &#8220;You don&#8217;t see food and justice programs happening at other universities. This is an exciting opportunity to build programs that other universities can follow,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel, a longtime supporter of agriculture initiatives on the Central Coast, praised the program. &#8220;Fostering food security to ensure families have access to healthy meals allows people and families to focus on getting a better education, a better job, more training and other activities to uplift themselves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has long served our community through a variety of outstanding education and outreach programs and I look forward to working with them more during my last few months in Congress,&#8221; Farr said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/alternative-spring-break.html</url><title>Colleges Nine and Ten students enjoy an alternative spring break in Watsonville </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e41e625c80727017030a023dcf6d749f"><name>research-frontiers-evening-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Annual social sciences research event explores politics of change</title><summary>How and why politics and policy are failing minority groups was a central theme at the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences’ fourth annual research event, "Politics of Change?!

The Social Sciences Take on 2016."</p>
<p>Campus and community members gathered at the Santa Cruz County Veterans Memorial Building Wednesday (Oct. 19) as the speakers discussed how their research applies to politics and change.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway and Dean of the Social Sciences Division Sheldon Kamieniecki kicked off the evening and Carla Hesse, dean of the College of Letters and Science at UC Berkeley, delivered the keynote, "</span><span>Is There a Revolution in the Social Sciences?</span><span>"</span></p>
<p><span>"Most of the problems we face exceed the nation-state framework,&#8221; said Hesse. Major problems such as climate change, migration, economic security are beyond the reach of government structure and sovereignty. These issues do not have any borders, she added. Similarly, the social sciences are seeing traditional disciplinary borders bleed into other disciplines.</span> <span>As a result, an epistemological shift is happening. Social scientists need new questions and tools to address these new problems, she said.</span></p>
<h3>The 14.8 percent</h3>
One of the new challenges social scientists are addressing is rising poverty in America. Heather Bullock, professor of psychology and director of the UC Santa Cruz Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise and Participatory Governance, shared what beliefs about poverty and wealth influence specific political outcomes. 
<p dir="ltr"><span>According to latest census data, 43.1 million people or 13.5 percent of the U.S. population live in poverty; shared prosperity ended in the 1970s. What do Americans think about the nation&#8217;s wealthy and poor, and how do attitudes influence decisions in economic policy?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For example, believing individual characteristics account for a person&#8217;s poverty (e.g. seeing the poor as lazy, unmotivated, disinterested in education and unable to spend and save money) will lead to restrictive welfare and housing policies and tax policy that benefit the wealthy, Bullock said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In contrast, believing that poverty can be attributed to structural issues (e.g. underfunded schools, low-paying jobs, and discrimination against people of color and low-income groups) results in progressive welfare policies, supportive housing policies, and a rejection of tax policies that benefit the wealthy.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Another 1 percent</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Then there are Indians in the U.S., who make up 1 percent of the population, and according to new research from Nirvikar Singh, d<span>istinguished professor of economics</span> also have some of the highest levels of educational attainment and income of all foreign- and native-born groups in the country.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Highlighting findings from his forthcoming book,</span> <em>The Other One Percent: Indians in America</em> <span>(Oxford University Press, 2016), Singh asked how did a population from a poor developing nation with low human capital achieve this rank in the world&#8217;s most advanced nation?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Singh argued that Indian Americans are the outliers, with a distinct immigration status that is employment based rather than family based. For example, Indian Americans maintain a strong and increasing concentration in the technology sector and are entrepreneurial. Recent studies have found that 6-8 percent of high-tech start-ups had Indian-origin founders, he shared.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>The 8 percent</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sociologist Veronica Terriquez asked why have young adults become politically disengaged. Her current research explores how grassroots youth organizing efforts in California catalyzed civic and political engagement with young people.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In 2014, only 8 percent of California voters ages 18-24 turned out to vote. For the 65-74 demographic, the number was 57 percent.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Your grandparent is seven times more likely to vote,&#8221; she said. Millennials feel powerless, uniformed, overwhelmed, and frustrated, she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But when young people belong to a civic organization they remain politically active into adulthood.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Young people have to rely on each other to get out and vote,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Also speaking at the event was environmental studies professor Andrew Szasz, who shared findings from his book</span> <span>S<em>hopping our Way to Safety: How We Changed from Protecting the Environment to Protecting Ourselves</em></span> <span>(University of Minnesota Press, 2009). When consumers believe that they are indeed buying a defense from environmental hazards, they feel less urgency to actually do something to fix them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Legal studies professor Elizabeth Beaumont discussed the challenges of dissent, and Politics Department Chair Dean Mathiowetz talked about how meditation can foster democratic political engagement.&#160;<br/>

<p>As scientists deploy their instruments at research sites throughout the <a href="http://www.ucnrs.org/">UC Natural Reserve System</a>, networked cameras will monitor changes in the vegetation, snapping photos every half hour, while lasers track carbon flow in coastal redwood forests and environmental sensors monitor the microclimates experienced by plants and animals in different habitats. Researchers are also working to reconstruct historical climate variation and changes in land use patterns, assessing the effects of reduced rainfall, and studying the linkages between land and sea along the California coast.</p>
<p>All of these projects are coordinated by the UC-wide <a href="http://iseeci.ucnrs.org/">Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts</a> (ISEECI). "Having a whole network of UC scientists working together allows us to accomplish a lot more than we could individually. And as a resource for climate change studies, the Natural Reserve System is a jewel," said ISEECI director Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The overall goal is to provide an integrated understanding of how ecosystems respond to climate change across broad geographic scales, allowing scientists to identify California's greatest vulnerabilities and find opportunities to lessen the impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Global issue</strong></p>
<p>"Climate change is the big global issue of our time. I don't see the impacts on nature as separate from the human impacts, because we depend on natural ecosystems in so many ways," said ISEECI codirector Laurel Fox, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. "Taking a statewide approach to studying climate change will give us the information we need to start thinking about how to deal with climate change and how to identify solutions and adaptations."</p>
<p>ISEECI was established in 2014 with the support of a $1.9 million grant from the UC President's Research Catalyst Awards program. By bringing together scientists from different campuses, ISEECI has catalyzed new collaborations that have won additional funding from agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF). A major new NSF grant, for example is funding research on the interactions between fog, climate change, and redwood forests. Led by Elliott Campbell at UC Merced, the multi-campus, $1.75 million project will provide crucial data supporting the broader goals of ISEECI, Sinervo said.</p>
<p>"These ideas grew out of our first meeting, and Elliott's project is a major cornerstone in our plans for ISEECI," he said.</p>
<p>Fog is an important source of summer moisture for coastal redwood forests, but it also interferes with standard methods for studying carbon flow in forests. Campbell's team will use a novel technique involving high-tech laser spectrometers to gather crucial data on redwood tree physiology. Research by Sinervo and others on the animals that live in redwood forests will build on the findings from Campbell's project.</p>
<p>"We have just begun instrumenting the Big Creek Reserve with ecophysiological sensors and a long-term monitoring program to piggy-back off of the inferences that Elliott and his collaboration find regarding redwoods under climate change," Sinervo said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Sensor network</strong></p>
<p>The sensor network being deployed at Big Creek and 11 other reserves is funded by another NSF grant, led by Sinervo and Fox at UCSC and Susan Mazer at UC Santa Barbara. Their collaboration extends beyond the UC reserves to include scientists at the University of Northern Arizona's <a href="http://www.sega.nau.edu/">Southwest Experimental Garden Array</a> (SEGA).</p>
<p>"SEGA is addressing a similar set of questions, and this collaboration enables us to compare regions across California and into Arizona for patterns related to climate change," said Fox, who is currently leading a major grant proposal for an even larger project that would also involve SEGA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an ongoing project under the ISEECI umbrella is looking at the effects of reduced precipitation in different ecosystems using a standardized protocol for excluding rain and snow from study sites. Led by Michael Loik, professor of environmental studies at UCSC, the NRS study sites are part of a larger international network of sites, called <a href="http://wp.natsci.colostate.edu/droughtnet/">Drought-Net</a>, designed to assess the sensitivity of global ecosystems to drought.</p>
<p>ISEECI now involves about 130 affiliated faculty across all 9 UC undergraduate campuses, and is funding five postdoctoral fellows and about 30 graduate students throughout the UC system. The effort includes a broad range of projects addressing different aspects of the climate change problem.</p>
<p>"We have big plans that go well beyond the scope of what we're currently funded for, so we're always looking for new sources of funding," Fox said. "My hope is to have additional funding in place to continue this work beyond the four years of the initial grant."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://vimeo.com/131398010</url><title>Video: Studying Climate Change in the UC Natural Reserve System</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/environment-and-nature/20160930/protecting-the-big-sur-redwoods-how-is-climate-change-a-threat</url><title>Santa Cruz Sentinel: Protecting the Big Sur redwoods: How is climate change a threat</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e9338f7b80727017030a023d569c474c"><name>voter-registration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Voter registration and Election Day reminder</title><summary>Monday, Oct. 24 is the deadline to register to vote in the Nov. 8 General Election.

<p>Using the latest modeling techniques, scientists from the conservation, engineering, and insurance sectors studied the impact of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast United States in 2012, when New York and New Jersey were badly hit by storm surges. The study found more than $625 million in property damages were prevented during this natural catastrophe by coastal wetlands along the Northeast coast.</p>
<p>Without wetlands, the damage bill would be much higher for Sandy and other predicted hurricanes. Where wetlands remain, the average damage reduction from Sandy was greater than 10 percent. Experts within the study team expect that the analyses of the effects of Hurricane Matthew earlier this month will demonstrate similar protections.</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco Bay</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to put a dollar value on the coastal protection benefits from wetlands, using Hurricane Sandy as a test case. The results are relevant for many other areas such as San Francisco Bay, where we have lost 85 percent of historic wetlands and face grave risks from future flooding,&#8221; said project lead Michael Beck, an adjunct professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy. &#8220;Our work shows how we can align risk reduction and conservation interests to identify where to do marsh restoration and how to fund it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Maryland, wetlands reduced property damages from Sandy by nearly 30 percent, and in New Jersey, wetlands prevented $425 million in property damages. In Ocean County, NJ, the conservation of salt marshes is predicted to reduce average annual coastal property losses by more than 20 percent. (Additional findings available <a href="http://www.lloyds.com/lloyds/corporate-responsibility/charity/tercentenary-research-foundation/the-role-of-coastal-habitats-in-managing-natural-hazards-and-risk-reduction">online here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Critical protection</strong></p>
<p>Wetlands are critical not just for catastrophic hurricanes, but also for all the likely storms in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unexpected to find just how effective wetlands can be at reducing property damages from catastrophic storms and hurricanes. It was also critical that we were able to combine state-of-art engineering models with coastal ecology and economic analysis,&#8221; said Siddharth Narayan, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the study. &#8220;Our coastal habitats are natural defenses, and in this study, we show that their risk reduction services add up to hundreds of millions of dollars along the U.S. East Coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our models traditionally focus on man-made coastal defense structures, or on other grey architecture solutions, like elevating properties above sea level,&#8221; said Paul Wilson, VP of model development at RMS and expert in hurricane and storm surge. &#8220;This study is pioneering because it applies cutting-edge modeling science to natural defenses, and it allows us to put a financial value on the role wetlands play in protecting our coastal communities against storm surges.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Economic value</strong></p>
<p>By quantifying the economic value of natural defenses, they can be more effectively included in risk models and coastal management. In fact, the protection they provide is often incorporated in industry risk models, but these benefits are often pooled with many other factors and then not clearly recognized by risk modelers, (re)insurers, brokers, clients, and others. Wetlands can be straightforwardly included in results provided by the risk and engineering sectors and thus more easily considered in coastal development and habitat restoration decisions.</p>
<p>There were also additional critical findings for coastal policy makers. For example, some townships with few wetlands within their borders benefit greatly from wetland preservation in neighboring townships; the value of wetlands to properties accumulates as you move upstream away from the coast.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the benefits was surprising given how many coastal wetlands already have been lost throughout the region. For example, wetlands did not reduce as much damage in New York in part because of their extensive loss in past decades. At the same time, even relatively small, thin bands of wetlands serve as an effective first line of defense, and they can be restored to build <a href="http://coastalresilience.org/project-areas/new-jersey-introduction/">coastal resilience</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Incentives to conserve and restore</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This work shows the unlikely yet powerful benefits of collaboration between insurers, engineers, and conservationists in identifying solutions to reduce risks to people, property, and nature,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;The work highlights where we can find innovative financing opportunities and incentives for conserving and restoring coastal wetlands, which plainly put is good for the environment and good for business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lloyd&#8217;s Tercentenary Research Foundation aims to fund cutting-edge scientific research that contributes positively to society; this principle is embodied in the ongoing project led by the University of California at Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Jean-Bernard Crozet, trustee of Lloyd&#8217;s Tercentenary Research Foundation and head of underwriting modelling at MS Amlin. &#8220;Coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and salt marshes play a fundamental role in reducing the risk of storm surge. The LTRF believes that improved quantification of these benefits will, in turn, lead to better management and conservation of these natural ecosystems, contributing not only to risk reduction along our coasts but to our planet&#8217;s sustainability in the long run.&#8221;</p>

<p>Graduate student crystal am nelson was one of the first people to get a close look at the stunning work of renowned photographers Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch that is part of Special Collections in McHenry Library.</p>
<p>The black-and-white prints include powerful images of the 1960s, including portraits of Black Panthers, rallies, protests, and street scenes.</p>
<p>"The collection was sitting in Special Collections. No one had gone through it," recalled nelson, a doctoral student in the History of Art and Visual Culture program. "It was exciting."</p>
<p>In 2014, nelson got her white-gloved hands on the images as a participant in the library's Center for Archival Research and Training (CART), a program that supports graduate students who want to learn about archival research; students work closely with a professional archivist for one quarter to process and describe a collection related to their research interests. An aspiring exhibition curator, the program was a perfect fit for nelson, a photographer with a master's in fine art from the San Francisco Art Institute who is interested in contemporary representations of African American women.</p>
<p>"At the art institute, we talked about Pirkle Jones all the time," said nelson. Discovering Baruch's work was eye-opening. The two photographers, who met at the art institute and later married, were contemporaries of such luminaries as Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Dorothea Lange. "Photography as fine art started in this region&#8212;San Francisco to Monterey&#8212;and there's a lot of the history of photography represented in this collection."</p>
<p>The CART fellowship paid double dividends: nelson learned about archival work, and the project aligned nicely with her research interests.</p>
<p>"I got to learn all that goes into processing a collection, from caring for it to the power of the archivist to shape the experiences of researchers and visitors," said nelson. "I saw the range of their interests from the 1930s, when he first started, through the 1970s and '80s. I got to look at his finished photos and also see his process."</p>
<p>Jones favored abstraction, buildings, and nature, while Baruch consistently photographed women and children.</p>
<p>As part of the fellowship, nelson selected images for inclusion in a 2015 "Activism in the Archives" exhibit at McHenry and <a href="http://exhibits.library.ucsc.edu/exhibits/show/activism-in-the-archives">online</a>. She focused on a collaboration between the photographers and the Black Panthers in 1968, selecting several of Baruch's images of women and children.</p>
<p>"The dominant narrative about the Black Panther Party focuses on the men&#8212;images of young men in leather jackets, black berets, guns," said nelson. "Ruth-Marion took a lot of photos of women who weren't in the party attending rallies and events. It's amazing to see this coterie of women who were part of the larger community. It's classical portraiture, not ethnographic. They are stunning.</p>
<p>"There's the dominant narrative, but all these other things that were happening are important to the story," said nelson. "As a CART fellow, doing background research, I learned the bigger story."</p>
<p>The exhibit also played a part in opening the door for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html">the highest-value gift in campus history</a>: The Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Photography Collection.</p>
<p>Jones had a deep affection for UC Santa Cruz; he and Adams spent many hours together photographing the campus in the late 1960s. In 2010, Jones donated the hand-curated collection of more than 2,600 photographs that nelson processed. That gift included his personal papers, as well as photographs by Baruch and about 150 Ansel Adams prints. Thanks to nelson, that collection is now available and accessible to scholars and the public.</p>
<p>But that was only a portion of the photographers' vast archives. A generation of UC Santa Cruz librarians, archivists and campus leaders had kept in touch with Jones and, after his death in 2009, representatives of his estate. The Marin Community Foundation held the archives and last fall began seeking a new home for the collection.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections &amp; Archives, invited Jennifer McFarland, executor of the Jones estate, to attend the Spring 2015 opening of the library's activism exhibit. When she saw it, McFarland encouraged the campus to compete for the entirety of the collection. Other universities and institutions were interested, but UC Santa Cruz prevailed.</p>
<p>Receiving the gift was like "coming full circle" because of Jones' long history with the campus, said Remak-Honnef. Processing of the new materials&#8212;a major undertaking&#8212;will begin promptly thanks to a generous donation from Mark Headley, Remak-Honnef said.</p>
<p>"It's a tremendous resource for anyone interested in Bay Area or California history, social justice, ecology and environmental issues," she said. Already, the campus has loaned prints to the Oakland Museum of California for their exhibit on the 50th anniversary of the Black Panthers.</p>
<p>nelson has continued working with the Jones-Baruch images, co-curating another exhibit this fall to commemorate the Black Panthers. She, too, raves about the contents, mentioning "Death of a Valley," a 1956 collaboration between Jones and Dorothea Lange that documented the loss of the Napa Valley community of Berryessa Valley to make way for a dam. The photos tell a story of displacement, environmental destruction, agricultural expansion, water rights, and more&#8212;themes that would likely resonate with UC Santa Cruz students, she noted.</p>
<p>"How do we get more students to use Special Collections?" she asked. "We have those photos. It's a gold mine."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8b1e3dd80727017030a023d8bc03b1a"><name>jones-baruch-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Photographic treasures find permanent home at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>An extraordinary collection of photographs documenting California in the mid-20th century has found a permanent home at UC Santa Cruz, establishing the campus as a tremendous resource for scholars of history, photography, and social documentation.</summary><start-date>1475478000000</start-date><display-name>Photographic treasures find permanent home at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2016/10/jones-baruch-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/jones-baruch-message</link><created-by>pguther</created-by><created-on>1477346188872</created-on><last-modified-by>pguther</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477589674990</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An extraordinary collection of photographs documenting California in the mid-20th century has <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html?ref=grb-message">found a permanent home at UC Santa Cruz</a>, establishing the campus as a tremendous resource for scholars of history, photography, and social documentation.</p>
<p>In the largest single gift in campus history, valued at $32 million, the Marin Community Foundation has donated The Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Collection to UC Santa Cruz. The collection consists of thousands of images by Jones and Baruch, as well as their contemporaries and collaborators Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, and Minor White.</p>
<p>Jones and Baruch are well-known for their documentary-style work and portraiture, particularly a series of images of Haight Ashbury in 1967, the Black Panthers in 1968, and the Napa Valley community of Berryessa Valley in 1956, when dam construction displaced residents of the town.</p>
<p>Jones, who passed away in 2009, forged a deep connection with this campus when he and Ansel Adams taught a photography workshop here in 1969. This gift builds on his donation in 2003 of a smaller collection of photographs and his personal papers.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Jones during a campus visit some years back. A spirited man, he appreciated the energy of this campus, its natural beauty, and its roots during a time of transformational social change.

Diversity poses an invaluable opportunity for each of us to learn about one another, to stretch our horizons, and to appreciate differences across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, ability, citizenship, political preference, and more.</p>
<p>Even with the best of intentions, however, this isn't easy to do. As we interact in residence halls, classrooms, offices, labs, on teams, and in clubs, we encounter&#8212;directly and sometimes indirectly&#8212;challenges. We are tested by language and actions that range from the unintentionally hurtful to&#8212;at times&#8212;the most egregious, deliberate hate speech and behavior.</p>
<p>Last week's campuswide police announcement that a man left packages of materials related to the "white power movement" on campus is a reminder that we aren't a "city on a hill," beyond the reach of those who seek to foment tension. Indeed, many of us are aggrieved by ongoing acts of violence against people of color and troubled by the political rhetoric of the presidential campaign. These are trying times.</p>
<p>This campus protects both free speech and academic freedom, and yet we know the degrading effects of hate speech and hateful acts. That's why it behooves each of us to play a role in speaking up, ensuring that voices of tolerance, compassion, and civility prevail.</p>
<p>As a microcosm of society, this campus is making important changes to meet the needs of our community. This fall, we introduced a new <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/trans-identified-housing.html">trans-friendly housing</a> option. Our Title IX Office has hired two more investigators, prompted by the growing number of complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault&#8212;a result, we believe, of greater awareness. African American students spoke up about their needs, and we responded by hiring an African American retention specialist, and Admissions is hiring a staff member with a primary focus on recruiting African American students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also actively working to give members of our community the skills they need to foster positive interactions. I want students, faculty, and staff to feel prepared for the difficult conversations that are sometimes necessary, and I want the conversations to have positive outcomes.</p>
<p>One example: For eight years, Donnae Smith, the coordinator of diversity and inclusion programs for Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/cultural-competency-students.html">has trained hundreds of student residential staff at the colleges</a> each fall to prepare them to address the tensions that can emerge when students from diverse backgrounds live together. The "big four" topics of negative encounters are gender identity and expression, race, religion, and sexual identity.</p>
<p>Participants feel empowered by the training, telling Donnae she "gives them language" to deal with upsetting or unkind encounters.</p>
<p>Many campus programs and professionals are dedicated to the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a> and to helping all students, faculty, and staff live up to our shared goals of embracing diversity, being just, open, purposeful, disciplined, caring, and celebrative.</p>
<p>Campus resource centers are focused on these issues, providing support and community to students, faculty, and staff. They include the <a href="http://aarcc.ucsc.edu/">African American Resource and Cultural Center</a>; <a href="http://airc.ucsc.edu/">American Indian Resource Center</a>; <a href="http://aapirc.ucsc.edu/">Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center</a>; <a href="http://elcentro.ucsc.edu/">Chicano Latino Resource Center--El Centro</a>; <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>; <a href="http://queer.ucsc.edu/">Cantu Queer Center</a>; and the <a href="http://womenscenter.ucsc.edu/">Women's Center</a>.</p>
<p>For faculty and staff, the <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/training/certificate_program/index.html">Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</a> combines professional development and cultural competency training; we added a <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/training/certificate_program/graduate-students.html">program for graduate students</a> last year. Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Herbie Lee serves as campus diversity officer for faculty, and we are hiring a new campus diversity officer for staff and students; <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/diversity-officer-candidates.html?utm_source=09-27-2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday">campus visits</a> are taking place this week and next.</p>
<p>This campus is committed to building a community free of bias, hate, and intimidation, but we aren't there yet; <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu/">resources for reporting incidents of hate or bias are available online</a>.</p>
<p>Disturbing news can have personal effects. If recent events, on campus or off, leave you feeling unsafe or particularly anxious, angry, or vulnerable, please reach out for support. <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> is available for students, and the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a> is available for faculty and staff.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to create a tolerant, just, and understanding community by pledging to monitor our own language and actions, to report incidents of hate or bias, and to speak up and support any individual or group that may be targeted. Ultimately, our strength lies in caring for one another.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>The Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8d52b1d80727017030a023d25c1785e"><name>byrd-microaggressions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Initial findings to be released in study of microaggressions on campus</title><summary>For the past year, UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Christy Byrd implemented a mobile app to track student experiences of microaggressions—the subtle ways assumptions and attitudes based on race, sexual orientation, or gender are communicated in everyday conversation.</summary><start-date>1477350000000</start-date><display-name>Microagrgession study</display-name><path>/2016/10/byrd-microaggressions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/byrd-microaggressions</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1477348500901</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477515740061</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/byrd-christy-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/byrd-christy-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>byrd-christy-425.jpg</name><display-name>byrd-christy-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>199163</file-size><width>425</width><height>553</height></image><image-alt>christy byrd portrait</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/christy-byrd-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/christy-byrd-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>christy-byrd-80.jpg</name><display-name>christy-byrd-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14489</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>christy byrd portrait</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Christy Byrd, assistant professor of psychology, will discuss findings of her study of microaggressions on campus.

<p>Byrd will discuss her initial findings at Colleges Nine and Ten&#8217;s quarterly faculty speaker series Wednesday, Oct. 26 at 5:30 p.m in the Namaste Lounge.</p>
<p>&#8220;A microaggression is any slight you perceive is based on a social identity you have,&#8221; she said. They can happen across identities. They also happen anywhere: with friends, at the coffee shop, in the gym, even in the classroom and on campus.</p>
<p>As part of her study, Byrd launched the mobile app <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/&#126;cmbyrd/microaggressionstudy.html">MicroReport</a> that allowed UC Santa Cruz students to report microaggressions they experienced or saw in the community. App users could also view reports of others. Six hundred incidents of microaggressions and other forms of discrimination and stereotyping were reported by more than 300 students.</p>
<p>One Latin American student reported a friend asking if they could wrap a burrito for them because they were Mexican. Another student shared how a classmate said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect you to be gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Often microaggressions are unintentional, but come with hurtful consequences.</p>
<p>Byrd shares that students who reported microaggressions are more likely to express depressive symptoms and higher stress.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that perceptions of more racial microaggressions were associated with lower self-esteem, lower feelings of competence for daily life, more depressive symptoms and more stress,&#8221; she said. This was based on 211 participants in the sample, controlling for gender, race, and social class. These emotional reactions were based on their responses to a follow-up survey.</p>
<p>The app is closed while Byrd and her lab analyze and organize the data. But the conversation about how to handle microaggressions is ongoing. In addition to Byrd&#8217;s Oct. 26 talk, she will also deliver a workshop Jan. 19, 2017 at Cowell/Stevenson. More information will be available closer to the date.</p>

<p>A subsequent investigation revealed that a bicycle outside of Harvey House had been stolen. The bicycle was later recovered outside of Maxwell House. With a great description of the subject, our officers conducted an extensive search and located Adam Brightwell, 38, of Santa Cruz, the subject described by the community member, holding bolt cutters at the bicycle racks at Porter College.</p>
<p>Brightwell admitted to stealing the bicycle and was arrested for petty theft, possession of burglary tools, possession of drug paraphernalia, and nonaffiliate possessing a knife on campus.</p>
<p>This arrest, coupled with other arrests over the past few weeks, exemplify how working together we can prevent crime in our community.</p>
<p>The community is encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity or persons by dialing 911 or <a href="tel:831-459-2231">831-459-2231</a>, ext. 1.</p>
<p>Report all in-progress crimes by calling 911 from any landline or cell phone. Reports may also be made by using one of the many "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Tips</strong><br/>
 Victims are not responsible for being victimized, regardless of any action or inaction on their part. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Report all suspicious persons, in-progress crimes, and emergencies to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911.</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, please remember to lock your vehicle and residence doors. Keep valuables secured and out of sight.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.</li>
<li>Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
 I hope this message finds you well as we approach fall mid-terms. One of my roles as associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing and Educational Services is to provide you with information that helps you to make safe choices. You should find the information below useful as you plan how and where to spend your time on Halloween this year.<br/>
<br/>
 On behalf of the university and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to avoid downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night and instead choose to be on campus in order to participate in one or more of the many programs offered throughout our college and residential communities. Please see <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2016/2016-10-14.html">here</a> for a list of programs hosted on campus. In past years on Halloween, the downtown has been marred by incidents of violence, including stabbings. Out of concern for community members who may unintentionally become victims of violence, the City of Santa Cruz takes a no tolerance stance toward those that would disrupt the community&#8217;s safety.<br/>
<br/>
 Like the City of Santa Cruz, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department also enforces a no tolerance policy in regard to unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior, and will deploy appropriate staff to deal with any issues that arise. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and allied law enforcement agencies will forward information to Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards those students engaged in unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior. Additional community safety officers (CSOs) will also be deployed throughout the campus&#8217;s residential areas. Please be mindful and respectful of all campus policies, rules, and regulations.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>CALL 911:</strong> Do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity or behavior by dialing 911 (on campus you may also dial <a href="tel:831/459-2231">831/459-2231,</a> ext 1). In addition, if you feel that someone is suffering from substance poisoning or other medical emergency, dial 911 immediately. Timely calls to 911 save lives.<br/>
<br/>
 If, however, you do choose to go downtown, please be advised:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Friday and Saturday nights preceding Halloween, UCSC will operate Night Owl buses on their regular schedule from downtown Santa Cruz (Cathcart Street) approximately every 20 minutes from 11:30pm until 2:10am. CSOs will be riding these buses to assist in identifying any individuals that are clearly intoxicated and cannot care for themselves or others. These individuals will not be allowed onto the bus, and Police and/or Fire may be summoned to assess individuals.</li>
<li>On Halloween Night, UCSC will operate Night Owl buses from downtown Santa Cruz (near 511 Cedar Street) approximately every 20 minutes from 11:30pm until a last departure from downtown at 1:30am. SCMTD Metro buses will operate on their regular service schedule Monday night, Oct. 31st, with the last Route 16 bus departing downtown at 12:07am to reach Science Hill at 12:25am before returning downtown at 12:47am.</li>
<li>Bus service from the downtown area may be limited and you may find yourself walking back up to campus. Should you have to walk back to campus, please remember to be good neighbors (i.e., respect the city noise ordinance, traffic laws and the property of others). Try to walk home with others as it can be very dark along several sections of the route back to campus.</li>
<li>Be advised that the downtown area has been designated a &#8220;triple fine&#8221; area for violations of city ordinances beginning on Sunday, Oct. 30th and extending through the early hours of Tuesday, Nov. 1. Should you be involved in any incident for which you are cited by the City of Santa Cruz Police, you will also be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for possible university judicial action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our colleagues from SHOP at the Student Health Center have provided tips for a safe Halloween both on and off campus. Please visit the SHOP News tab on <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/">their website</a> for more information.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to the above, the City of Santa Cruz Police Department has asked the university to share the following with students:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If you are planning to come to downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night, we ask that you have fun and behave responsibly. With the well-being of our residents and visitors in mind, the City has concentrated resources downtown to promote a safe environment that everyone can enjoy. This includes over 100 law enforcement officers from 9 agencies patrolling the downtown corridor and triple fines for certain violations of the Municipal Code. Triple fines and court costs make an alcoholic open container violation total $480, and littering almost $300.&#8221;</em><br/>
<br/>
 For your reference, information regarding the triple fine zone in the City of Santa Cruz is available <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2016/pdf/Halloween-downtown-regulations2016.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope that you have a fun and safe Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
 Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

<p>The campus was the only UC in the top 10. The top spot is held by College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine.</p>
<p>The Princeton Review said it developed the ranking list using data from its institutional survey for its green rating and its surveys of students attending the colleges. Ten data points from the institutional survey were factored into the assessment. Data from the student survey included student ratings of how sustainability issues influenced their education and life on campus; adminis&#173;tration and student support for environmental awareness and conservation efforts; and the visibility and impact of student environmental groups.</p>
<p>The campus is also included in the 2016 edition of the The Princeton Review Guide to 361 Green Colleges. The guide was first published in 2010.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fcfee74180727017030a023d603299b1"><name>kresge-renewal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to renew Kresge College</title><summary>Since February, a diverse committee of staff, faculty, and students has worked with a team led by Studio Gang Architects to explore prospects for a renewal of Kresge College’s complex and aging physical space. &#13;

<p>Since February, a diverse committee of staff, faculty, and students has worked with a team led by Studio Gang Architects to explore prospects for a renewal of Kresge College&#8217;s complex and aging physical space.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project places Kresge at a unique crossroads in its history,&#8221; Provost Ben Leeds Carson said, &#8220;offering us a unique opportunity for intensive conversation with the generations of self-determined and imaginative communities that form our roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, the committee has hosted a number of events and widely solicited the perspectives of Kresge&#8217;s past leaders, including former provosts and faculty, and alumni.</p>
<p>Kresge College&#8217;s buildings are nearing the end of their expected material lifespan, and deterioration is compounded by effects of the marine environment and other factors. Kresge College was built in 1973, the sixth college to be constructed at UC Santa Cruz. The housing sections of the five older colleges have been renovated.</p>
<p>The renewal of Kresge College is driven by the age of the college and expected signs of deterioration. However, it is also part of a broader campus effort to expand student housing on the west side of campus. Like with other college renovations, UC Santa Cruz is looking to increase the number of beds at Kresge&#8212;from 363 to about 500 or 600&#8212;while also soliciting feedback on ways to improve the student experience.</p>
<p>In an effort to address student demand, expand quality housing options, and address needed renovation of current housing units such as Family Student Housing, the campus is undertaking a housing initiative that will add up to 3,000 new beds. This project is part of UC President&#8217;s Housing Initiative and will likely be built through a public-private partnership; the Kresge project is being evaluated to understand how it integrates with the larger housing initiative and other efforts to provide additional classroom and academic space on campus.</p>
<p>The committee is co-chaired by Provost Ben Leeds Carson and Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham, and includes students, faculty, and staff. Concurrent community engagement workshops have been running since February when the committee&#8217;s work kicked off.</p>
<p>In May, the committee finalized a visioning brief that distilled goals for the project and lays out desired program elements&#8212;academic, residential and student support spaces. classroom, co-op, fitness, food service, gathering, study, administration, residential, and support.</p>
<p>Kresge College was designed by Charles Moore and William Turnbull, and built in 1973. In many respects, Kresge&#8217;s design and features were a watershed moment for postmodern architecture, implementing an impressive range of experimental approaches to living and learning environments. The college&#8217;s hilltop layout, inspired by medieval Italian hill-towns, along with its flexibility in integrating residential, social, and academic space, have been widely cited and admired in the architectural community.</p>
<p>However, many elements of the space that captured attention and praise in the college&#8217;s early years have proven challenging for many generations of students. The Kresge Project Committee has worked diligently to conceive of a future for the space that reimagines the Kresge environment in ways that will further the college&#8217;s founding ethos of collaborative and innovative design.</p>
<p>The campus is concluding the planning phase and will be studying a variety of approaches and options, with further opportunities for engagement once next steps are clarified.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fe044b7880727017030a023d0b0f78a4"><name>pedestrians-self-driving-cars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pedestrians may run rampant in a world of self-driving cars</title><summary>Imagine an urban neighborhood where most of the cars drive themselves.

 Actually, pretty good, according to Adam Millard-Ball, assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. In fact, pedestrians might end up with the run of the place.<br/>
<br/>
 In a new study, <a href="http://jpe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/0739456X16675674v1?ijkey=YhjH9rxcoubxQ&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spjpe">"Pedestrians, Autonomous Vehicles, and Cities,"</a> published online Wednesday (Oct. 26) in the <em>Journal of Planning Education and Research</em>, Millard-Ball looks at the prospect of urban areas where a majority of vehicles are &#8220;autonomous&#8221; or self-driving. It&#8217;s a phenomenon that&#8217;s not as far off as one might think.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform travel behavior,&#8221; Millard-Ball says. He uses game theory to analyze the interactions between pedestrians and<br/>
 self-driving vehicles, with a focus on yielding at crosswalks.<br/>
<br/>
 Because autonomous vehicles are by design risk-averse, Millard-Ball&#8217;s model suggests that pedestrians will be able to act with impunity, and he thinks autonomous vehicles may facilitate a shift towards pedestrian-oriented urban neighborhoods. However, Millard-Ball also finds that the adoption of autonomous vehicles may be hampered by their strategic disadvantage that slows them down in urban traffic.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Pedestrians routinely play the game of chicken,&#8221; Millard-Ball writes. Crossing the street, even at a marked crosswalk without a traffic signal, &#8220;requires an implicit, instantaneous probability calculation: what are the odds of survival?&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The benefit of crossing the street quickly, instead of taking a long detour or waiting for a gap in traffic, is traded off against the probability of injury or even death. Pedestrians know that drivers are not interested in running them down&#8212;usually. But there is the chance a driver may be distracted, drunk, or a sociopath.<br/>
<br/>
 Self-driving cars are programmed to obey the rules of the road, including waiting for pedestrians to cross. Secure in the knowledge that a car will yield, pedestrians merely need to act unpredictably or step into the street to force the risk-averse car to stop.<br/>
<br/>
 Self-driving cars could provide the most dramatic transformation in urban transportation systems, and the largest upheaval for transportation planning practice, since<br/>
 the arrival of the automobile more than a century ago, Millard-Ball says. Parking, street design, and transit and paratransit service networks are likely to be revolutionized.<br/>
<br/>
 Millard-Ball&#8217;s research links urban planning and environmental economics, with a focus on intersections between climate change and transportation policy. In a previous article, he looked at parking strategies in urban environments that might reduce the practice&#8212;and environmental costs&#8212;of circling the block to find an open spot.<br/>
<br/>
 In his latest study, he also suggests that the potential benefits of self-driving cars&#8212;avoiding tedium of traffic and trauma of collisions&#8212;may be outweighed by the drawbacks of an always play-it-safe vehicle that slows traffic for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;From the point of view of a passenger in an automated car, it would be like driving down a street filled with unaccompanied five-year-old children,&#8221; Millard-Ball writes.<br/>
<br/>
 The ultimate impacts of autonomous vehicles depend not only on technological advances and market adoption, but also on how planners and policy makers respond, Millard-Ball concludes. One approach would be to maintain traffic speeds by eliminating crosswalks, erecting fences between the sidewalk and roadway to corral pedestrians, and stepping up enforcement against jaywalkers.<br/>
<br/>
 Alternatively, planners could seize the opportunity to create more pedestrian-oriented streets, and relegate drop-offs to the fringes of urban commercial districts.<br/>
<br/>
 Autonomous vehicles could usher in a new era of pedestrian supremacy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://jpe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/0739456X16675674v1?ijkey=YhjH9rxcoubxQ&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spjpe</url><title>Pedestrians, Autonomous Vehicles,  and Cities</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fe2c91bb80727017030a023dc621abd3"><name>microcystin-toxin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Toxins from freshwater algae found in San Francisco Bay shellfish</title><summary>Study shows toxins from freshwater algal blooms can also contaminate coastal waters and marine shellfish.</summary><keywords>Raphael Kudela, Corinne Gibble, microcystin, shellfish toxins, harmful algal bloomss</keywords><start-date>1477465200000</start-date><display-name>Toxins from freshwater algae found in San Francisco Bay shellfish</display-name><path>/2016/10/microcystin-toxin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/microcystin-toxin</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1477438114966</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477495846521</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/kendra-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/kendra-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kendra-400.jpg</name><display-name>kendra-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>140102</file-size><width>400</width><height>413</height></image><image-alt>researcher collecting mussels</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/kendra-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/kendra-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kendra-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kendra-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21397</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher collecting mussels</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UCSC researcher Kendra Negrey collects mussels for research on the accumulation of freshwater toxins in shellfish.

Although shellfish harvested from California's coastal waters are monitored for toxins produced by marine algae, they are not routinely tested for this freshwater toxin, called microcystin.</p>
<p>The toxin, which causes liver damage, is produced by a type of cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) that thrives in warm, nutrient-rich water conditions. It has been found in many lakes and rivers in California, including the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, which flow into the San Francisco Bay Delta, and in several Bay Area lakes.</p>
<p>Raphael Kudela, the Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz, said his lab investigated the potential for microcystin to contaminate shellfish after detecting low levels of the toxin in water samples from San Francisco Bay. The researchers tested mussels collected from five sites in the Bay. They also did experiments with both mussels and oysters in tanks to determine how quickly the shellfish take up the toxin and how long it takes to clear it from their tissues. The results are published in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988316301639"><em>Harmful Algae</em></a>.</p>
<p>"We found that this freshwater toxin accumulates in shellfish, both mussels and oysters, and that in San Francisco Bay, the toxin levels in some mussels exceed the recommended guidelines for consumption by quite a bit," Kudela said.</p>
<p>The researchers also detected low levels of the toxin in commercial oysters from Tomales Bay, although the levels were well below the <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/peer_review/docs/calif_cyanotoxins/cyanotoxins053112.pdf">guidelines</a> for microcystin levels in fish. First author Corinne Gibble, who worked on the study as a UCSC graduate student and is now an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the findings suggest tests for microcystin should be added to existing shellfish monitoring programs.</p>
<p>"There is monitoring of shellfish for marine-derived toxins, but because this is a freshwater toxin no one has been looking for it. Now it seems microcystin is something we should be monitoring as well," Gibble said.</p>
<p>A state quarantine on harvesting of mussels for human consumption is usually in effect from May through October to prevent poisonings from marine toxins. Kudela said his lab has been working closely with state agencies, and they are continuing to conduct tests to determine the extent of the microcystin problem and the best way to address it.</p>
<p>"The agencies have been very responsive," he said. "There is potential for this toxin to affect humans, but most of our samples are still below the recommended limits for human consumption, so people shouldn't panic and think they can't eat shellfish."</p>
<p>A greater concern, he said, is the potential impact on marine mammals such as sea otters, which eat large amounts of shellfish. In 2010, Kudela and scientists with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/otter-toxin.html">reported that microcystin poisoning had killed several sea otters in Monterey Bay</a>.</p>
<p>"This really highlights the connectivity between what people do on land and what happens in the ocean," Kudela said. "A lot of shellfish farms are downstream from freshwater sources, so we want to raise awareness of this issue."</p>
<p>Blooms of the cyanobacteria that produce microcystin are a growing problem throughout the United States and around the world due to warming temperatures and nutrient pollution. Microcystin from algal blooms in Lake Erie, for example, contaminated the water supply for Toledo, Ohio, in 2014. In the Bay Area, it has forced closures of public swimming areas at Lake Anza in Berkeley and Lake Temescal in Oakland.</p>
<p>Kudela said he suspects the toxins detected in San Francisco Bay are coming from multiple sources, including the rivers that flow into the Delta as well as local sources. The drought appears to have exacerbated the problem throughout California, he said.</p>
<p>"The rains help by flushing things out. Warm, dry conditions favor these blooms, so we've been seeing more of them lately than we would without the drought," Kudela said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="02beb77e80727017030a023d5b1e04bb"><name>founders-celebration-2016-wrapup-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founders Celebration 2016 celebrates excellence, generosity, vision</title><summary>Hundreds of revelers turned UC Santa Cruz’s Science &amp; Engineering Library into a “collision space” of ideas during the 11th annual Founders Celebration, a time to celebrate excellence and generosity. </summary><start-date>1477514940000</start-date><display-name>founders celebration 2016 highlights</display-name><path>/2016/10/founders-celebration-2016-wrapup-feature</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/founders-celebration-2016-wrapup-feature</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1477514801728</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477517135807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/289962412&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width/><caption><span>The audio tribute for Founders Celebration 2016 Alumni Achievement Award winner Julie Snyder, former senior producer of <em>This American Life</em> and co-creator of the hit podcast <em>Serial</em>.

<p>The library is now undergoing a renovation, which is gradually transforming the building into a more vital and interactive space.</p>
<p>That vitality was very much in evidence during the celebration. Artful lighting in shades of red and blue, a dynamic troop of dancers, and strings of lights in the courtyard, transformed the library into a lively and thoughtful party space.</p>
<p>During her spirited and funny remarks to the crowd, Alumni Achievement Award honoree <strong>Julie Snyder</strong> (Kresge &#8217;95, politics), co-creator of the massively popular <em>Serial</em> podcast, made a confession: &#8220;In a bajillion years, I never could have pictured myself being the person who is up here on stage tonight because that is not how I saw myself when I was here: I was not a go-getter!&#8221;</p>
<p>Snyder, whose podcast unspools gripping true-life stories, is considered a journalistic pioneer. She, along with her co-creator Sarah Koenig, has found a way to blend riveting storytelling with hard-nosed reporting.</p>
<p>In that sense, Snyder is part of a longstanding tradition of journalists whose work is exhaustively researched but is every bit as engaging as great fiction. Snyder name-dropped fellow UC Santa Cruz grads Nikki Silva (Porter '73, aesthetic studies) and Lawrence Weschler (Cowell '74, philosophy and western civilization) and an amazing list of Pulitzer Prize winners who are fellow Banana Slugs: Hector Tobar (Oakes '85, Latin American studies/sociology), Dana Priest Merrill ('81, politics), &#160;Martha Mendoza (Kresge '88, journalism and education), and William Finnegan (Cowell, '74, English literature). <ins cite="mailto:Gwen%20Jourdonnais" datetime="2016-10-26T12:31"></ins></p>
<p>Considering that Snyder can now take her place among the most distinguished journalists who have graduated from UC Santa Cruz, it is humbling to realize that she wasn&#8217;t particularly &#8220;single-minded or ambitious&#8221; when she first arrived on campus.</p>
<p>On the upside, she found herself challenged all the time. Her takeaway from UC Santa Cruz was this: &#8220;Be fearless, be progressive, challenge the orthodoxy, question the status quo, and don&#8217;t just follow what others do and have always done. Truly listen to one another. Follow a new path.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spirit of UC Santa Cruz followed her as she launched her broadcasting career at <em>This American Life.</em> That same spirit helped guide her hand two years ago when she started <em>Serial</em> with Koenig.</p>
<p>Little did Snyder know that <em>Serial</em>, shortly after its debut, would reach 5 million downloads&#8212;the fastest podcast download rate in iTunes history&#8212;or that the show would approach a total of 253 million downloads after the first two seasons, drawing listeners from every country in the world except North Korean and Eritrea. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Eritrea&#8217;s problem is!&#8221; Snyder joked.</p>
<p>Snyder did her best to explain <em>Serial&#8217;</em>s massive popularity. She believes that &#8220;the part of the brain that reacted to shows like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em> lit up when listening to <em>Serial,</em> but this wasn&#8217;t entertainment, it was journalism. It was real, and people weren&#8217;t used to responding to journalism that way. And the question became, &#8216;What is this? This must be something new, and is this OK to do with a nonfiction story? Is it too entertaining? Is this responsible?' I would say artistry is OK in reporting as long as you&#8217;re sticking to the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Emotional addresses</strong></p>
<p>Another emotional high point was the awarding of the Faculty Research Award to UC Santa Cruz linguistics professor&#160;<strong>Sandra Chung,</strong>&#160;who was recognized for her work focusing on 1,200 related languages spoken on Pacific island archipelagos&#8212;especially Chamorro, an understudied language of the Mariana Islands. She said the award really belonged to the speakers of the Pacific languages. She also acknowledged her late father, Harold Chung, who she described as a &#8220;college drop-out from a different University of California campus&#8221; who started out as a lab assistant. &#8220;I hope some part of his spirit of scientific inquiry continues in my research,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He would have been delighted to be here tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the evening, the&#160;<strong>Helen and Will Webster Foundation</strong>&#160;was honored with the Fiat Lux Award. Claudia and Alec Webster (Rachel Carson College '02, environmental studies) help steward the foundation. They accepted the award on behalf of the foundation.</p>
<p>The Websters are well-known on campus for their generosity and vision. Their philanthropy named and endowed the newly rededicated Rachel Carson College (formerly College Eight), and established five endowed chairs.</p>
<p>The Websters are also known for their intervention to save the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, which was on the verge of collapse before they funded an ambitious rebuilding project. The barn is now a center for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s environmental and sustainability programs, home to the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and a campus and community hub.</p>
<p>Claudia Webster said that Helen and Will Webster have been &#8220;incredibly brave&#8221; in their vision for UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;In doing so, they have opened the world to us beyond anything I would have ever aspired to. It brings me to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Directing her remarks to the UC Santa Cruz community, Webster continued: &#8220;I truly believe you don&#8217;t understand how important you are, how much goodness you bring to the world, the work you do that is so needed. I asked (University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell), &#8216;Can you even wrap your mind around the talent and brains that are in the room tonight? I could start naming names but we&#8217;d be here all evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia Webster said that a foundation could give money to any number of good causes, &#8220;and we have tried, but we keep coming back to UC Santa Cruz and&#160;the Santa Cruz community.

An expert in French history, he is currently president-elect of the American Historical Association, the largest professional organization in the country devoted to the study of history.</p>
<p>He was also recently featured in a <em>Time</em> magazine story titled &#8220;25 Moments That Changed America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now beginning his second full academic year as dean, we sat down with Dean Stovall to discuss the state of the humanities at UC Santa Cruz and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What were some of the highlights of your first year as dean of the humanities at UC Santa Cruz?</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<strong>A.</strong> I have to say there were a number of highlights: The visit of William "Bro" Adams, chair of the NEH and UCSC History of Consciousness Ph.D., was definitely a landmark moment in highlighting the importance of the humanities to UCSC.&#160;The fact that we were able to acquire endowed faculty chairs in Literature, Jewish Studies, and Feminist Studies underscored the high renown in which our faculty and research are held in the broader community.&#160;Additionally, the tremendous outpouring of support for History's Gail Project on Giving Day, illustrated the importance of undergraduate research in our division.&#160;Finally, our ability to bring in some excellent new staff, in particular our new assistant dean Adrienne Harrell, shows that people across campus view the Humanities Division as a good place to work.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What can we expect in the coming year? Tell us about some of your future plans and goals for the division.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#160;A.</strong> To a large extent, I wish to continue our progress with some of the initiatives from this past year, in particular working with our Institute for Humanities Research. I want to continue the work of making Humanities more visible, not just at UCSC, but throughout the broader Santa Cruz community.&#160;We will continue our very successful "Questions That Matter" series looking at how humanistic themes inform contemporary issues.&#160;We are also, along with the Graduate Division, working on an NEH planning grant to provide support and training for humanities Ph.D.s who wish to pursue careers outside academia.&#160;I am also looking forward to bringing new faculty into the division, especially in History of Consciousness and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. Let&#8217;s talk about your research. What are you currently working on?</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<strong>A.</strong> My major project is a large study of the intersections of ideas of freedom and race in modern history, primarily in America and France but on a global scale.&#160;I'm interested in exploring the ways in which our ideas of freedom are racially coded.&#160;I'm also working on a smaller project, a spin-off of my textbook <em>Transnational France</em>, which will consist of a series of focused essays on French history in world perspective.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. You were recently asked by <em>Time</em> magazine to choose a pivotal moment in the last 50 years of our nation&#8217;s history. As a historian, what is your take on the world right now in 2016? Do you think this year will be seen in retrospect as a pivotal moment in our country&#8217;s history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It's of course hard to say what future perspectives will be, but I think both the victory of Brexit in the United Kingdom, and the success of Donald Trump's campaign for president, highlight the importance of globalization as well as immigration and racial difference in the contemporary era.&#160;It is paradoxical that those who have benefited most from a globalized economy have often trumpeted the values of diversity, while those who have suffered from free trade and globalization in countries like the U.S. and UK often point to immigration as a major problem.&#160;Constructing a new vision, and practices, of globalization that both promote diversity and at the same time protect the victims of globalized economics is the primary political need of our time.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What role do you think the humanities can have in helping to solve some of the world&#8217;s most pressing problems of the day?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Historians like to say there is nothing new under the sun, and an awareness of the ways in which humanity has faced similar problems in the past is crucial to being able to overcome them. The work of humanists in understanding and learning to articulate differences of all kinds helps us confront the world as it is, in all its messiness, rather than retreating into self-contained models of society.&#160;Above all, our understanding that the pressing problems of the day are deeply political, and can only be addressed as such, is the only way ultimately to solve those problems.<strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>

<br/>
 The exhibition offers a look at astronomy and the celestial cosmos through two distinct lenses&#8212;one artistic and contemporary, the other scientific and historical.<br/>
<br/>
 It joins the work of Russell Crotty, an artist with an abiding passion for astronomy, with an installation of never-before-exhibited artifacts and images from one of the nation&#8217;s most historic observatories, UC Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.<br/>
<br/>
 The title of the exhibition has a dual meaning. First, it refers to &#8216;lookback time&#8217;--the fact that the light that reaches our telescopes shows us images from the past--the greater the distance the light has traveled, the older the image. Second, the exhibit looks back at the early years of astronomy at Lick.<br/>
<br/>
 Crotty is known internationally for his drawings based on direct astronomical observation, and for works on landscape, the ocean, and surfing. This exhibition premiers a large-scale, site-specific installation, created in response to his time as an IAS artist-in-residence at Lick Observatory and UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 <em>Look Back in Time</em> also digs into the history of astronomy, unveiling an array of artifacts from Lick&#8217;s historical collections. Selected and displayed in an installation created by the Observatory&#8217;s collections director, Tony Misch, these artifacts provide a look into the processes of late 19th and early 20th century observational astronomy.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The instruments, photographic plates, and written records in Lick's historical collections conceal a special poetry in their documentation of the laborious and painstaking work of astronomical observation,&#8221; noted Misch, co-curator of the exhibition with Crotty and IAS director John Weber.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This wonderful opportunity to exhibit the archival materials in an art gallery context invites viewers to reflect on astronomical data-gathering, with all its precision and quantitative rigor, as the creative work of individual hands and minds,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>The <em>Look Back in Time</em></strong> exhibition is the culmination of an innovative two-year collaboration between the ICA, IAS, University of California Observatories (UCO), the Lick Observatory Historical Collections Project, and Theoretical Astrophysics Santa Cruz, a faculty working group at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 According to Cathy Kimball, ICA&#8217;s Executive Director, &#8220;This project represents a model partnership between a public university and an urban, non-profit contemporary art space, demonstrating the value of collaborations that leverage the research capacities of higher education in the service of public arts programming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimball collaborated on the exhibition&#8217;s concept and extended the original invitation to the IAS to develop a joint project.<br/>
<br/>
 When approached by the IAS about an exhibition, Crotty was attracted by the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with modern and historic telescopes at Lick, gain access to its historical archive, and engage with astronomers and astrophysicists both at Lick and on campus.<br/>
<br/>
 Along with repeat visits to the observatory, he met on campus with faculty involved in theoretical astrophysics to discuss their work. He visited the Lick Shops on campus where telescopes are designed, optics fabricated, and instruments built. He toured the Center for Adaptive Optics where the next generation of AO technologies is being pioneered. And he met with art classes.<br/>
<br/>
 Crotty also helped plan and present an intensive, two-day art and astronomy workshop for undergraduate art and science students at Lick Observatory.<br/>
<br/>
 The result of his time at Lick and on campus is a new installation based loosely on current theories about the development of the universe, from just after the Big Bang to the present. Crotty&#8217;s new piece takes the form of an immersive, walk-in environment that includes drawing, sculpture, and fabric scrims coated with bio-resin.<br/>
<br/>
 &#160;It will be on view for the first time at the ICA, together with a group of Crotty&#8217;s earlier work, selected by the artist to relate to areas of the cosmos studied historically at Lick.<br/>
<br/>
 "What we have created together is a show that combines the contemporary with the historical, and art with science history,&#8221; noted IAS director John Weber. &#8220;There are a lot of stories in this show, which is ultimately about the incredible drive humankind has had to understand the nature of the universe itself, and to express it. Lick Observatory expresses that drive, and so does Russell's work."<br/>
<br/>

Students, faculty, and staff are eligible to create fundraising projects.</p>
<p>Giving Day is a 24-hour online fundraising event to increase support for campus programs, projects, and groups.&#160;Project teams reach out to their network of supporters and friends to raise money and compete for prize dollars.</p>
<p>Last year, more than 60 campus projects were featured. Collectively, they raised $339,276 from 2,989 donors in a single day. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Organizers are encouraging interested campus groups to identify and register their projects now. Early registration increases opportunities to identify matching funds for projects. &#160;Last year, more than 20 projects had donor-sponsored matching funds that inspired others by matching gifts dollar-for-dollar.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s event, challenge prizes provided half a dozen opportunities for projects to win prizes ranging from $500 to $10,000 by attracting the highest number of donors in a specified amount of time.</p>
<p>Already, 22 projects are registered for Giving Day 2017.&#160;<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLbsq1Zv3q1nshuHS_gKwtsaj6fAzclQ_XgkpayM0_hRgpBw/viewform">Register your project now!</a></p>
<p>Projects registered on or before end of day Thursday also have a chance to win $100 prizes toward their project in our early-entry raffle.</p>

<p>Our 2016-2017 Winter Campus Curtailment is scheduled for Friday, December 23, 2016 through Monday, January 2, 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>December 23, 26, 30 and January 2 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</li>
<li>December 27, 28 and 29 are not paid university holidays</li>
</ul>
<p>These curtailment days may result in employees using vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for December 27, 28 and 29, 2016. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation, up to three days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accruals during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.</p>
<p>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus curtailment.</p>
<p>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate Staff HR Representative for time and payroll accounting purposes.</p>
<p>If you are not enrolled in Direct Deposit, you can pick up your 12/28/16 paycheck at the Payroll Office, located at 2300 Delaware Avenue, from 9am - 11am on Wednesday, 12/28/16. You must present a valid picture ID to get your paycheck. Paychecks not picked up on 12/28/16 will be delivered to your campus unit on Wednesday, 1/4/17. Checks will not be available for pick-up on 1/3/17 because they will be in transit to Mail Services for delivery processing.</p>
<p>Information on Direct Deposit, including directions on how to enroll, is <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Frequently asked questions regarding the campus curtailment and time reporting for staff employees <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/curtailment/Winter-Curtailment-QA-2016-2017.pdf">may be read online</a>.</p>
<p>Questions concerning academic employees should be directed to your <a href="http://apo.ucsc.edu/contacts/index.html">divisional academic personnel coordinator</a>.</p>
<p>For questions regarding staff employees, please contact your appropriate <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">Staff HR representative</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: The effects of winter curtailment for exclusively represented employees are subject to collective bargaining.</p>

 Re: Open Enrollment 2017</p>
<p>The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins today (Thursday, Oct. 27), and ends at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 22. Changes made become effective Jan. 1, 2017. This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, decide whether to make any changes, and enroll/re-enroll in a flexible spending account.</p>
<p>OE Booklets were mailed to home addresses this week (if you haven't received a booklet or were hired after Aug. 31, 2016 you can contact the campus Benefits Office for a copy. Call <a href="tel:831-459-2013">831-459-2013</a>). All Open Enrollment information is <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/">also online</a>. Follow the links to 2017 Open Enrollment information.</p>
<p>While there are some administrative changes, there are few benefit changes to our health plans this year. However, it is always a good idea to review the Open Enrollment booklet and consider all of your available choices. Also, this year there is the introduction of a new disability plan that takes effect on Jan. 1, 2017. This opens a one-time opportunity to add disability coverage, without a Statement of Health, for those who currently do not have supplemental disability coverage. And for those who have supplemental disability coverage, the new plan offers options to tailor your coverage to your needs.</p>
<p>Some highlights concerning the new disability plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage expanded to employees with Core or Mid-Level benefits</li>
<li>New employee paid will be called "Voluntary" rather than "Supplemental"</li>
<li>One standard 14-day waiting period rather than four different periods</li>
<li>For optional coverage, employee can choose to purchase: 
<ul>
<li>Only Voluntary Short-term Disability (VSTD)</li>
<li>Only Voluntary Long-term Disability (VLTD)</li>
<li>Both VSTD and VLTD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voluntary Long Term Disability will begin after 6 months rather than one year</li>
<li>Age limit on Voluntary Long Term Disability will be one's Social Security Normal Retirement Age</li>
</ul>
<p>Systemwide, the same suite of plans available in 2016 will continue in 2017. However, UCSC employees living in Santa Cruz County will have access to the Kaiser Permanente plan for the first time, as Kaiser will be opening offices in the county.</p>
<p>The Office of the President worked diligently to hold down costs for faculty and staff while continuing to provide a full array of plan choices. Most employees will see an increase of less than $6 in their monthly premiums. UC Care members will see substantial decreases. The university will continue to pay the larger share of medical plan premiums. The plan premiums <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/resources/employee-plan-costs.html">can be found online</a>. In addition, the university will continue to cover 100 percent of the premium cost for the vision and dental plans for employees and dependents.</p>
<p>Some other 2017 changes include:<br/>
 All four pay bands have been adjusted upward<br/>
 PPO plans will be administered by Anthem Blue Cross (instead of Blue Shield of California)<br/>
 The behavioral health network for our PPOs plans will be Anthem Blue Cross (instead of Optum)<br/>
 Our PPO plans (UC Care, Health Saving and Core) will use Optum Rx as their pharmacy manager.<br/>
 ARAG (legal plan) will have a slight increase (39-59 cents/month) and will add benefits related to tax planning, administrative hearings, and domestic violence support orders and is open for enrollment.<br/>
 Employee Supplemental Life rates will decrease 7.4 percent<br/>
 Dependent Basic and Expanded Life rates will decrease 7.5 percent<br/>
 These changes and other information are detailed in the OE information found in your OE Booklet and on-line at <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/</a></p>
<p>The UCSC Benefits Office will also provide the campus with a number of OE presentations, some will be general presentations that will be an overview of all changes and some presentations will focus on the new UC disability plan. The schedule is below and will be available at the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/ben_news/oe_2017.html">UCSC SHR website</a>.</p>
<p>Please be sure to note which presentation is being offered before deciding to attend one.</p>

</ul>
<p>UC continues to offer several medical plans to choose from. Each plan provides comprehensive coverage, including behavioral health benefits. But the cost, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as provider choice and flexibility to use out-of-network doctors and hospitals, varies significantly. And if you plan to retire during 2017, please remember that the medical plan that you choose will carry into retirement, in most cases.</p>
<p>Please take time to review your 2017 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs. If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation. For individual assistance, please contact the campus Benefits Office at <a href="tel:831-459-2013">831-459-2013</a>.</p>

<p>El periodo anual de Inscripcion Abierta (Open Enrollment [OE] en Ingles) comienza hoy, jueves, 27 de octubre, y termina a las 5 de la tarde del martes, 22 de noviembre. Esta es la epoca del ano para revisar sus beneficios de salud y bienestar, decidir si quiere hacer algun cambio, e inscribirse/re-inscribirse en una cuenta de gastos flexibles (flexible spending account [FSA] en Ingles). Los folletos de Inscripcion Abierta fueron enviados a los domicilios particulares esta semana (si usted no ha recibido el folleto o fue contratado despues del 31 de agosto de 2016, puede ponerse en contacto con la Oficina de Beneficios del campus para conseguir una copia del folleto-llame al 9-2013). Toda la informacion sobre la Inscripcion Abierta estara tambien en linea: comience en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/</a> y en espanol en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/es/index.html">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/es/index.html</a> y siga los enlaces para la pagina de Inscripcion Abierta 2017 (2017 Open Enrollment en Ingles).</p>
<p>Aunque hay algunos cambios administrativos, hay pocos cambios en las prestaciones a nuestros planes de salud este ano sin embargo, siempre es una buena idea revisar el folleto de inscripcion abierta y considerar todas sus opciones disponibles.</p>
<p>Ademas, este ano se ve la introduccion de un nuevo plan de disibilidad que entra en vigor el 01 de enero de 2017, esto abre una oportunidad unica para agregar la cobertura de disibilidad, sin una declaracion de salud, para aquellos que actualmente no tienen cobertura de discapacidad suplementaria. Y para aquellos que hoy ya tienen cobertura suplementaria de la disibilidad, el nuevo plan ofrece nuevos opciones para adaptar su cobertura a sus necesidades.</p>
<p>Algunos puntos destacados sobre el nuevo plan de discapacidad incluyen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cobertura para los empleados con beneficios de base o nivel medio</li>

<p>La Universidad de California sigue ofreciendo varios planes medicos para elegir. Cada plan ofrece una cobertura completa, incluyendo beneficios de salud conductual. Pero el costo, tanto en terminos de primas y gastos propios, y la eleccion y flexibilidad de proveedores (incluyendo el uso de doctores y hospitales fuera de la red) varia significativamente. Y si usted esta planeando retirarse en el 2017, por favor recuerde que el plan medico que eligio es el plan medico que llevara al retiro, en la mayoria de los casos.</p>
<p>Por favor, dedique tiempo para revisar sus opciones para el ano 2017 y elija el plan medico que mejor se ajusta a sus necesidades. Si tiene preguntas o necesita ayuda con sus decisiones de inscripcion, considere asistir a una de las presentaciones de Inscripcion Abierta.

Courses and program statements must be developed and go through an approval process. Catalogs must be composed and published. Classes must be scheduled. Navigation of these cumbersome processes always requires extensive effort.</p>
<p>The Curriculum Management Project at UC Santa Cruz aims to streamline and improve the systems used to manage campus curriculum and create course catalogs.</p>
<p>This project affects nearly everyone on campus involved in academics: students, faculty, and academic staff. The project team wants to reach out to as many people as possible in the academic community to ensure what the team builds meets campus needs.</p>
<p>To aid in this, the team has created three surveys: one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMPNt_dRShfkmSF3uq9Xl2CY1dAmpnFQ5rmForUE6WGrSsBA/viewform">undergraduate students</a>, one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOs8eGpdOLk1XDThyEyC1FCbtTIYLiI4TBEUTJXwc08vChmQ/viewform">graduate students</a>, and one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesDKDQuuIaYMCAFS48m9kQD3fgKnEhaaM4kGRh_fDEZIAd-Q/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=send_form">faculty/staff</a>.</p>
<p>The project team encourages everyone in the academic community to visit the <a href="https://cm.ue.ucsc.edu">project website</a>, fill out the survey, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/d/forum/cm-updates-group/join">sign up</a> to receive regular updates on the project.</p>
<h3>Why the project is needed</h3>
<p>The systems used to manage curriculum and create catalogs are outdated. There is a lot of manual work that can be automated, and the systems involved do not talk well to each other, requiring extra effort to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>The Curriculum Management Project aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve student experience with timely and accurate class, lab, and section scheduling</li>
<li>Improve student experience with an interactive and searchable catalog</li>
<li>Eliminate duplicate processes and multiple points of data entry</li>
<li>Eliminate multiple handoffs and manual processing</li>
<li>Improve accuracy</li>
<li>Improve student success through increased time for direct advising</li>
<li>Free up faculty and staff time to support student retention and time-to-degree initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>The project, overseen by the Office of the Registrar in the Division of Undergraduate Education, in collaboration with Information Technology Services, the Academic Senate, and a multitude of offices and individuals across campus, began on Oct. 17 and will require two to three years to complete.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cc8d6ab8072701752a34ca34bd19800"><name>quarry-restoration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to kick-off Quarry Amphitheater restoration</title><summary>One of the key priorities in the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, the amphitheater will be restored and reopened for fall 2017.</summary><keywords>quarry, Amphitheater, restoration, student life, </keywords><start-date>1477929600000</start-date><display-name>Quarry</display-name><path>/2016/10/quarry-restoration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/10/quarry-restoration</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1477951672707</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1478478712719</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/quarry.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/quarry.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>quarry.jpg</name><display-name>quarry.jpg</display-name><file-size>75478</file-size><width>300</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/10/images/quarry-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/10/images/quarry-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>quarry-80px.jpg</name><display-name>quarry-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12670</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz leaders will break ground&#160;at noon Thursday, Nov. 3, on the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/student-experience/the-quarry-amphitheater/">historic Quarry Amphitheater&#8217;s restoration</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its central role in campus life since its opening in 1967, the amphitheater fell into disrepair. As a result, events were discontinued in 2006 leaving a void in the heart of campus.</p>
<p>As part of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, the amphitheater will be restored and reopened for fall 2017. The $8 million project was largely supported by the Student Fee Advisory Committee, which gave $6.388 million to move the effort forward. Alumni, faculty, staff, students, and donors also pitched in to get the project moving forward. UC Santa Cruz will continue to raise funds to support the Quarry Ampitheather&#8217;s revival.</p>
<p>&#8220;As campus provost, the reopening of our beautiful Quarry Amphitheater has been among my top priorities,&#8221; Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said. &#8220;First opened in 1966, the Quarry Amphitheater has been closed for nearly 10 years. It served beautifully as the site for the university&#8217;s signature and unifying events and will do so again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carved from a former working quarry amidst redwoods and rocky outcroppings, the amphitheater dramatically showcases the deep connection between the campus, its history, and the natural landscape. Designed in the early &#8217;60s by modernist landscape architect Robert Royston, its asymmetrical terraces and sunny park-like character highlight the surroundings.</p>
<p>Plans for restoring the amphitheater envision a newly invigorated, inviting cultural space that retains its natural beauty. While some features will be upgraded, one that will be taken back to its original state is &#8220;the rock,&#8221; an outcropping that dramatically pierces the stage.</p>
<p>The project feasibility study calls for both restoration and new enhancements. The initial construction will provide accessibility, building code, life safety, and basic operational upgrades to support performances, events and casual daily use of the venue.</p>
<p>Additionally, seating will be expanded from current 1,636 to 2,000; stairs, ramps, handrails, lighting, and overall access will be improved; and provisions will be made for portable infrastructure to support events.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://giving.ucsc.edu/profiles/students/cowell_students_quarry.html</url><title>Cowell students’ fundraising for Quarry turns $2,000 into $30,000</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2c76641e8072701752a34ca38f38c759"><name>quarry-amphitheater-groundbreak-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Quarry story: A new chapter begins</title><summary>Fans of the Quarry Amphitheater, long closed for safety reasons, gathered on Thursday to celebrate groundbreaking for upcoming renovations.

<p>As the Black Eyed Peas song of the same name boomed in the background, Galloway alighted from the backhoe, looking giddy, wearing a robin&#8217;s eggshell&#8211;blue construction hat.</p>
<p>It was a fittingly dramatic and irreverent moment at the groundbreaking ceremony for the beloved and soon-to-be-renovated amphitheater, a stunning outdoor gathering space located in a once-active quarry operation where limestone was extracted to make mortar for brick buildings in San Francisco and throughout the west.</p>
<p>As Galloway told the crowd, shortly before dashing off to drive that backhoe, the $8 million project got an astounding $6.4 million boost from the Student Fee Advisory Committee. &#8220;We only went to them for half the money they actually gave us!&#8221; said Galloway. She also mentioned alumni, staff, faculty, and community contributions as well as the hard work of the TKE fraternity, &#8220;which came in and did a lot of grunt work cleaning up the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funds will go toward bringing the space back to its former glory, but with modern amenities. Workers will replace the benches, while keeping the place&#8217;s unique asymmetry. They will expand the seating from a capacity of 1,636 to 2,000, stabilize the rock walls, make the structure current with building codes and accessibility requirements, introduce lighting for night events, and, at the request of students, put in WiFi. Galloway said she hoped the renovated amphitheater opens next fall.</p>
<p>Alice Malmberg, current UC Santa Cruz student and representative for the Student Fee Advisory Committee, praised previous members of that group for stepping up and showing their commitment. &#8220;It is such an incredible amount of money for a project that would not even be completed by the time they graduated,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking was also emotional for alumni from as far back as the late 1960s and 1970s. Sara Puhl, who works at McHenry Library, is the daughter of a UC Santa Cruz alumna. She remembers visiting the amphitheater as a kid. &#8220;My brother and I used to run up and down the stairs here,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;We were free range.&#8221;</p>
<p>The histories of this gathering space, and the campus as a whole, are closely linked.</p>
<p>When UC Santa Cruz opened to students in 1965, Chancellor Dean McHenry saw the space&#8217;s potential as a central gathering space. He hired noted landscape architect Robert Royston, who created the famous and eye-catching asymmetrical arrangement of benches and shape of the amphitheater, serving as a kind of visual echo to the quarry&#8217;s sheer and angular walls with redwoods sprouting out of them.</p>
<p>Construction finished up in 1967, and for nearly 40 years this was the key place to go for big events.</p>
<p>Music boomed, Vietnam War protesters chanted, and Alfred Hitchcock regaled his fans with stories about moviemaking. But the site fell into disrepair and was shuttered in 2006.</p>
<p>All too often, the place has been a little too quiet since then. That changed in a big way on Thursday's ceremony with the entrance of the graceful UC Santa Cruz Kahaani dance troupe, which brings eye-catching and stylish Hindi-film dancing to the campus and beyond.</p>
<p>It was a fitting occasion for a space that is enthralling whether it is being filled with raucous music, or whether it is empty except for a few visitors and students enjoying a break from the bustle or catching up on their coursework.</p>
<p>Dean Fitch, the campus's landscape architect, stood near the top of the big bowl and looked down on the rocks and the forest below.</p>
<p>The space feels magical because of the spatial qualities, the volume, and the big rocks massing at the bottom, he said. &#8220;The quarry walls you in.
