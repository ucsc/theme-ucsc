<p>The sale offers a wide range of colorful, water-wise succulents, small trees, and other plants from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and California. This year, many of the featured plants attract birds, particularly hummingbirds, and most of them can't be found at local nurseries or elsewhere in the state. Gardening experts are available at the sale to answer questions about plants and offer advice to ensure they thrive. Food and beverages will also be available for purchase.</p>
<p>Featured plants at this year's sale include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Arctostaphylos insularis</em></strong> <strong>'Ward':</strong> A native manzanita from Santa Cruz Island and a great plant for hedges and landscapes, <em>Arctostaphylos insularis</em> is a shrub that grows 6 to 12 feet in height. It flowers from winter into spring and produces pinkish-white flowers that nicely accent the mahogany bark and green leaves.</li>
<li><strong><em>Prostanthera baxteri</em></strong> <strong>'Lavender Moon':</strong> An evergreen shrub native to Australia, <em>Prostanthera baxteri</em> produces silver-green leaves and colorful purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Ideal conditions for the plant are in sunlight or slight shade. It grows to 3 to 4 feet.</li>
<li><strong><em>Boronia crenulata</em></strong> <strong>'Rosy Splendor':</strong> An aromatic Australian shrub, <em>Boronia cenulata</em> 'Rosy Splendor' came to the Arboretum by way of the Koala Blooms program, a partnership between the Arboretum and nurseries to bring native Australian plants to California. <em>Boronia crenulata</em> is ideal as a container plant and can be used as a border plant or in rock gardens. It will thrive in either direct sunlight or dappled shade and produces bright pink flowers that bloom in the spring.</li>
<li><strong><em>Penstemon spectabilis:</em></strong> An evergreen perennial native to California, <em>Penstemon spectabilis</em> grows to a height of about 3 feet and produces violet flowers which bloom from spring to summer and attract hummingbirds. It is a drought tolerant plant that does well in sun or partial shade.</li>
<li><strong><em>Leucospermum</em></strong> <strong>'Spider':</strong> A large shrub native to South Africa, <em>Leucospermum</em> produces eye-catching "pincushion" flowers that bloom in the early spring to summer months. It does well in full sun and is drought tolerant. It can be pruned to maintain a smaller size. The bright flowers are a salmon color with red and orange tipped stamens that will add a pop of color to any garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>The annual event is made possible by the tireless efforts of Arboretum staff organizers and hundreds of energetic volunteers who work all year growing the plants. "Our plant sales are a cooperative adventure between the Arboretum's fine staff and wonderful volunteers. The sale would be almost impossible to hold without the hard work of all of us," said Phyllis Norris, a long-time volunteer.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the Arboretum's plant sale is a joint event with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). For Arboretum and CNPS members only, the sale opens at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 9. The public sale starts at noon. Memberships can be purchased <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">online</a> before the sale or at the gate on the day of the sale.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 502-2998 or visit <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-10-2016</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-folder

scientists will fan out across the UC Santa Cruz campus and Younger Lagoon Reserve on Saturday, April 30, to explore and document the area's remarkable biodiversity in the first <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ucsc-bioblitz">UCSC Bioblitz</a>.</p>
<p>A bioblitz is a community event that brings together a wide variety of people to rapidly inventory the living organisms found in a particular place. The UCSC Bioblitz, organized by the <a href="http://ucsantacruz.ucnrs.org/">UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves</a>, the <a href="http://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/index.html">Ken Norris Center for Natural History</a>, and the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a>, will take place on <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/">Alumni Weekend</a>, along with a concurrent bioblitz at <a href="http://ucsantacruz.ucnrs.org/reserves/younger-lagoon/">Younger Lagoon Reserve</a> on the UCSC Coastal Science Campus. Participants can register for one or both of these events on the <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2089&amp;cid=3848">Alumni Weekend registration site</a>.</p>
<p>"It's an opportunity for students, alumni and their families, and community members to engage with faculty and staff experts, enjoy the outdoors, and explore the natural history of our incredible campus," said Alex Jones, manager of the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve.</p>
<p>The UCSC Bioblitz will have two shifts, morning and afternoon, and participants can join either or both. The morning shift (9 a.m. to 1 p.m.) will meet at the UCSC Arboretum at the Horticulture 2 building, and the afternoon shift (2 p.m. to 6 p.m.) will meet at the Ken Norris Center for Natural History in the Natural Sciences 2 building (room 239). The Younger Lagoon Bioblitz takes place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and meets at Long Marine Laboratory.</p>
<p>Expertise in natural history is not required to participate, Jones said. The bioblitz will use a citizen science platform called <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, supported by the California Academy of Sciences, that includes a free app for smart phones and tablets. Teams will work together to find and identify as many different species as possible in UCSC's wide variety of natural habitats. After taking photographs and geographically pinpointing their findings, the teams will come back together at the end of each shift to upload their records, share stories, and help each other with identifications.</p>
<p>"The California Academy of Sciences has an active citizen science program, and they do a lot of these events. They'll have staff members here to help and guide us through the process," Jones said.</p>
<p>The bioblitz will give UCSC Natural Reserves staff a better sense of the distribution of species on campus, he said. The results will also provide data that could be useful for researchers. The iNaturalist platform shares findings with scientific data repositories like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to help scientists find and use the data.</p>

researchers seeking information on BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene variants</article-subhead><article-text><p>A team at the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> working with the BRCA Challenge, a demonstration project of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a> (GA4GH), has developed an important new resource, the BRCA Exchange web portal, which brings together genomic and clinical data on the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.</p>
<p>BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, and certain mutations in them increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers. They are now among the most thoroughly studied genes in the human genome, and thousands of variants of each gene (versions with small differences in their DNA sequences) have been identified. Some variants are harmless or benign, others are deleterious, and for many variants the clinical significance remains uncertain.</p>
<p>BRCA Challenge is an international effort to advance understanding of these genes and their role in cancer by pooling all of the available genomic and clinical data. Improved understanding of genetic variation in these genes has the potential to improve patient diagnoses and disease prevention.</p>
<p>The BRCA Exchange is the first product of the BRCA Challenge, which released the newest version of the web portal on Sunday, April 3, in advance of the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.ichg2016.org/index.html">International Congress of Human Genetics</a> (ICHG) in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>"As a result of this global effort, we were able to create the largest database of BRCA data in the world, providing a comprehensive resource that people can refer to when they get the results of a genetic test and want to know the clinical significance of particular BRCA gene variants," said UC Santa Cruz research scientist Benedict Paten, who led the Genomics Institute's work on the BRCA Exchange.</p>
<p><strong>International collaboration</strong></p>
<p>David Haussler, scientific director of the Genomics Institute and a cofounder of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, noted that international collaboration is essential to realize the full potential of genomic data. "The BRCA Exchange is a significant milestone in advancing the Global Alliance's mission of enabling the sharing of genomic and clinical data to improve human health," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The BRCA Exchange is a publicly accessible web portal that provides a simple interface for patients, clinicians, and researchers to access curated expert interpretations and some supporting evidence for genetic variants identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Since its initial beta launch in October 2015, the BRCA Exchange has supported clinical decision-making by allowing any web user to search all BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants that have been classified by the international <a href="http://enigmaconsortium.org/">ENIGMA consortium</a> and to easily access the background rationale for classification.</p>
<p>"The BRCA Challenge project represents the most comprehensive effort to date to pool BRCA variants from multiple international databases as a vehicle to provide supporting evidence for BRCA variant classifications in the public domain," said Amanda Spurdle, chair of the ENIGMA consortium steering committee and Head of the Molecular Cancer Epidemiology Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.</p>
<p>The new release will include an additional tier that allows web users, after agreeing to a disclaimer and data use policy, to interact with data on genetic variants that have not yet been expert classified and whose clinical significance is therefore not yet understood. This represents the first time that all publicly available BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant data contained in databases such as ClinVar, LOVD, ExAC, and the 1000 Genomes Project have been pooled in a single, federated resource.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Collective knowledge</strong></p>
<p>The exchange allows researchers, clinicians, and others to simultaneously search across the world's collective knowledge on the genes. The updated portal integrates information on more than 13,000 genetic variants from several national databases.</p>
<p>"We are pleased that after such a short period, we have already received feedback from users around the world who have accessed the portal for understanding BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants," said Stephen Chanock, director of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and co-chair of the BRCA Challenge's Steering Committee.</p>
<p>The BRCA Exchange will enable the development of a federated network to share BRCA data using the application programming interface (API) developed by the GA4GH Data Working Group, co-chaired by Haussler. Such technical capabilities, developed in conjunction with members of the BRCA Challenge's Evidence Gathering Group, will allow organizations around the globe to share their data directly with the BRCA Exchange.</p>
<p>"By aggregating genomic and clinical data from around the world, the BRCA Exchange will significantly expand clinical impact because it will allow us to bring together currently siloed datasets to facilitate classifying variants of uncertain significance and resolving those with differing interpretations," said Heidi Rehm, director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Healthcare and member of the BRCA Challenge's Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of the BRCA Exchange, which is expected to launch later this year, will offer a third tier of access, visible only to credentialed users. This controlled access space will allow for improved variant classification by aggregating and hosting case-level evidence.</p>

The 2015 camp was hosted in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a child, Katie Sweeney learned to cope with her mother's cancer at Camp Kesem, a summer program for children who have parents with the deadly disease.</p>
<p>Now the community studies major (Cowell, '16) is paying it forward. Two years ago, she founded a UC Santa Cruz chapter of the national nonprofit, which serves 5,000 children per year across 70 camps.</p>
<p>Camp Kesem's first chapter was formed in 2000 at Stanford University, where Sweeney attended from age 7 to 15. Her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when Sweeney was 7, and died four years later.</p>
<p>"I remember telling my mom when I was 9 that I wanted to start a Camp Kesem chapter, and her just telling me that I could do it," said Sweeney, now 21. "I think the first couple years I was starting up the chapter it was really hard to separate myself from being a camper too. I was wanting to recreate the same exact experience I had."</p>
<p>The camp grew quickly-attracting 24 campers its first year, and 61 the next. This summer, Sweeney expects around 80 children, ages 6 to 18 and mostly from Santa Cruz County, to attend this year's Camp Kesem, hosted in Boulder Creek. The camp is free for the children and teenagers.</p>
<p>The camp is quirky. Each camper and counselor chooses his or her own moniker, said Sweeney, who at camp goes by the name "Snickers." Children sing, paint, swim, and hike. The point is not to dwell on cancer, but to have fun, she said.</p>
<p>All 35 counselors are UC Santa Cruz students, some who've had experiences with cancer.</p>
<p>In three years, the UCSC chapter has raised around $150,000 and attracted more than 100 volunteers, including an advisory board of Santa Cruz area professionals. On May 14, the chapter will host its "Make the Magic" fundraiser dinner at the Back Nine/Inn at Pasatiempo. Tickets are available <a href="https://donate.kesem.org/santa-cruz/events/camp-kesem-at-university-california-santa-cruz-2nd-annual-make-magic/e69019">online</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney and her sister were shuffled between relatives and friends while their mother was in chemotherapy. When it became clear she was going to lose her battle, neighbors organized to leave dinners on her doorstep.</p>
<p>"I saw my mom become really weak, and I think for any kid to see their parent kind of deteriorate before their eyes, it's a really scary feeling because they're the people who are supposed to take care of them and they're not even able to take care of themselves," she said.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXlPG4k1_Ow" width="560"></iframe> 
<p>Supporting young campers through that experience has been therapeutic, Sweeney said. "One boy said that when his dad passed away, he felt like he wanted to pass away, too. He remembered screaming in his pillow and being so upset, but now when he's at Camp Kesem he can feel his dad playing alongside with him. That's really the goal," Sweeney said. "When I'm at camp I definitely feel like my mom is there, because this whole vision started with her."</p>
<p>Santa Cruz resident and ballroom instructor Zak Bauman (Merrill '94, American Literature) received treatment for breast cancer last spring before enrolling her two children for the camp. Bauman said she's grateful her children found others who could understand, and she got a week by herself to heal.</p>
<p>"My son, he came home and said, 'I'm not sure I realized how bad it could be.'," said Bauman, who is now in remission. "I think it was an eye-opener for him. They saw me come out on the other side, but that's not always the case and I think for him to see that there were kids who had lost their parents and then to see that life goes on. So, bad things happen yet we still continue to live, and what you choose to do with that is a choice."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e2c39a438072701713dacb13cd001b6a"><name>attempted-sexual-assault</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin - Attempted Sexual Assault, Sexual Battery (16-359)</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received a report of an attempted sexual assault and sexual battery that occurred in a Porter College dormitory room. </summary><start-date>1459580400000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin - Attempted Sexual Assault, Sexual Battery (16-359)</display-name><path>/2016/04/attempted-sexual-assault</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/attempted-sexual-assault</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1459798381806</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459800083775</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received a report of an attempted sexual assault and sexual battery that occurred in a Porter College dormitory room.

<div><strong>Safety Tips&#160;</strong></div>
<div>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for the crimes they commit and their effects.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.&#160;</li>
<li>Victims of crime and witnesses should report all crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, when it is safe to do so by calling 911.&#160;</li>
<li>Lock all doors and windows. Do not defeat any locking mechanisms or prop doors open. Do not allow others that you do not know "tailgate" in behind you.&#160;</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;</li>
<li>Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.&#160;</li>

Like many of you, we are both outraged and saddened by these tragic events. These actions will have a lasting impact on those arrested, their victims, and the UC Santa Cruz, and surrounding communities.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 The increase in availability and access to alcohol, heroin, methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), prescription drugs, marijuana, and other drugs is staggering. The quantities of these substances being ingested, especially in &#8220;cocktails,&#8221; coupled with increased levels of potency, are the primary factors leading to overdoses. Unfortunately, soon after our last message was sent, we learned of yet another UCSC student who died of an overdose.<br/>
 &#8232;<br/>
 As a community, we must shift the current paradigm regarding alcohol and other drugs. We must all engage in candid conversations about the inherent consequences of drug use, especially addressing harm and addiction, while taking the opportunity to reduce the &#8220;romantic&#8221; perception of drug culture. These arrests, the loss of life, and access to the large quantities of drugs, including alcohol and marijuana, should never be considered acceptable or normal on our campus.<br/>
 &#8232;<br/>
 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS<br/>
 The sales and use of prescription drugs is also a problem, as recent arrests have shown. In fact, many use and share prescription drugs without hesitation because they believe prescription drugs are &#8220;legal&#8221; because a doctor prescribes them. When students use prescription drugs that are not prescribed to them, reactions can be unpredictable, and often leads to dangerous <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/overdose-prevention/common-combinations.html">synergistic effects</a>, especially when combined with alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 CANNABINOID HYPEREMESIS SYNDROME<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz Police Department, the Student Health Center, CAPS, and SHOP have all recently come across students who were in a marijuana-induced psychosis after using highly concentrated concoctions of marijuana. Higher concentration levels of THC (the psychoactive component of marijuana) from waxing, dabbing, edibles, etc., have contributed to individuals experiencing hallucinations and disorientation.&#160; Unfortunately, some have also experienced uncontrollable vomiting and dehydration associated with &#8220;cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,&#8221; and needed immediate medical care, including hospitalization.&#160; It is extremely important to seek immediate medical attention for anyone exhibiting these symptoms by calling 911.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 NALOXONE (NARCAN) KITS<br/>
 Naloxone kits (also known as Narcan) have become widely available to help curb overdoses from opioids such as heroin, Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, morphine, codeine, and others. Naloxone kits are easily administered by anyone to temporarily &#8220;interrupt&#8221; an overdose while emergency medical services are on their way. It is critical to call 911 to get professional assistance if a naloxone kit is administered.&#160; It is important to note that naloxone kits do not guarantee that a victim will not suffer harm, injury, or death.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <a href="http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/pharmacy/services.html">Naloxone kits</a> can be obtained at the Student Health Center pharmacy on campus. Students who have UCSHIP will pay a $5 copay for naloxone kits and receive brief training on how to use the naloxone kits when they pick up their kit. Individuals interested in acquiring a naloxone kit who do not have UCSHIP are encouraged to meet with a&#160;<a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/about/index.html">SHOP staff person.</a>&#160;Even if you do not have the UCSHIP health insurance SHOP will assist you in obtaining a naloxone kit.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 The Student Health Center pharmacy&#8212;which is a confidential and safe space&#8212;also provides <a href="http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/pharmacy/disposal.html">personal sharps containers</a> for campus community members who use injectable medications. Additionally, syringes and needles are available without a prescription to any student who asks for them. <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 SIGNS OF OVERDOSE<br/>
 When community members can recognize an overdose and act quickly, lives can be saved. This is another way we can all play a part. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department, Student Health Center, and Colleges, Housing &amp; Educational Services (CHES) want all students to be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose and know how and when to get help for each other.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 An overdose can vary from person to person. However, most people experiencing an overdose present these common symptoms:<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Will NOT wake up&#8212;unconscious and unresponsive<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Vomiting while passed out<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Slow/Irregular breathing&#8212;gurgled sounding<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Pale skin<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Bluish tinge to mouth and fingernails<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#9642;&#160;&#160; &#160;Uncontrollable vomiting while conscious due to high quantities of marijuana <br/>
 &#8232;<br/>
 <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/overdose-prevention/making-the-call.html">Call 911 without hesitation if you suspect someone is experiencing alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose</a>.&#160;Even if you aren't sure or don't want any trouble, please call. You could save the life of a fellow student. <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 GETTING HELP<br/>
 If you or someone you care about needs support around overuse of alcohol and/or drugs or would like to learn more about obtaining a naloxone kit, utilize the resources provided to students through <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/">Student Health Outreach and Promotion&#160;(SHOP)</a> program in the Cowell Student Health Center. SHOP is a safe, confidential and nonjudgmental space where students can talk about alcohol and other drugs.

<p>Historically, universities have had teaching centers where faculty and graduate students could go for advice on teaching. Our CITL is part of a national change in higher education culture to focus more on aspects of learning. The reason for teaching is for students to learn. Thus it makes sense to shift our perspective to focus on learning, and to see teaching as a critical piece in facilitating learning.</p>
<p>The educational literature has much research on the concept of &#8220;backward design.&#8221; The idea is to start by defining the learning objectives for the course. What does the instructor expect students to know by the end of the course? These could be skills, such as textual analysis, laboratory technique, or voice skills in theater; or these could be facts, such as the history of social movements or the physical laws of electricity. Once the instructor has defined the learning goals, then the rest of the course is explicitly designed to teach and assess those goals. Thus the syllabus would cover the topics needed to reach those goals. Quizzes and exams would be written to focus on measuring learning related to those goals. And, the instructor would determine modes of instruction and teaching methods to help students reach those goals. The point of the course is to help students learn and to achieve those learning goals.</p>
<p>The backward design approach is in contrast to the traditional approach of first deciding what topics will be covered, then writing exams relative to those topics, and finally describing student learning in terms of a list of topics from the syllabus, rather than a coherent set of goals at the core of the course.</p>
<p>Within a framework of student learning, CITL will partner with a wide range of other campus units to provide both traditional and forward-looking teaching support. CITL will provide traditional confidential one-on-one mentoring and teaching feedback, and it will facilitate teaching assistant development, classroom cultural competency training, and assessment of student learning.</p>
<p>CITL will be a resource for faculty who want to learn about the latest best practices in teaching and about new technologies that can be incorporated into their teaching to improve student learning. It will facilitate the sound pedagogical use of technology-enhanced instruction. There are plans to bring back faculty grants for work that improves student learning.</p>

<p>The nearly $20 million Environmental Health and Safety Facility, funded by the state through the UC Office of the President, will help ensure the campus continues to comply with state and federal regulations. The 5,200-square-foot building will be built adjacent to Heller Road, just south of the Kerr Hall pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>"Fulfilling the campus mission goes beyond the classroom and laboratory, and includes the hard work of staff members who help support faculty and students at our university," said Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. "This new facility will improve our waste management from labs and reduce processing costs."</p>
<p>The project went out for a 30-day public review today, part of the California Environmental Quality Act process. Construction on the Hazardous Materials Staging Facility is expected to start in the second half of 2017 and end in December 2018. As with all campus buildings, architects have designed the facility to blend in with and minimally disrupt the natural landscape.</p>
<p>Currently, lab waste is directed to two different interim facilities, one on Science Hill and one at the base of campus. This project will consolidate the management into one site. Patrick Goff, executive director of Environmental Health &amp; Safety and the Office of Emergency Services, said all other UC campuses, except Merced, have built similar facilities.</p>
<p>"This facility is an investment in the important research conducted every day at UC Santa Cruz," Goff said. "The building will reduce the risk that comes with transporting hazardous material to different sites on campus, as well as increase our efficiency and reduce costs."</p>
<p>The facility will be used to manage chemical waste and low-level radioactive waste.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has instructors and researchers in the life sciences, physical sciences and fine arts, who use chemicals in their work and generate waste that needs processing and disposal. In addition, chemicals are used to help maintain the campus. Chemical waste is packaged and labeled by trained researchers and staff, and is collected once a week to bring it to the holding facility. Within 90 days, a licensed contractor transports the chemical waste to an approved and permitted treatment, storage and disposal facility.</p>
<p>Additionally, some researchers in the life sciences and physical sciences use low-level radioactive materials to carry out experiments and educate students on certain techniques. The campus annually receives less than 100 milliliters&#8212;or less than 3 ounces&#8212;of radioactive material for research.</p>
<p>Natural radiation is all around us. For example, living in Santa Cruz exposes a person to about 647 millirem of radiation every year. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, can expose a person to much more. A pack a day adds up to about 25,000 millirem in a year.</p>
<p>UCSC's radiation workers, including researchers and staff handling radioactive waste, typically receive doses below 10 mrem per year from their work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

in preparation for the university's popular Business Design Showcase, a competition to be held Tuesday, April 12 in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>About 16 teams are expected to participate in the annual event that draws together some of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs. Each team will have up to six minutes to pitch a business idea to a panel of seven judges, each seasoned businessmen and women. From there, they will proceed to woo a larger crowd of invited industry guests and members of the public for a coveted People's Choice Award.</p>
<p>"We have everything from underarm deodorant to virtual reality workspaces and GoPro camera stabilizers," said Sue Carter, executive director of the UC Santa Cruz Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development.</p>
<p>CIED plays an active role in developing student entrepreneurship through events, mentorship, community and industry partnerships and teaching innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It is the fourth showcase organized by CIED and, due to its growing popularity, the first to limit contestants to teams that have either won previous competitions, such as the open UCSC Pitch Slam! in December or the Hack UCSC 2016 in January, or been referred by instructors of entrepreneurship or a CIED staff member.</p>
<p>"It's just a really great mix of low tech and high tech companies developed by grad students and undergrads," said Sonya Newlyn, special program assistant at CIED. "It's going to be really hard to choose winners. I would hate to be a judge."</p>
<p>Code Naturally, a student company that is developing educational software to help teach young students to code, is one success story from last year's showcase.</p>
<p>"It could have totally been just an idea, but thanks to the framework and all that CIED provides, we have these resources and it's developing into a full company," said senior Sukh Singh, who is now CEO of the company he cofounded with students Asher Gardner and Justin Blair.</p>
<p>In the last year, Singh and a growing team have continued to take advantage of support from CIED, including several critical introductions into the community that have included free tickets to the monthly Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp where they picked up a board advisor and an introduction to mentor Jim Brisimitzis, general manager for the Microsoft Start-up program. Brisimitzis has provided the startup with ongoing support and orchestrated the free use of Surface tablets to beta test the software in a local school. Code Naturally, which is based in the backyard Santa Cruz patio of its cofounders, is now raising its second round of seed funding.</p>
<p>"CIED has showed me it's possible to do these kinds of things," Singh said. "Having that support from them helped us push on through those moments of doubt."<br/>
 This Silicon Valley venue reflects UCSC's strong ties with the entrepreneurship community. The list of judges and guests includes venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, CEOs, patent attorneys and UCSC faculty entrepreneurs, as well as other VIPs in the startup community. A full list of the judges, competing businesses and event sponsors can be found at the <a href="http://cied.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/business-design-showcase.html">CIED site</a>.</p>
<p>Naeem Zafar, a serial entrepreneur, author and faculty member at the Center of Entrepreneurship and Technology at UC Berkeley, is the keynote speaker. He is CEO and co-founder of TeleSense, an Internet-based environmental monitoring tech startup. Previously he founded Bitzer Mobile, an enterprise security and mobility company that was acquired by Oracle in 2013.</p>
<p>"We're really excited to have someone with such a strong reputation for teaching student innovators and who is also a successful entrepreneur and VC," Carter said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal will also speak at the event.</p>
<p>The first place prize earns $4,000, second place, $3,000, and third place, $2,000. About 70 guests will then have an opportunity to visit with the student teams during the showcase portion of the event, enjoying refreshments while casting their allotted Slug Bucks in a vote for the coveted People's Choice Award and $1,000.</p>
<p>The showcase is just one in a series of CIED-sponsored opportunities aimed at student entrepreneurs, each meant to push students to develop their ideas and partnerships, secure funding and incorporate. Other upcoming events include the University of California Carbon Slam and the 10-week summer Entrepreneurship Academy.</p>
<p>"CIED is working really hard for our undergraduate and graduate students to be innovators," Carter said.</p>
<p>Co-sponsors of the event include UCSC Foundation Trustee and venture capitalist Kamil H. Hasan and his wife, Talat Hasan; TiE SV, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship in Sunnyvale; and Business With Pleasure, a graphic design, print and shipping company in Scotts Valley. From the campus, UCSC division sponsors include: Division of Graduate of Studies, Baskin School of Engineering, Office of Research and University Relations.</p>

Michael Nayak the $3,000 grand prize as winner of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s second annual Grad Slam competition Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>The third year Ph.D. candidate in Earth and planetary sciences stood in a circle of light on the Music Recital Hall stage to describe his research, which not only showed that moons can exist in a system where the gravities of five close-by planets constantly fight for dominance but is also giving clues about what those moons might look like.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled,&#8221; said Nayak of the win.</p>
<p>Nayak, who lives in San Francisco and also works for NASA-Ames, grinned and said he plans to use his winnings to pay off a parking ticket &#8220;and then, we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>His win means Nayak will go on to represent UC Santa Cruz at the UC-wide Grad Slam finals April 22 at LinkedIn headquarters in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Joseph Stewart, a third-year candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology, leaped onto the stage to collect $1,500 and a second-place win for his talk on the effects of rapid climate change on wildlife and plants while Damla Ozcelik of Turkey, a sixth year Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering, nabbed the People&#8217;s Choice award and $750 for her presentation on optofluidics, which can be used to inexpensively and quickly detect viruses in human blood.</p>
<p>Ten finalists competed in the fast-paced event and were scored by a diverse panel of judges. Participants were allowed one Power Point slide, barred from costumes or song, and marked on clarity, delivery, intellectual significance, and audience engagement.</p>
<p>Born from a research communication competition first held at the University of Queensland in Australia, Grad Slams are designed not only to showcase the work being done by graduate students but also to highlight the need to be able to explain research to the wider world. Some 170 universities in 17 countries now hold these types of events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grad Slam is a fun, informative event celebrating the wonderful research our graduate students conduct at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Tyrus Miller, the campus&#8217;s dean of graduate studies. &#8220;But there is also a serious message underscored by the event; the positive impact of research depends not only on its scholarly quality, but also on its clear, compelling communication to a broad audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>An enthusiastic crowd greeted each of the participants, who stood alone in front of a single microphone in what might be described as the academic version of speed dating.</p>
<p>Sarah Beganskas, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Earth sciences, described her work on storm runoff, which is often treated as a nuisance to be re-routed from streets into rivers and seas, but that its capture and return to groundwater could be an important part of a sustainable resource.</p>
<p>Andrew Marsh took the stage in a T-shirt advertising a space-based x-ray telescope called NuStar whose data he is using to explore something called the Coronal Heating Problem, which has baffled scientists for 70 years.</p>
<p>The mystery is why the sun&#8217;s surface registers a temperature of about 5,000 degrees while the sun&#8217;s corona is 2 million degrees, said Marsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as if the sun was a campfire and the farther you walked away from it the hotter it got,&#8221; said Marsh, who is studying nanoflares as a possible explanation for the phenomenon.</p>
<p>From exploring the tactics of cigarette companies to keep warning labels off its products around the globe to a look at how diversity in dialogue can boost problem solving, the finalists took an enthusiastic audience on a highlight tour of research being done at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was brilliant,&#8221; said audience member Niamh Maher (Crown &#8217;17, physics). &#8220;It was great to hear the different research being done here, from astrophysics to psychology."</p>
<p>Judges included Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research and professor of computer science at UC Santa Cruz; Bruce Daniels, president of the Soquel Creek Water District; Ted Holladay, vice president and creative director at Hirshorn Zuckerman Design Group (HZDG) in Santa Cruz; Bonnie Primbsch, interim general manager of KUSP radio; Lynda Rogers, dean of UC Santa Cruz Extension; Bill Tysseling, president and CEO of the Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce; and David Watson, owner of The Literary Guillotine and the founder of New Pacific Press.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3079fa88072701713dacb131ca2b214"><name>reich-visit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reich delivers stinging indictment of 'crony' capitalism</title><summary>Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich discussed the problems of contemporary capitalism and politics before a full house at the Rio Theatre Tuesday (April 5), an event hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Blum Center for Poverty, Social Enterprise and Participatory Governance.</summary><start-date>1460070900000</start-date><display-name>Robert Reich visit</display-name><path>/2016/04/reich-visit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/reich-visit</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1460071275073</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1460088245852</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/reich_bullock-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/reich_bullock-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reich_bullock-500.jpg</name><display-name>reich_bullock-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>141747</file-size><width>500</width><height>303</height></image><image-alt>robert reich</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/reich-robert-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/reich-robert-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reich-robert-80.jpg</name><display-name>reich-robert-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14847</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>robert reich</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor and now a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley, in conversation with Heather Bullock.

<p>In a lively conversation with Heather Bullock, a UCSC psychology professor and incoming director of the Blum Center, Reich questioned the role government really plays when big business mixes with politics.</p>
<p>Reich shared his thoughts on topics ranging from campaign finance reform to income inequality, a shrinking middle class, raising the minimum wage, and the student loan crisis. An ardent Bernie Sanders supporter, Reich served as labor secretary to President Bill Clinton from 1993-1997, and said he&#8217;s known Hillary Clinton since she was 19. He even revealed he once dated Mrs. Clinton when she was a Wellesley student.</p>
<p>Reich&#8217;s latest book, <em>Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</em> (Knopf, 2015) formed the basis of the discussion. In his book, Reich discusses the increased concentration of political and economic influence of corporate and financial executives. He argues that, by and large, the economy and government is controlled by large corporations, Wall Street, and select individuals&#8211;the 1 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political power shapes laws to protect proprietaries,&#8221; Reich said. Extensive lobbying by corporations with financial interest has resulted in governments working for businesses not people, he said.</p>
<p>The result? Wealth is redistributed upwards from the lower and middle classes to the top. The middle class flattens as financial access is widened for the wealthy.</p>
<p>Reich urged the friendly and supportive audience to &#8220;get out of our bubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argued that learning occurs from having conversations with people of different perspectives. Learning is about disagreeing with someone, he said, and advocated for more bipartisan dialogue not just in local communities but on Capitol Hill as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nation needs two responsible parties (maybe three) to govern,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For his book tour to promote <em>Saving Capitalism</em>, Reich said he asked his publisher to send him to conservative states in part so he could listen to residents to understand both sides of the same problem: &#8220;crony&#8221; or &#8220;rigged&#8221; capitalism made visible during bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009. &#160;</p>
<p>He argued that two popular movements from opposite sides of the political spectrum, Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party, emerged out of the financial crisis. They share the same lineage, he said, and have led to the presidential candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Reich is now a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley. He is also a trustee and senior fellow for the Blum Center for Developing Economies, a network of interdisciplinary hubs at UC campuses focused on understanding global poverty and inequality. &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f333dd488072701713dacb138449a349"><name>danm-mfa-exhibition</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Digital Arts &amp; New Media graduate exhibition to focus on the blind spot </title><summary>Thirteen graduate students from the Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A.

Program (DANM) at UC Santa Cruz will conclude two years of artistic study with <a href="http://danmmfa.ucsc.edu/2016spotlights/"><em><strong>Blind Spot</strong></em></a>&#8212;an exhibition running on campus April 28 through May 1 at the Digital Arts Research Center. <br/>
 <br/>
 The artists will share their work to illustrate the way new media and digital art is created through repurposed technology, performance, playable media, electronic sculpture, and collaborative research. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The title of the exhibition refers directly to the <em>punctum caecum</em> or blind spot,&#8221; said DANM lecturer and show curator Dorothy Santos. &#8220;It is the area of the eye where photoreceptors do not exist, hence the inability to render or detect an image. In order to see what is in our blind spot, we must shift and alternate our positioning or gaze.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;But it certainly does not mean that what we cannot see does not exist,&#8221; she added. &#8220;In a metaphorical sense, these artists create in such a space that requires the viewer to move and shift for the work to be seen and experienced.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 A number of the students&#8217; projects approach game design in unorthodox and provocative ways. <br/>
 <br/>
 Adrian Phillips&#8217;s "No Frontier" addresses notions of frontier fantasies through a digital game for two players in which one player takes the role of a native population, while the other takes the role of a newly-arrived foreigner. <br/>
 <br/>
 While in Michael Thom&#233;t&#8217;s &#8220;Dirt Under the Rug,&#8221;the player is confronted with alternative experiences and narratives based on Thom&#233;t&#8217;s research of player psychology and playing styles.<br/>
 <br/>
 Nick Andrade and Hope Hutman shift the defining features commonly known to traditional theater into experimental performances. Andrade explores Narco culture through an interpretation of Shakespeare&#8217;s Macbeth, while Hutman&#8217;s project challenges the limits of theater and improvisation through the environment of the social media-based platform Twitch.tv.<br/>
 <br/>
 Steven Trimmer&#8217;s "Vocal Landscaping" is a voice interactive sound installation based on his research of modal vocalization. The participant&#8217;s musical voice is used to navigate landscapes and unlock sound puzzles, with each voice ultimately becoming a part of a larger vocal catalogue.<br/>
 <br/>
 Zach Corse&#8217;s "Encodings in Space and Time" is an immersive large-scale installation influenced by physics, information theory, and the course of Japanese glass fishing floats known to cross the North Pacific gyre. <br/>
 <br/>
 And David Harris&#8217;s work looks at alternative perceptions of color in the contemporary world and our limited field of vision by exploring such topics as unprintable color.<br/>
 <br/>
 On a completely different note, Sean Pace&#8217;s "C.R.A.W.L.E.R." (Community Roving Artists Workshop Lab for Educational Research) serves as a mobile platform for arts outreach, social justice, and field research&#8212;showcasing new technology people may have heard about, but might not have access to. <br/>
 <br/>
 In addition to the exhibition, the students will give artist talks about their projects, engage in a panel discussion, and take questions at a symposium on April 22 at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, beginning at 7:30 p.m.<br/>
 <br/>
 The symposium will be repeated on campus at the Digital Art Research Center on April 30 at 1:30 p.m., followed later by the opening reception for the exhibition from 5 to 9 p.m. <br/>
 <br/>
 Admission is free and open to the public for all events. <br/>

The 2016 program will feature more live music, evening astronomy lectures from world-renowned astronomers, and opportunities for the public to view celestial objects through two historic telescopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a surge in program popularity in the last few years,&#8221; said Elinor Gates, a staff astronomer based at Lick Observatory. &#8220;People are excited about the opportunity to experience the observatory at night and get a glimpse of the cosmos the way astronomers get to see them. The drive to Mt. Hamilton is well worth it for visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Music of the Spheres</strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; concert series gives the public a rare glimpse of the observatory at night, and all proceeds from the event benefit Lick Observatory. Due to program popularity, another concert was added to the lineup this year.</p>
<p>Each event features a musical performance, an astronomy lecture by a scientist, and a history presentation about Lick Observatory&#8217;s rich past. Afterward, guests take turns viewing celestial objects through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Guests have additional opportunities to stargaze with small ground telescopes provided by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; concerts take place June 11 (White Album Ensemble; speaker Natalie Batalha, NASA Ames), June 25 (Dave Rocha Jazz Trio; speaker Aaron Barth, UC Irvine), July 9 (Chaskinakuy; speaker Martin Gaskell, UCSC), July 30 (Black Cedar Trio; speaker Brad Holden, UC Observatories), August 13 (Great Guitars! Daniel Roest and Richard Gilewitz; speaker Shelley Wright, UC San Diego) and August 27 (Golden Bough; speaker Michael Gregg, UC Davis). General, preferred, and VIP tickets will be available. For additional details and ticket information, visit <a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/"><strong>ucolick.org/summer</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Evenings with the Stars</strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;Evenings with the Stars&#8221; program also gives the public a chance to view through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Similar to the &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; events, each program features an astronomy lecture by a &#8220;star&#8221; scientist and a history presentation. Amateur astronomers also set up ground telescopes so that guests can get additional telescope time.</p>
<p>Dates for the Summer Visitors Program are June 10 (speaker Mark Ammons, Lawrence Livermore National Lab), June 24 (speaker Tesla Jeltema, UCSC), July 8 (speaker Raja Guthathakurta, UCSC), July 29 (speaker Connie Rockosi, UC Observatories), August 12 (speaker Quinn Konopacky, UCSD), August 26 (speaker Andreas Burkert, University of Munich).</p>
<p>Tickets for both&#160;&#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; and &#8220;Evenings with the Stars&#8221; will go on sale to the general public at noon on Friday, April 15, at <a href="http://ucsctickets.universitytickets.com/user_pages/event_listings.asp"><strong>ucsctickets.com</strong></a>. Members of Friends of Lick Observatory (FoLO) can purchase tickets starting at noon on Friday, April 8.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Mt. Hamilton</strong></p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mt. Hamilton Road (Route 130). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the <a href="http://ucolick.org/home/index.html">UC Observatories</a> (UCO), a multicampus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz that serves eight UC campuses.</p>
<p>Additional information is available at <a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/"><strong>ucolick.org/summer</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please note: Weather may restrict telescope viewings, but other activities will still take place.

These most recent outages follow other power interruptions that have impacted our campus. This is tremendously disruptive to teaching, research, studying and overall campus operations. Outages have a negative impact on all of our ability to support the mission of our campus, as utility stability is crucial to a major research university.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer, UC Santa Cruz finished work on a new cogeneration plant. This was one of many utility projects completed over the last few years as part of our "Next Generation 2020 Electrical Master Plan," which was developed in 2008. The goals of the plan and the included projects are reliability, sustainability, and capacity.<br/>
<br/>
During normal operations, the cogen allows us to reduce our reliance on PG&amp;E's power and produces heat that can be used by the campus core buildings. During PG&amp;E outages, it is able to provide power to key campus facilities. However, in the midst of the new cogeneration plant's installation, PG&amp;E put in place operational requirements that did not allow us to use the facility in the original way designed, which was to have a seamless power transition for key campus areas.<br/>
<br/>
To address this gap, Physical Planning and Construction is now in the midst of a cogen optimization project that will provide uninterrupted power to buildings on Science Hill, even when PG&amp;E's service cuts out. We are expecting this project to be complete by fall 2017.<br/>
<br/>
The cogen is staffed 24 hours a day. Currently, the loss of PG&amp;E power causes our plant to go offline, requiring staff in Physical Plant to turn it back on. This is a process that under the best circumstances takes about a half hour and can take longer depending on when an outage occurs.<br/>
<br/>
The campus conducted a planned outage last month that was an important step toward fine-tuning the cogeneration plant settings so that we can maintain power to key facilities. We approached this testing project cautiously, expecting that the campus power disruption would be more significant than users ended up experiencing. Information gained from these tests will inform the engineers in their plans for scheduled June work and the overall optimization project.<br/>
<br/>
Physical Plant and Physical Planning and Construction have another planned testing outage tentatively scheduled for June 15. More information will be shared as we approach that date. In addition, an upcoming Tuesday Newsday article will highlight the various utility stability projects that have been completed and are underway.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your patience as we work toward completing this important project.<br/>

<p>A 1974 graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a degree in literature, McEvoy is now the CEO of Chronicle Books in San Francisco, where he is a major supporter of the arts and a trustee at SFMOMA. The donation was made in honor of his late mother, Nan Tucker McEvoy, former board chair and a principal owner of the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>.</p>
<p>He is also president of McEvoy Ranch and chairman of the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#8217;s Board of Commissioners. McEvoy&#8217;s great grandfather, M. H. de Young, was a co-founder of the Chronicle, and the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco was named in his honor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted to see that the Institute of the Arts and Sciences is already achieving national recognition for its exhibitions and other activities, and having an impact on campus too,&#8221; said McEvoy. &#8220;The mix of arts and other disciplines reflects UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s long tradition of breaking down boundaries and thinking about the big picture, whether through the arts, humanities, science, or technology. And one more thing, Go Slugs!&#8221;</p>
<p>McEvoy previously played a key role in establishing the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz, and his new gift to the campus follows an earlier donation of $250,000 which provided seed money to the Institute of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nion has been a great supporter of UC Santa Cruz, and this donation truly moves the Institute of Arts and Sciences to a new level by allowing it to develop and expand its exhibitions, events, and residency programs, &#8221; said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Dean of the Arts Bill Ladusaw added, &#8220;This gift ensures that the Institute&#8217;s program will continue to grow, engage our campus and the public, and advance our goal of attracting funding for a new facility to house IAS programs. It&#8217;s a great step forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Launched in 2013</strong> with the arrival of founding director John Weber and the start of planning for a new facility, the Institute of Arts and Sciences began developing an innovative public program in 2014. It is currently hosting interdisciplinary artist residencies, presenting public events, co-sponsoring academic conferences, and collaborating with Lick Observatory and the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art on a future exhibition.</p>
<p>Weber noted that McEvoy&#8217;s new donation to the campus will be transformational.</p>
<p>&#8220;It provides a base of funding for a national-caliber program, and the benefits to our students and the community will be huge,&#8221; said Weber.&#160; &#8220;We can commit to new projects, initiate long-term collaborations on and off campus, and raise the ante across the board in our programming.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re already getting traction with the programs we are doing, and Nion&#8217;s support means we can deepen our campus impact and extend our external visibility dramatically,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;It&#8217;s the right gift, at the right time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Programs now in progress</strong> include, <em>Collective Museum</em>, a campus-wide exhibition created by the Portland artist group, Public Doors and Windows, created over the course of a two-year residence with the IAS. This project frames the entire UC Santa Cruz campus as an immense museum, complete with 50 historic, cultural, and natural sites across campus identified by faculty, staff, alumni, and students.</p>
<p>A second residency is also underway with renowned artist Russell Crotty, who has done research at Lick Observatory and consulted with UC Santa Cruz astronomers and astrophysicists about their work. Crotty&#8217;s new astronomy-based artwork will be exhibited next fall at the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), along with archival objects from Lick Observatory. Curated in collaboration with the ICA by Weber, Crotty, and Tony Misch, director of the Lick Collections, the project recently was awarded a prestigious Andy Warhol Foundation grant.&#160;</p>
<p>Future exhibition plans include the <em>Crochet Coral Reef</em>, a project by Margaret and Christine Wertheim of Los Angeles.&#160; Since 2005, the sisters have been teaching people around the world to crochet coral forms and learn about how global warming and the acidification of the oceans have compromised these key contributors to marine ecology.&#160; This project will include campus-wide student participation leading up to shows on campus at the Sesnon Gallery and at the university&#8217;s Seymour Marine Discovery Center in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gift demonstrates confidence in our long-term vision,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz professor Jennifer Gonzalez, one of the original champions of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, who is featured in a new video about the project now featured on the institute&#8217;s <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/about"><strong><em>web site</em></strong></a>.&#160; &#8220;It will offer opportunities for our faculty and students to collaborate on innovative, socially relevant projects with the increased resources of the institute,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Students, faculty, and staff of UC Santa Cruz now have access to <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/resources/welltrack.html">WellTrack</a>, an online resource for stress, anxiety, and depression reduction. WellTrack is a secure and anonymous way for users to assess their personal well-being and quickly gain access to resources tailored to meet their individual needs. Students and staff will be able to engage with self-guided tools designed to help them adjust their thoughts and behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 WellTrack is available online at <a href="http://mywelltrack.com">mywelltrack.com</a>; access has been paid for by CAPS. Access cards, posters, and other marketing materials will be placed across campus with the access code provided. MoodCheck, the companion mobile app to WellTrack, provides users with a quick and easy way to check in their mood while on the go.&#160; MoodCheck is available for free from the Apple App Store and from Google Play for Android.<br/>
<br/>
 WellTrack originates from the work of Darren Piercey, a psychology professor at the University of New Brunswick. Piercey&#8217;s laboratory research investigated Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) for depression, stress, and anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
 CAPS primarily serves UC Santa Cruz students and, in support of student well-being, provides consultation services for faculty and staff. The purchase of a limited-time campus-wide license for WellTrack comes with access not only for students, but for faculty and staff as well.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The more familiar we are with the resources available to our campus community, the easier it will be to introduce students to the resources," said Dorje Jennette, CAPS clinical director. "Everyone in the campus community is encouraged to check out WellTrack while we pilot their service.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Gary Dunn, CAPS Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://caps.ucsc.edu/resources/welltrack.html</url><title>More information on WellTrack</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="077c97918072701713dacb13939328dd"><name>career-tracks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Career Tracks being implemented at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Campus implementation of Career Tracks, part of a UC systemwide effort, will transition non-represented employees into new Career Tracks job titles. </summary><start-date>1460414400000</start-date><display-name>Career Tracks</display-name><path>/2016/04/career-tracks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/career-tracks</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1460414485056</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1460417240262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write with an update on our campus implementation of Career Tracks. As a reminder, this is part of a UC systemwide effort. This project will transition non-represented employees into new Career Tracks job titles. The Career Tracks job structure has four goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a system-wide series of job classifications/titles that reflect primary job responsibilities and UC systemwide norms&#160;</li>
<li>Provide employees with better-defined career paths&#160;</li>
<li>Align future pay practices with the local labor market&#160;</li>
<li>Provide more transparent classification decisions and enhance reporting and analytic capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Career Tracks is not a salary or compensation program, and therefore is not intended to affect employee pay when it is implemented at UCSC. The new classification system will provide a better foundation for making future salary decisions. It will also help align unit objectives with organizational structure as well as resource and budget allocations going forward.</p>
<p>Implementation of Career Tracks at all UC locations is a high priority of President Janet Napolitano. It has already been implemented at several campuses, as well as at the Office of the President. Implementation is underway at all remaining locations.</p>
<p>UCSC conducted a Career Tracks pilot for information technology jobs in 2015. There were many lessons learned from that pilot, and we will apply those lessons as we get set to implement Career Tracks for the rest of campus. All affected employees will move into new payroll titles and classifications at one time. The current project scope applies to Managers and Senior Professionals (MSP) and Professional and Support Staff (PSS) jobs only. Senior Management Group (SMG), academics, and represented employees will not be affected.</p>
<p>Our campus implementation is being managed by Staff Human Resources with support from the UCOP project team. Elvia Moreno is the UCSC project manager. The project timeline and milestones have been developed with a goal of having all eligible employees converted by February 2017./p&gt;</p>
<p>We are enthusiastic about implementing Career Tracks.

As a result, the district is looking at cuts across its service area of Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Metro officials have stated that several factors have lead to the current financial challenges, including increased personnel costs, decreased tax revenues, and flat ridership.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Public transportation is a critical service that supports access for our campus community, with thousands of faculty, staff and students taking Metro daily. No doubt, news of service cuts is cause for great concern.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>During 2014-2015, weekday school-term student ridership averaged 11,080 rides per day. Faculty and staff ridership during the same timeframe averaged 557 rides per day. UCSC affiliates account for 50 percent of all Metro ridership in Santa Cruz County and approaches 60 percent during school-term months. Approximately 50 percent of all Metro ridership occurs on the seven routes directly serving the UCSC main campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Metro&#8217;s initial proposal of service cuts can be found at:</span></p>

<p><span>UCSC leadership has been actively engaged in providing feedback to Metro about the proposed cuts and their impact on our campus. Our Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) team has provided the board with numerous analyses outlining the impact and suggesting alternatives. UC Santa Cruz holds an ex-officio seat on the board. Public hearings on the revised proposal will take place throughout May. A final service reduction plan will be adopted at the end of June and will be implemented in September.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b2c25228072701713dacb135c1ac57f"><name>sexual-harrassment-violence</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sexual harassment and sexual violence at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>There is no place within our campus community for those who commit acts of sexual violence or sexual harassment.</summary><start-date>1460012400000</start-date><display-name>Sexual harassment and sexual violence at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2016/04/sexual-harrassment-violence</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/sexual-harrassment-violence</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1460476321789</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1460476321789</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In light of recent attention on sexual assault and sexual harassment nationally, I want to be clear about my own expectations: There is no place within our campus community for those who commit acts of sexual violence or sexual harassment.</p>
<p>As you <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html">read last week</a>, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway is convening a town hall May 10 to foster dialogue among students, staff, and faculty. She has also issued a forceful call for all faculty to go beyond compliance&#8212;the absence of bad conduct&#8212;to make a positive contribution to each student and colleague. I strongly support both efforts.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment encompasses sexual violence, defined as sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Public awareness and understanding are growing, making it easier for people to come forward.</p>
<p>Tracey Tsugawa, our Title IX officer, is seeing a dramatic increase in reports of all forms of sexual harassment. Last year, her office received 181 reports; that's up from 85 reports the previous year. Already this year, the office has received 162 reports. I am heartened that victim/survivors are accessing resources and getting the support they need.</p>
<p>The campus remains committed to increasing awareness. April is national Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and you'll see posters promoting the second phase of our awareness campaign, "My Body, My Rules: Ask First."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also part of a systemwide effort led by UC President Janet Napolitano; she convened a <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ethics-compliance-audit-services/compliance/SVSA.html">UC task force</a> on sexual violence and sexual assault in July 2014. As part of that, I am serving on a joint committee of UC representatives that reviewed our disciplinary procedures for faculty; our recommendations will go to President Napolitano shortly.</p>
<p>Being sexually harassed is a profound violation that can have devastating immediate&#8212;and potentially life-long&#8212;consequences.</p>
<p>On our campus, the majority of reports involving sexual harassment and sexual violence involve student-on-student interactions, and I want to be clear that I expect faculty to take appropriate steps to protect the safety and wellbeing of anyone they believe may have been mistreated. That includes sharing what they know with our <a href="http://hdpiu.ucsc.edu">Title IX Office</a>, which oversees all sex discrimination on campus, including sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>
<p>Some faculty and students have objected to a new UC policy that took effect in January, requiring professors to notify the Title IX Office if students indicate they have experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence. This policy has been in place on our campus since 1993. Although I understand faculty concerns, I support this policy.</p>
<p>Twice in my career I have had students initiate conversations about being the target of sexual harassment. Each time I explained at the outset that I was obligated to report anything I heard that seemed to meet the threshold of sexual harassment and asked if they wanted to continue. Both times, the students chose to continue the conversation; both times I offered counsel and shared the information with our Title IX officer, who reached out to the students.</p>
<p>The policy requiring professors to notify the Title IX Office helps ensure that students in crisis can access the full scope of help that is available, including academic accommodations, confidential counseling, housing changes, issuance of no-contact directives, and off-campus resources. This policy also helps our Title IX staff identify potential serial perpetrators.</p>
<p>I want UC Santa Cruz to model the way forward&#8212;in prevention, response, and in fundamentally changing our culture to rid the campus of these behaviors. Please join this critical campus conversation, speak up, and take action. We must make individual and collective commitments to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b6342ab8072701713dacb13d8e1fb88"><name>student-volunteer-recognition-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations needed for Student Volunteer Center's annual service recognition awards</title><summary>The Student Volunteer Center is hosting its annual Service Recognition Ceremony.

The Student Volunteer Center is hosting its annual Service Recognition Ceremony. We want to honor anyone who has had exemplary service work, on or off campus, during their time at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
 <br/>
 Nominate a student, faculty or staff member, student organization, or even yourself at <a href="http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/programs/src.html">http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/programs/src.html</a>. There are five categories: silver service award, gold service award, platinum service award, student organization/Greek award, faculty/staff award. We will honoring those nominated with a special dinner and reflection back on all of their hard work. Deadline for nominations is Friday, May 6, 2016 by 5 p.m.&#160; Direct questions to <a href="mailto:volunteer@ucsc.edu">volunteer@ucsc.edu</a> or 831-459-3363.<br/>
 <br/>
 Silver, gold, and platinum awards are for individual students who have completed exemplary unpaid volunteer or internship work. Each award is based on quarters served. For instance, if someone has completed eight quarters of service work for an organization, they can be nominated for the platinum award.<br/>
 <br/>
 The student organization/Greek award is to celebrate a group of students that goes beyond the call of duty. For instance, if there is a Greek org that has done more philanthropy work than is necessary or has done their philanthropy work with great dedication, they can be nominated.<br/>
 <br/>
 For staff, we are looking for staff members who go beyond their work duties to offer their services and time to others. Preferably, we look for staff members who do this extra work without pay, but feel free to still nominate someone if you feel that they are deserving.<br/>
 <br/>
 Nominations may be made at&#160;<a href="http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/programs/src.html">http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/programs/src.html</a> through a google form. Please make all nominations by 5 p.m. Friday, May 6.<br/>
 <br/>
 Each nominated person will be reviewed; if they meet the qualifications, they will receive an invitation to the Service Recognition Ceremony. The ceremony will consist of a dinner and award presentation. For the award presentation, we will use what each nominator writes about the person to highlight their achievements. Each nominated person, staff, and students, will be allowed to choose a gift card donated from local Santa Cruz businesses. Everyone will be given a certificate for their achievements. Nominators will also be invited to partake in the festivities.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Dean of Students on behalf of the Student Volunteer Center</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b6ed7aa8072701713dacb13eb012693"><name>saam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student-organized events highlight Sexual Assault Awareness Month</title><summary>Four weeks of events and activities are scheduled this month to raise awareness and support survivors of sexual violence as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM).</summary><start-date>1460480400000</start-date><display-name>Sexual Assault Awareness Month</display-name><path>/2016/04/saam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/saam</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1460480692881</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1460487838785</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/calendar3.7-550.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/calendar3.7-550.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>calendar3.7-550.jpg</name><display-name>calendar3.7-550.jpg</display-name><file-size>177495</file-size><width>550</width><height>356</height></image><image-alt>sexual assault awareness month calendar</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/calendar3.7-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/calendar3.7-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>calendar3.7-80.jpg</name><display-name>calendar3.7-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>32466</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>care logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Four weeks of events and activities are scheduled this month to raise awareness and support survivors of sexual violence as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM).</p>
<p>The events at UC Santa Cruz and in the Santa Cruz community are part of a nationwide effort to build awareness of sexual assault, dating violence and gender-based violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting support from the community and other students is the main objective of SAAM,&#8221; said Carly Taylor, a third-year student who is outreach coordinator for the campus CARE office. &#8220;Prevention requires the whole community to be really intentional.&#8221;</p>
<p>CARE (Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education) is the primary point of contact for survivors who experience any form of sexual violence in the UC Santa Cruz community. CARE director Emily Crutcher and her colleagues provide confidential advocacy and resources. She emphasized that SAAM is a student-led effort.</p>
<p>Taylor said students got together and &#8220;decided all of the different objectives of what we want people to know about.&#8221; Student volunteers in the CARE office&#8217;s growing volunteer program then put the program together.</p>
<p>Planning began with general themes for each week, and organizers collaborated with other groups across campus. Themes include gender and masculinity, resources on campus, and healing and alternative therapies.</p>
<p>Among the events is a workshop on &#8220;Violence in Queer Communities&#8221; in collaboration with the Cantu Queer Center, Thursday, April 14, from 6-8 p.m. in Namaste Lounge.</p>
<p>Take Back the Night is planned for Thursday, April 21, at 5:30 p.m. in partnership with the Women's Center with a rally at Quarry Plaza, march, and speak-out. The Women's Center describes the event as a time for survivors and allies to speak out on ending sexual violence in a rally and march through campus, culminating in an opportunity for survivors and allies to have their voices heard in a safe space. Keynote speaker will be Mia Mingus, a writer, public speaker, community educator and organizer.</p>
<p>Wrapping up the month, is a variety of alternative healing and self-care workshops including Healing Yoga, Wednesday, April 27, 7:00-8:30 p.m. at the East Field House. It will be a free trauma-informed yoga class open to all UCSC students, staff, and faculty.

<p>It kept her away from the drugs and alcohol that surrounded her teenage years. It dulled the ache of a family that was split apart. It gave her confidence as she slammed the ball into the outfield, a power hitter who also played aggressive defense.</p>
<p>So when, as a freshman, she went to the annual Fall Festival put on by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports and discovered there was no fast-pitch softball team, she felt unmoored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember thinking, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be here,&#8217;&#8221; said Esparza (College Eight &#8217;18, psychology).</p>
<p>To understand what Esparza did next requires a little background.</p>
<p>At age 7, Esparza left a turbulent home life to live with her &#8220;Nana,&#8221; a quiet woman who introduced her granddaughter to softball, the sport Esparza came to love.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not the fastest one on the team,&#8221; Esparza said. &#8220;I was the chubby girl but I was a big hitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Esparza&#8217;s grandmother drove her young charge to practice and tournaments, pushed her to do well in school, and even ferried her to friends&#8217; events.</p>
<p>&#8220;She loved me more than anyone,&#8221; Esparza said.</p>
<p>By age 13, Esparza was playing travel ball and later was named captain of her junior varsity team at West Torrance High School, winning an award for the best offensive player. She became known as someone who could make big plays and bat cleanup.</p>
<p>Intent on going to college, Esparza got an offer to play for Utah University but, because there was no scholarship, she turned instead to UC Santa Cruz where the psychology department&#8217;s reputation drew her in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up, I went through a lot of hardship with my family. I&#8217;ve been through a lot,&#8221; said Esparza, who hopes to become a clinical psychologist. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to have someone be there for you and I didn&#8217;t have anyone to talk to. I would like to be there for people who can&#8217;t cope.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was hard for her to cope with the idea of not having softball in her life.</p>
<p>Esparza, who also plays guitar and does standup comedy, tried rugby, but a hard hit to her head convinced her the sport wasn&#8217;t for her.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went right back to the dorm and started making fliers on my computer,&#8221; said Esparza, who then hopped on her mountain bike and began tacking notices announcing a fast-pitch softball meeting all over campus.</p>
<p>Fifteen women showed up and signed a petition to establish the first women&#8217;s competitive fast-pitch softball team at UC Santa Cruz. An earlier softball team had only played in Santa Cruz city league games.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The people Nessa was hanging out with, all these juniors and seniors, told her, &#8216;No way in hell are they going to approve this, especially coming from a freshman like you,&#8217;&#8221; remembered Kevin &#8220;Skippy&#8221; Givens, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s sports clubs director.</p>
<p>&#8220;She just came in as a willful, young freshman and said, &#8216;This is what I want.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what she got.</p>
<p>Esparza wrote a proposal for a women&#8217;s fast-pitch softball team, which was approved as part of a UC Santa Cruz push to get more sports club teams on campus. The team is in its first season, competing as part of the National Collegiate Softball Association&#8217;s Southern Pacific Region against squads from California State University Fullerton, UC Davis, UCLA, USC, UC Merced, and UC Irvine.&#160;</p>
<p>For Esparza, the experience has not only allowed her to play her beloved sport, but it has also given her motivation, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I came here and wanted to start a team and got that done, it&#8217;s like, what else can I do?&#8221; said Esparza, who added her success also led her to get her &#8220;dream job&#8221; as a Sammy the Slug mascot on campus. &#8220;I definitely feel like I can do what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Givens said he was impressed with Esparza&#8217;s drive and focus.</p>
&#8220;She had a vision and she worked hard for that. She also has a strong work ethic. It (the team) really wouldn&#8217;t have happened without Nessa being in place.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="117cd64b8072701713dacb13458ac9ca"><name>hibbert-jones-guggenheim</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz art professor Dee Hibbert-Jones wins 2016 Guggenheim Fellowship</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of art Dee Hibbert-Jones has been awarded a 2016 Guggenheim Fellowship in film and video.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, dee hibbert-jones, ucsc arts division, last day of freedom, 2016 guggenheim fellowship awards</keywords><start-date>1460583600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz art professor wins 2016 Guggenheim Fellowship</display-name><path>/2016/04/hibbert-jones-guggenheim</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/hibbert-jones-guggenheim</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1460582273295</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461348046005</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/Dee-Hibbert-Jones-head-shot-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/Dee-Hibbert-Jones-head-shot-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Dee-Hibbert-Jones-head-shot-350.jpg</name><display-name>Dee Hibbert-Jones-head-shot-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>84769</file-size><width>350</width><height>291</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Art Dee Hibbert-Jones</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/hibbert-jones-thumb1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/hibbert-jones-thumb1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hibbert-jones-thumb1.jpg</name><display-name>hibbert-jones-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25399</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Art Dee Hibbert-Jones</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Art Dee Hibbert-Jones</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of art Dee Hibbert-Jones has been awarded a <a href="http://www.gf.org"><em><strong>2016 Guggenheim Fellowship</strong></em></a> in film and video.<br/>
<br/>
 She is one of 178 artists, scientists, and scholars selected this year by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from a group of 3,000 applicants.<br/>
<br/>
 Guggenheim Fellows are appointed on the basis of distinguished achievement in the past and exceptional promise for future accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
 Hibbert-Jones&#8217;s most recent project was <em>Last Day of Freedom</em>, an animated documentary short film, created in collaboration with San Francisco artist Nomi Talisman. It was nominated for a 2016 Academy Award. Her new project will extend the reach of that film.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The Guggenheim will help fund our animated documentary series that explores the crisis in our criminal justice system through the stories of families with a loved one accused of a capital crime,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;The project unfolds through a trilogy of short films--<em>Last Day of Freedom</em> was the first in this series. We will now focus on a second story from the South.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We aim to raise questions about the criminal justice system,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and ask questions that lie at the heart of our democracy: What does it mean to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217;? Can we equate justice and safety with the police? What systems of protection, punishment and moral codes should exist? What&#8217;s race got to do with it? What about the kids, survivors and victims? Who has the right to take a life?&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Hibbert-Jones noted that the project is a multi-platform documentary trilogy for distribution on public television, in film festivals, on the Internet via webisodes, and as a video installation in museums.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We are currently completing research and early-stage production on the second and third stories,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;It&#8217;s so exciting and such an honor to be awarded the grant.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It is amazing to get support for this issue that is so critical at this time in the U.S.," she added. &#8220;We are at a crossroads in the criminal justice system, and I hope our work can call attention to a complexity of issues.&#8221;<br/>

Sinsheimer Distinguished Lecture in Biology at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, May 5. Schekman's talk, titled "How cells traffic and export proteins," will take place at 7 p.m. in the Colleges Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Schekman will describe the cellular trafficking system that packages proteins in membrane-bound sacs called vesicles, transports them within the cell, and delivers them to the outside of the cell. This pathway is involved in secretion of hormones and enzymes and growth of the cell membrane. Schekman studied this secretory pathway in yeast, and follow-up studies confirmed that higher organisms, including humans, share most of the genes involved in the yeast secretory pathway. Schekman is now applying his findings to investigate human diseases involving problems in the secretory pathway.</p>
<p>Schekman is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has received many awards and honors for his achievements, including the Albert Lasker Award for Basic and Clinical Research, the Gairdner International Award, and the Otto Warburg Medal of the German Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p>
<p>The Sinsheimer Distinguished Lectureship in Biology was established in 1992 by Chancellor emeritus Robert L. Sinsheimer and his wife, Karen. This event is sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="166385db8072701713dacb136488ae26"><name>taps-increases</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposal to increase parking fees</title><summary>Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is proposing a three-year fare increase for most parking fees, as well as the faculty/staff bus pass. </summary><start-date>1460617200000</start-date><display-name>Proposal to increase parking fees</display-name><path>/2016/04/taps-increases</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/taps-increases</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1460664500334</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1460664592612</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is proposing a three-year fare increase for most parking fees, as well as the faculty/staff bus pass. The increase, as proposed, would be effective July 2016. Most parking fees for the campus have not been increased in ten years. Today is the start of a 45-day period where feedback on the proposed fee increase is being solicited from the campus community. Below you will find additional background information.<br/>
<br/>
The full costs for parking operations on University of California campuses are required to be funded by user fees, and state funds may not be used for parking. TAPS provides a comprehensive set of parking services for faculty, staff, students, and campus visitors. In addition to the costs of operating these services, funding is also required to support maintenance of parking and new construction. TAPS parking and program operations include the Sales Office, the Main Entrance Kiosk, Event Parking, Traffic Control, and alternative transportation programs such as the commuter vanpool and bike program. (The Campus Transit Operation, including the Bike Shuttle, is funded by student transit fees and is not a part of this proposal.) Current and anticipated capital construction of new parking includes the new parking lot at the Coastal Science Campus ($1.6 million) and parking for the planned Social Science 3 building ($2 million). Additionally, the parking budget has a required debt obligation for the Core West parking structure, which is an obligation of $810,000/year for the next 15 years.<br/>
<br/>
Although parking policies restrict access for most first- and second-year students, campus growth, increased campus events, and lower fuel costs have contributed to the need to construct additional parking. Construction of a new surface parking space costs $22,000 each, or an average of $50,000 if in a new parking structure. Alternative transit and parking programs are provided to help reduce parking demand and in turn, reduce the need for construction of new parking.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to parking operations, maintenance, and capital construction, the parking budget is required to fund compliance-related improvements, cost share in successful grant proposals (e.g., bike lanes, electric vehicle chargers, "smart" bike lockers, signal improvements), and provide the Traffic Control program. All of these support more efficient parking and transit operations, which in turn improve access for the community.<br/>
<br/>
Key future improvements include expansion of parking capacity around Science Hill, expansion of the East Remote lot, and implementation of a Parking Management System to significantly improve service delivery and reduce staffing costs.<br/>
<br/>
To mitigate the lack of fare increases and operational cost increases, staffing has been reduced by 20 percent over the past six years, even as the number of permit transactions, events, and regulatory requirements has increased substantially. Various processes have been streamlined resulting in additional savings. Unfortunately, and in spite of these efforts, the only way TAPS can continue to deliver services to the campus is by increasing user fees.<br/>
<br/>
The current proposal aims to minimize the impact on those who purchase annual or academic permits as much as possible, and charge more for visitor parking and and short-term parking options (such as daily permits, paystations, or meters). The proposal also includes the expansion of parking requirements to the two UC-owned facilities off campus (Coastal Science Campus and 2300 Delaware) within the next academic year. There are no proposed changes to the definition of a carpool.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/">TAPS website</a> has detailed information about the TAPS operation (including funding and expenses), the full parking fee proposal, and the link to submit comments by May 30.<br/>
<br/>
All comments will be forwarded to Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway. The chancellor may either proceed with approval of the fee proposal, or he may ask for modification. If approved by the chancellor, the fee increases would take effect sometime between July and September of this year.<br/>

You are invited to tune into a live-stream outreach session on Friday, April 22 from 1&#8211;2:30 p.m. I'll be discussing the proposal (and the reasons behind it) in more detail, and answer questions. Details about this session will be sent out to the campus as we get closer to the date.<br/>

An event centered around marijuana and other drugs poses many safety and health concerns.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Many students have strong feelings about "4-20" on our campus. Some feel the event is fun and no big deal, while others who are in recovery from substance addiction find "4-20" is very triggering. Many students worry about environmental impacts in the meadow. A growing number of students see "4-20" and recent negative media attention as harmful to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s reputation.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span size="4" style="font-size: large;"><strong>Challenges</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>For many reasons, "4-20" is challenging. These challenges include the ever-increasing associated costs and significant concerns for health and safety. Financially, the campus is expecting to spend approximately $100,000 this year to have officers and additional support staff on campus to ensure the health and safety of our campus community.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Every year, several students are hospitalized for excessive use of drugs and alcohol during &#8220;4-20.&#8221; Although many associate this event with just marijuana, our experience has been that there are high levels of poly-drug use in the meadow.&#160; This includes alcohol, prescription drugs, Ecstasy (MDMA), LSD, mushrooms, and other drugs. Moreover, those smoking and/or &#160;ingesting highly concentrated forms of marijuana with high THC levels have experienced hallucinations, disorientation, uncontrollable vomiting, and severe dehydration. Some attendees in prior years have become disoriented and combative &#8211; becoming a harm to themselves and others. Therefore we will have a significant presence of police officers throughout the campus to keep those present and the community safe. Our staff have also had to address people who bring small children into the meadow, as well as middle and high school students who are drawn to the event.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since the beginning of the fall quarter, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, Student Health Center, CAPS, and SHOP have come across an increasing number of individuals experiencing a marijuana-induced psychosis, known as &#8220;cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,&#8221; &#160;after using highly concentrated marijuana. In fact, one of the 2015 overdose deaths reported by the Santa Cruz County Coroner&#8217;s Office included a student who died from this syndrome. &#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>We encourage you to engage in dialogue with your peers and talk about the impacts &#8220;4-20&#8221; has on others.</div>
<div><strong><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">&#160;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">Students in recovery: Extra support available on 4-20</span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>For students in long-term recovery from alcohol and/or other drugs; for students who have family members who struggle with alcohol and/or other drugs; and for students new to recovery, "4-20" can be a very hard day. SHOP&#8217;s Alcohol &amp; Other Drug Educator Jorge Bru will be available as well as additional staff to offer support at The Cove, from 2&#8211;6 p.m., located on the lower piazzetta at Kresge College, Suite 153. To learn more about The Cove and our student recovery group Slugs for Health &amp; Growth, contact Jorge Bru at <a href="mailto:jbru@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">jbru@ucsc.edu</a> or <a href="tel:831-459-1417" target="_blank" value="+18314591417">831-459-1417</a>.&#160; Additionally <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/about/index.html">SHOP staff</a> will be available if students need support. <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu">CARE</a> will also open its office as a safe and sober place for students to gather and support each other.</div>
<div><strong><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">&#160;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">If attending 4-20: Tips from SHOP</span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Although we strongly encourage students to refrain from attending &#8220;4-20,&#8221; we want to provide resources if students choose to attend.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If a student is experiencing health issues related to marijuana use they should seek medical attention by calling 911 or alert an emergency responder on scene.</li>
<li>If you see someone who is a danger to themselves or others, please call 911 or alert an emergency responder.</li>
<li>There are many unknowns with edibles and dabs. Please consider the unknown dosage of these items. When people ingest more than their tolerance level of THC they often experience uncontrollable vomiting that can lead to life-threatening dehydration. A large concern is for first-time users who ingest marijuana and have no knowledge of dosage levels or any tolerance with using these drugs.&#160;</li>
<li>If a friend is significantly impacted by alcohol and other drugs after the "4-20" event, do NOT just take them back to their room, tuck them into a bed, and leave them alone. These students need to be observed and cared for. <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/overdose-prevention/index.html">If you see signs of overdose or are concerned about a student&#8217;s health or well-being</a>, contact 911 immediately.&#160;</li>
<li>SHOP advises students to have a &#8220;party plan:&#8221; do not mix substances, stay hydrated, attend with people you know and trust, and always get help when needed.</li>
<li>If you choose to attend this event consider going to observe and NOT use drugs or alcohol. Many students attend to observe and choose to remain sober. No one should feel pressured to smoke or ingest edibles on &#8220;4-20.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>As highlighted in a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/prevalence-of-drugs.html">campuswide email</a> on April 4, there have been multiple news reports regarding UC Santa Cruz students arrested for drug sales and involved in drug-related fatalities.&#160; If you see any students in need of help or recovery support, please direct them to resources available through the <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> (SHOP) program in the Cowell Student Health Center. Faculty and staff needing assistance may seek help through the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a community, we must continue to shift the current paradigm regarding alcohol and other drugs. We must <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></em></strong> engage in candid conversations about the inherent consequences of drug use, especially addressing harm and addiction, while taking the opportunity to reduce the &#8220;romantic&#8221; perception of drug culture. These arrests, the loss of life, and access to the large quantities of drugs, including alcohol and marijuana, should never be considered the norm on our campus.</div>

Legendary social psychologist Elliot Aronson and MacArthur &#8220;Genius&#8221; award&#8211;winning evolutionary microbiologist Beth Shapiro are about to call their classes to order.</p>
<p>These two academic heavy-hitters are going to deliver engaging lectures at this year&#8217;s Teach-Ins, an <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/">Alumni Weekend</a> highlight that allows returning Slugs to go back to school, but this time there will be no pop quizzes, no final examination, just the thrill of learning for its own sake.</p>
<p>Aronson&#8217;s talk will be called &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3423">The Power of Self Persuasion: My 55 Years of Research in One Hour</a>,&#8221; and Shapiro&#8217;s will be called &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3422">How To Clone A Mammoth</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both are at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 30, at Oakes College&#8212;so it will be a tough decision to pick which to attend.</p>
<p><strong>A joyful career</strong></p>
<p>When asked to explain how he has remained in the social psychology field for five and a half decades (and counting), Aronson, one of the most preeminent social psychologists of our time, explained it away with one word: &#8220;Love,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love this field. This field is in a position to help us understand how to help people get along with each other better, reduce prejudice, understand how people can make these horrible mistakes, and how we can help people to learn to correct those mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the physicists have taught us how we can destroy each other, it is the social psychologists who are in the position to teach us how to appreciate each other, like each other, and at least not kill each other,&#8221; Aronson continued. &#8220;That is a promise yet to be totally fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Aronson will have quite a challenge when it comes to compressing his life and career into just one lecture. He conceded that he may have to go over the appointed time limit by five minutes or so.</p>
<p>Aronson, known for his storytelling skill, will likely talk about his two inspiring but temperamentally different mentors, Stanford University&#8217;s prickly and extremely exacting Leon Festinger and Brandeis University&#8217;s warm and humanistic Abraham Maslow.</p>
<p>He could say a thing or two about his ideas on &#8220;cognitive dissonance,&#8221; the mental gymnastics that people do for the sake of self-justification, or the way that hazing rituals tend to increase the hazing subject&#8217;s sense of loyalty and appreciation for organization that is doing the hazing. And he will likely talk about his concept of the &#8220;jigsaw classroom,&#8221; intended to increase cooperation and understanding among diverse groups.</p>
<p><strong>A mammoth undertaking</strong></p>
<p>When you attend Beth Shapiro&#8217;s talk, &#8220;How to Clone a Mammoth,&#8221; expect to be surprised and inspired, but don&#8217;t expect to come away from her discussion with a sure-fire a recipe that will help you go home and create your own tusk-growing furry pal from scratch in your backyard.</p>
<p>Shapiro is a leading authority on ancient DNA&#8212;how to recover it from fossils, museum specimens, and prehistoric remains buried in frozen tundra, and how to analyze it for clues to the evolutionary history of species and populations, both living and extinct. She has studied DNA from ancient populations of bears, horses, humans, and, yes, mammoths. But she is not a big proponent of "de-extinction"&#8212;the idea that scientists could use ancient DNA to recreate extinct species.</p>
<p>In <em>How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction</em> (Princeton University Press, May 2015), Shapiro addressed the scientific and ethical challenges that would confront any effort to bring back extinct creatures.</p>
<p>Her Teach-In will be an opportunity to share her button-pushing ideas. &#8220;I hope to be able to break down some of the misconceptions about what is feasible to achieve, and what is likely to be achieved in the near-term, when it comes to de-extinction,&#8221; Shapiro explained. &#8220;People tend to be both frightened and intrigued by the idea that extinct species might be resurrected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand, de-extinction satisfies a craving for technical solutions to what most people recognize as an ongoing problem&#8212;saving living species from extinction,&#8221; Shapiro continued. &#8220;On the other had, de-extinction is often perceived as dangerous, perhaps because of the connection to science fiction. I'm looking forward to the chance to dig into this a bit, to explore why people are interested in, excited by, afraid of, even offended by de-extinction, while talking through the real science (not science fiction) behind the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advance registration is highly recommended for either event. Seats fill up quickly.</p>

 <br/>
 We will have an increased law enforcement presence with additional UC police officers, as well as allied law enforcement agencies throughout the campus conducting enforcement activities. These officers will conduct enhanced patrols throughout the day, looking for individuals in violation of the law, including the possession of and/or using marijuana and alcohol or other drugs; drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; and will enforce unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food, or medical marijuana on the campus. Campus parking regulations will also be strictly enforced. <br/>
 <br/>
 In addition to enforcing these efforts, <strong>the Santa Cruz Area CHP will be conducting a DUI checkpoint near the west side of campus, aggressively seeking those who choose to drive under the influence</strong>. It is our goal to use this enforcement tool to assist with the reduction of injury and fatal collisions caused by impaired drivers. <br/>
 <br/>
 As a campus we are still processing the very recent horrific <a href="http://www.kionrightnow.com/news/local-news/update-driver-in-deadly-highway-1-crash-behind-bars/38621796">car accident on Highway 1</a> that involved UC Santa Cruz students. This tragedy included marijuana use. Moreover, on April 9, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department arrested a College 9 student for DUI on Coolidge Drive, after being involved in a single vehicle traffic accident. Luckily, in this instance, none of the passengers were injured. We must continue to dialogue about the impacts of drugs and alcohol on this campus and to the greater Santa Cruz community. <br/>
 <br/>
 There are potentially serious consequences of choosing to attend. We ask that individuals consider the risks and possible criminal penalties. Individuals affiliated with the campus are also subject to sanctions by the Student Conduct Office or Human Resources. <br/>
 <br/>
 Please plan accordingly and anticipate possible disruptions to traffic due to the large groups of people that may be present, especially on the west side of campus. Campus and Metro bus service may be delayed. Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas. If driving a vehicle, be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways, as well as the signage indicating the presence of the DUI checkpoint.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police, UC Santa Cruz Police Department </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b487fce8072701713dacb1396c24164"><name>dickson-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two faculty members honored with Dickson Emeriti Professorship Awards</title><summary>Chip Lord, professor emeritus of film and digital media, and Lewis Watts, professor emeritus of art, were each awarded Edward A.

<p><a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/faculty/chip_lord">Chip Lord</a>, professor emeritus of film and digital media, and <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/faculty/lewis-watts">Lewis Watts</a>, professor emeritus of art, were each awarded Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorships in recognition of their outstanding achievements in scholarship and teaching.</p>
<p>The awards are given annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</p>
<p>Lord came to UCSC in 1988 and was chair of the Film and Digital Media Department from 2003&#8211;07. He retired in 2010. Prior to joining UC Santa Cruz, he was a member of the Ant Farm, a groundbreaking, experimental art and architecture collective he founded in 1968 with fellow architect Doug Michels.</p>
<p>Watts joined UC Santa Cruz in 2001 after spending 25 years at UC Berkeley. His research and artwork center on the photography of African American cultural landscapes, where people live, how they occupy and use space, and the traces they leave behind.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b5881e58072701713dacb138f33f329"><name>pulitzers-mendoza-finnegan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alums Martha Mendoza, William Finnegan win 2016 Pulitzer Prize</title><summary>Journalism's highest honor is awarded to the Associated Press and Mendoza for public service and in biography to Finnegan for his surfing memoir.</summary><start-date>1461015900000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Pulitzer Prize winners</display-name><path>/2016/04/pulitzers-mendoza-finnegan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/pulitzers-mendoza-finnegan</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1461016100004</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461597668320</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/martha-mendoza-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/martha-mendoza-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martha-mendoza-300.jpg</name><display-name>martha-mendoza-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>56749</file-size><width>300</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>martha mendoza</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/martha-mendoza-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/martha-mendoza-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martha-mendoza-80.jpg</name><display-name>martha-mendoza-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6178</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>martha mendoza</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, won as part of an Associated Press reporting team, is the second for Martha Mendoza.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/Finnegan-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/Finnegan-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Finnegan-300.jpg</name><display-name>Finnegan-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>112371</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>william finnegan</image-alt><image-caption>New Yorker writer William Finnegan in July 2015 at a Santa Cruz reading and book signing of his memoir "Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life" which has won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for biography.

<p>Two UC Santa Cruz alums won journalism&#8217;s highest honor, the Pulitzer Prize, on Monday (April 18).</p>
<p>Martha Mendoza (Kresge, &#8217;88, independent major, journalism and education) is part of the Associated Press team that exposed the use of slave labor in the Thai seafood industry. The reporting, <a href="http://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/">Seafood From Slaves</a>, traced slave-produced seafood from Asia to major U.S. supermarkets, restaurants, and food suppliers, and resulted in the freeing of 2,000 slaves. The AP won the Pulitzer for public service&#8212;a first for the 170-year-old news agency.</p>
<p>William Finnegan, (Cowell, &#8217;74, English literature) and a <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer since 1987, won in the biography category for his memoir of surfing, <em>Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</em>.</p>
<p>It is the second Pulitzer for Mendoza, an AP national reporter since 1995 who is also a visiting lecturer in the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program. She won in 2000 for <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/99-00/04-10/pulitzer.html">investigative reporting</a> as part of an AP team that revealed the slaughter by American soldiers of hundreds of civilians at the No Gun Ri bridge early in the Korean War.</p>
<p>She is also the second UCSC alumna to win two Pulitzers. Dana Priest won in 2006 for <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/04-17/priest.asp">investigative reporting</a> and 2008 for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/04/2093.html">public service</a> while at the <em>Washington Post.</em> UC Santa Cruz now has six winners of eight Pulitzers. Previous alumni winners are Laurie Garrett, with <em>Newsday</em>; Hector Tobar, and Annie Wells, both of whom were with the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>
<p><strong>No coincidence</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no coincidence that this university has produced so many Pulitzer Prize winners,&#8221; Mendoza said from AP headquarters in New York where she celebrated the award with colleagues Monday. &#8220;It&#8217;s a place where students can better understand their role in our society, writing skills are emphasized, and everyone is encouraged to engage in their community and the broader world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <em>Barbarian Days</em>, Finnegan, a lifelong surfer, writes about his love affair with the waves from his time as a young beginner in California and later Hawaii&#8212;and as a UCSC student in the early 1970s. His favorite local breaks were Stockton Avenue and Four-Mile Beach. He writes of traveling the world in his 20s, seeking waves, and later working in South Africa teaching English under apartheid.</p>
<p>His journalism began with articles from South Africa. He has reported from around the world, often in conflict zones. In talks at UCSC in December 2014 and during a visit to Santa Cruz last July to promote the book, Finnegan spoke of his time on campus and particularly highlighted his work with literature professor (now emeritus) Harry Berger.</p>
<p><strong>Tools to address injustices</strong></p>
<p>Mendoza credits the UCSC journalism lecturer who was her advisor for her independent major with inspiring her journalism in the pursuit of social justice. &#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful my UC Santa Cruz education&#8212;and particularly the ongoing mentorship of Conn Hallinan&#8212;has provided me with tools to address injustices of our world in some small way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She, in turn, has taught journalism and writing at UCSC since 2004, and her students appreciate what motivates her as a journalist. &#8220;I see the world differently now, imbued with the desire to hold people accountable,&#8221; a recent student wrote in a course review, &#8220;to promote justice by abolishing secrecy, and to exploit the public record to inform and empower citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another wrote: &#8220;She made me realize how much this reporting can change people&#8217;s lives, and how necessary it is and will always be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And another, &#8220;It was wonderful that she shared her progress exposing slavery in Thailand fisheries. She was very candid about her moral dilemmas as a journalist trying to do the most good by the victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AP&#8217;s series uncovered how seafood sold in U.S. grocery stores and restaurants was being produced by slaves. Mendoza reported and wrote the series with overseas colleagues Margie Mason, Robin McDowell, and Esther Htusan.</p>
<p>The Public Service award is considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers and is awarded to an organization rather than individuals. This is the AP's 52<sup>nd</sup> Pulitzer.</p>
<p>Pulitzer winners receive $10,000, though the public service Pulitzer is in the form of a gold medal rather than cash.</p>
<p>The project has garnered more than a dozen of journalism&#8217;s highest awards including the $25,000 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting from Harvard University&#8217;s Shorenstein Center, the George Polk Award for foreign reporting, the $35,000 USC Annenberg 2016 Selden Ring Award for investigations that produce results, and the gold Barlett and Steele Award for Investigative Business Journalism.</p>
<p><strong>2,000 enslaved fishermen freed</strong></p>
<p>The investigation led to the freeing of more than 2,000 enslaved fishermen from Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, the jailing of perpetrators, Congressional hearings, and the proposal of new laws. The U.S. State Department used the series as part of its decision to give Thailand the lowest rating for human trafficking and has discussed the findings during diplomatic talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue had been bubbling up a little in Southeast Asia, as some slaves escaped&#8212;but it hadn&#8217;t been getting much attention,&#8221; Mendoza told the Media Guild. &#8220;We set out to do two things that hadn&#8217;t been done before. One was to find people currently working as slaves, to put an end to the suggestions that the problem was behind us. The second thing was to specifically track the supply chain to the major retailers, so they could no longer disassociate themselves from the labor abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winning the awards will&#160;bring more attention to the issue, Mendoza said. &#8220;The enslaved people were risking their lives when they spoke to us. Yet they told their stories with courage and integrity. They deserve the recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mendoza, who lives in Santa Cruz, is planning to move to Thailand with her family in July for a yearlong reporting assignment.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/</url><title>Seafood from slaves: An AP investigation helps free slaves in the 21st century</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.poynter.org/2016/how-the-ap-busted-an-international-seafood-slavery-racket/404046/</url><title>How the AP busted an international seafood slavery racket</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/william-finnegan</url><title>William Finnegan New Yorker archive and bio</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.pulitzer.org/</url><title>Pulitzer Prizes</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f1dfce28072701713dacb13b33cb6c5"><name>thumbs-up-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations deadline extended to May 13 for 2016 Thumbs Up awards</title><summary>Nominations are now being accepted for the annual "Thumbs Up" awards, sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board.

<p>&#8220;This event celebrates our Quincea&#241;era, our coming of age,&#8221; said Pat Zavella, chair of Latin American and Latino studies. &#8220;In the short time we have been a department we have grown to 215 majors, where 84 percent are first generation to attend college. We now have 10 ladder-rank faculty and several have won teaching awards.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>First of its kind</strong></p>
<p>The department was the first of its kind to combine Latino studies with Latin American studies when it was established in 2001 after 30 years as an undergraduate program and major. In 2013, the department launched the first Latin American and Latino studies Ph.D. program in the country.&#160;</p>
<p>The series begins Alumni Weekend with a free public screening of the film &#8220;Mar&#237;a en tierra de nadie / Maria in No Man's Land&#8221; and a discussion with its director Marcela Zamora. It kicks off &#8220;Borders and Belonging: A Series of Events on Human Migration&#8221; presented by the Chicano Latino Research Center.</p>
<p>The film screening will begin at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 28 at the Rio Theatre. It is free and the public is invited; <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html">attendees are asked to register</a> in advance.</p>
<p>The next day, Friday, April 29, will be &#8220;The Jungle and the Beast:&#160; A Conversation with Lewis Watts and &#211;scar Mart&#237;nez&#8221; from 10 a.m.&#8211;noon at the Merrill Cultural Center on the UCSC campus. It, too, is free and open to the public with <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html">advance registration</a>.</p>
<p>The events are also a lead-in to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Sawyer Seminar on non-citizenship that begins with &#8220;Rethinking Migration,&#8221; a two-day conference May 6 and 7. The conference will feature several visiting scholars and UCSC professors in the humanities and social sciences who will focus on issues surrounding migration.</p>
<p><strong>Scholarship on migration</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Since its founding in 1992, the Chicano Latino Research Center has supported scholarship on migration, borders, and citizenship.&#160; The events we&#8217;re planning for this spring and the upcoming academic year will allow us learn from others and to share a bit of the expertise scholars at UCSC have worked hard to cultivate,&#8221; said Catherine S. Ram&#237;rez, associate professor, Latin American and Latino Studies, and CLRC director.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transnationalisms, migration, and displacement are one of the substantive themes of faculty research,&#8221; Zavella said. &#8220;We are excited about the scholarly exchange that will take place in relation to these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Journalist and documentary filmmaker Zamora made &#8220;Mar&#237;a en tierra de nadie&#8221; in 2010, filming in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico.&#160; Her documentary focuses on Salvadoran women migrants and their perilous journeys north through Mexico to the United States.</p>
<p>Zamora has made 14 films about gender and human rights, including &#8220;El cuarto de los huesos / The Room of Bones,&#8221; a documentary released last year about the effort to unearth and identify disappeared people in El Salvador. &#160;She studied journalism in Costa Rica and documentary filmmaking in Cuba and has worked for Al Jazeera, TeleSUR, and Elfaro.net, Latin America's first online newspaper. &#160; &#160;</p>
<p>After the screening, Zamora will discuss her work in a Q&amp;A with UCSC professors John J. Lea&#241;os, film and digital media, and Cecilia Rivas, Latin American and Latino studies.</p>
<p><strong>The Jungle and the Beast</strong></p>
<p>The Jungle and the Beast event on Friday, April 29, features Salvadoran journalist &#211;scar Mart&#237;nez, who wrote <em>The Beast: Riding the Rails and Dodging Narcos on the Migrant Trail</em> (2013). The &#8220;Beast&#8221; is a freight train that travels from Central America through Mexico to the United States and gained notoriety in &#8220;Sin Nombre,&#8221; the first feature film by UC Santa Cruz grad Cary Fukunaga. Mart&#237;nez accompanied Central American migrants who stow away on the Beast to ride north.</p>
<p>He will discuss his experiences with UCSC Professor Emeritus Lewis Watts who, last fall, photographed migrants from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East in &#8220;the&#160;Jungle,&#8221; a refugee camp near Calais, France. Watts will also show and talk about his photographs. Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez, professor of history of art and visual culture, will moderate their conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Borders and Belonging:&#160; A Series of Events on Human Migration&#8221; is supported by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, Chicano Latino Research Center, Division of Social Sciences, University Relations, Institute for Humanities Research, and Department of Latin American and Latino Studies.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://clrc.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/news-article-maria-tierra-nadie-marcela-zamora.html</url><title>More information on film screening</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/events.html</url><title>Information on free event registration</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2016/03/crossing-borders/</url><title>UCSC Magazine: Crossing borders</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fc597028072701713dacb134d771311"><name>cafe-iveta</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cafe Ivéta opens in Quarry Plaza</title><summary>Cafe Ivéta is now open on the ground floor of the Graduate Student Commons building at Quarry Plaza.</summary><start-date>1461074400000</start-date><display-name>Cafe Iveta</display-name><path>/2016/04/cafe-iveta</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/cafe-iveta</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1461090357517</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461091252603</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/cafe-iveta-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/cafe-iveta-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cafe-iveta-400.jpg</name><display-name>cafe-iveta-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>93330</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>exterior of cafe iveta on campus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/iveta-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/iveta-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>iveta-80.jpg</name><display-name>iveta-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>iveta coffee cub</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cafe Iv&#233;ta opened for business, Friday, April 15 in the Graduate Student Commons in Quarry Plaza.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://www.iveta.com/">Cafe Iv&#233;ta</a> is now open on the ground floor of the Graduate Student Commons building at Quarry Plaza.</p>
<p>First day of business was Friday, April 15 after several months of refurbishing and remodeling of the existing restaurant space. The cafe's menu features breakfast, lunch, dinner, espresso, mint spritzers, and fresh squeezed orange juice with a focus on healthy, sustainable ingredients. Beers and wine service is expected soon.</p>
<p>Hours are Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.&#8211;10 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m.&#8211;4 p.m.; closed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cafe Iv&#233;ta offers two service counters. &#160;A main counter takes orders from the menu as well as beverage orders.&#160; A separate back bar counter provides drinks and pastries.</p>
<p>The restaurant space features new tables, refinished chairs, new signage, new custom cabinets, new counters, and new lighting. &#160;</p>
<p>In an effort to provide more sustainable infrastructure on campus, the Graduate Student Commons applied for and received Carbon Fund grants for energy efficient appliances and lighting.&#160; Graduate Student Commons building manager Rachel Neuman thanked the student Carbon Fund committee that approved $25,000 for energy efficient appliances and $7,500 for energy efficient LED lights and daylight harvesting lighting controls. &#160;</p>
<p>Cafe Iv&#233;ta&#8217;s owners said they are dedicated to supporting campus sustainability standards by using compostable and recyclable materials and buying local organic produce and sustainable meats. The cafe is established as an approved campus vendor in the UCSC Cruzbuy purchase system so campus organizations and units can coordinate catering via purchase orders.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus Cafe Iv&#233;ta is the second in Santa Cruz for the Bilanko family. John and Yvette Bilanko first opened Yvette&#8217;s Espresso Bar in 1991 in Barrington, Ill., a Chicago suburb. They also developed a wholesale business manufacturing and distributing scone, muffin, and biscuit mixes. In 1998, with two daughters attending UC Santa Cruz, they sold the caf&#233;, kept the wholesale business, and moved to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In 2010, they opened Cafe Iv&#233;ta on Delaware Avenue where they continue making and distributing artisan baking mixes and also operate a catering business.</p>
<p>Bilanko said he wants the campus cafe to be &#8220;like what we do at our other place, be welcoming to the community.&#8221; His youngest daughter, Danielle, will manage the caf&#233;, and they expect to hire up to 25 part-time student employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make it a place on campus where people like to hang out,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.iveta.com/</url><title>Cafe Iveta website</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/iveta-campus-cafe.html</url><title>Previous coverage</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fd69c8a8072701713dacb133fa39661"><name>peace-corps-hsi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus again ranks No. 1 among Peace Corps’ top volunteer-producing Hispanic-serving institutions</title><summary>Thirty-two alumni are serving in the Peace Corps.

Falc&#243;n, assistant professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, takes on the world&#8217;s largest political and humanitarian organization: the United Nations. She examines how since the 2000s, antiracist feminists from the Americas offer a new and critical perspective to the problem of racism at the UN. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 In <em>Power Interrupted: Antiracist and Feminist Activism Inside the United Nations</em> (University of Washington Press, 2016), Falc&#243;n argues that solving racism requires multiple perspectives and <br/>
 shows how transnational feminist activism can offer needed nuance to important global issues.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Where are the women?</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 In her introduction, Falc&#243;n recalls a memory from the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance (WCAR) in Durban, South Africa&#8211; a moment so powerful that it inspired her research for the decade to follow. <br/>
 <br/>
 Falc&#243;n was a participant at the Non-Governmental Organization Forum Against Racism, a gathering of global activists and advocates who came together to participate in the 2001 WCAR.&#160; She attended the forum&#8217;s closing ceremony. Fidel Castro, then the Cuban president, delivered the closing address. <br/>
 <br/>
 As he made his way to the stadium stage where four men waited for him, a woman in the audience yelled &#8220;Where are the women?&#8221; Instantly, thousands of other women attendees including Falc&#243;n and her friends joined the outcry and shouted the same question.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Although it took several minutes for us to quiet down, the closing ceremony eventually began,&#8221; Falc&#243;n writes. &#8220;But in those commanding minutes, women had challenged the notion that an all-male panel should&#8211;or even could&#8211;make the final remarks about racism at a global gathering. Women had disrupted, if only for a few minutes, a male-centric agenda against racism.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Using a feminist analysis to study racism</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 Falc&#243;n argues that historically, the UN examined social issues independently and as a result, narrowly. Through extensive research in the UN archives, Falc&#243;n saw that for decades the UN handled so-called &#8220;women&#8217;s issues&#8221; in UN women&#8217;s committees or at the world conferences focused on women.&#160; Similarly, the UN viewed problems with race as entirely detached from gender. As a result, it excluded critical issues that disproportionately impacted women of color across the world.<br/>
 <br/>
 But according to Falc&#243;n, race, gender, and class overlap. She says they intersect so profoundly that utilizing distinct, bureaucratic categories and committees is an inadequate way to understand the full scope of human rights.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Gender analysis matters when it comes to understanding racism in its totality,&#8221; writes Falc&#243;n. When a feminist approach is used to explore issues of race, the problem becomes more inclusive and representative, which is vital to effect social and political change.<br/>
 <br/>
 As Falc&#243;n demonstrates, inclusivity is impactful when discussing the political significance of human rights today.&#160; Many of the communities discussed in her book &#8211; women of African descent and indigenous women, for example&#8211;had no place at the table during negotiations involving the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1945. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;When their voices and their issues become now central and visible to our contemporary analysis about racism, then the global discussion about human rights becomes much more meaningful,&#8221; Falc&#243;n says.<br/>
 <br/>
 Falc&#243;n joined UC Santa Cruz in 2010 after having completed a two-year University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Women's Studies Department at UC Riverside. In 2008 she testified at the United Nations in Geneva about sexual violence against migrant women at the U.S.-Mexico border and served as a co-consultant to the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women in 2010.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="307591528072701713dacb131925195c"><name>kenez-emeriti-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>History professor Peter Kenez honored with top UC award for emeriti faculty</title><summary>The 2016 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, honoring emeriti professors in the University of California system, has been awarded to UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of history Peter Kenez. </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, peter kenez, Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, ucop</keywords><start-date>1461102600000</start-date><display-name>history professor peter kenez honored with systemwide award</display-name><path>/2016/04/kenez-emeriti-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/kenez-emeriti-award</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1461101890559</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461105005706</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value><value>Jewish Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/kenez-300-adjusted.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/kenez-300-adjusted.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kenez-300-adjusted.jpg</name><display-name>kenez-300-adjusted.jpg</display-name><file-size>48949</file-size><width>300</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Peter Kenez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/kenez-thumb-adjusted.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/kenez-thumb-adjusted.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kenez-thumb-adjusted.jpg</name><display-name>kenez-thumb-adjusted.jpg</display-name><file-size>26817</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Peter Kenez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of history Peter Kenez</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The 2016 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, honoring emeriti professors in the University of California system, has been awarded to UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of history Peter Kenez.<br/>
<br/>
 The award, which pays tribute to the post-retirement contributions of UC faculty, was presented this year to both Kenez and Isao Fujimoto, professor emeritus of Asian American studies at UC Davis, the 36th and 37th Panunzio awards since the program began in 1983. Kenez's award is the eighth for a retired UC Santa Cruz professor, more than any other UC.<br/>
<br/>
 The selection committee noted that the two professors each had &#8220;especially long and notable records of research, teaching and service to the University of California, their disciplines, and their community.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The Panunzio awards are named for the late professor of sociology at UCLA, often described as the architect of the UC Retirement System. He was particularly active in improving pensions and stipends for his fellow emeriti. The award honors research and activities since retirement and includes a $5,000 prize.<br/>
<br/>
 A founding faculty member of Stevenson College at UC Santa Cruz, Kenez is a native of Hungary and a Holocaust survivor. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University and has been teaching Russian and modern European history at UCSC since 1966. He retired in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
 The committee noted that since Kenez&#8217;s retirement, &#8220;his contributions to education in the Jewish Studies program at UCSC (which he co-founded), among others has been exceptional. While serving on recall and as a leave replacement, Professor Kenez taught several classes on Russian and Soviet history for the university, as well as a seminar on Stalin and Hitler for the History Department. His service and international invitations and his scholarship have continued with no diminution of achievement.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Kenez recently wrote the highly acclaimed book <em>The Coming of the Holocaust: From From Antisemitism to Genocide</em> (2013) and is currently working on a new book, <em>The Gloomy Years of Communism: Hungary 1948-1956.</em></p>

The award, from the Carnegie Corp. of New York, supports high-caliber scholarship in the social sciences and humanities.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s 33 fellows were selected on the originality, promise, and potential impact of their proposals. The award allows recipients to devote one to two years to scholarly research and writing that addresses the most urgent challenges to U.S. democracy and international order.</p>
<p>Massoud&#8217;s proposal, &#8220;Human Rights and Islamic States: Can Religion Rebuild the Rule of Law After War?&#8221; builds on his research on law in conflict settings and on Islamic law and society. At UC Santa Cruz, Massoud teaches courses in international law, human rights, and comparative law.</p>
<p>Massoud&#8217;s first book, <em><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/socio-legal-studies/laws-fragile-state-colonial-authoritarian-and-humanitarian-legacies-sudan">Law's Fragile State: Colonial, Authoritarian, and Humanitarian Legacies in Sudan</a></em> (Cambridge University Press), received awards from the <a href="http://www.lawandsociety.org/prizes/jacob_winners.htm">Law and Society Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.apsanet.org/section-2-c-herman-pritchett-award">American Political Science Association</a>. In it he traces how colonial administrators, post-colonial governments, and the international aid community each used law to build stability amid political violence and civil war in Sudan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply grateful for the support I have received from my colleagues and students at UCSC in the politics department, the legal studies program, and beyond,&#8221; Massoud said after the announcement was made in New York.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal nominated Massoud for the fellowship, noting his work on the politics of law &#8220;resides in the best traditions of the humanities and social sciences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massoud joins other Carnegie fellows who will provide new perspectives on firearms in America, abolition of prisons, impact of economic growth on climate change, resettlement of refugees, future of the Middle East, and famine in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>This is the second year for the Carnegie Fellows program that supports scholars, journalists, and authors whose work distills knowledge, enriches culture, and equips leaders in science, law, technology, business, and public policy.</p>
<p>The nominating process entailed three levels of review and began with the Carnegie Corp. seeking recommendations from more than 600 leaders of universities, think tanks, publishers, and nonprofit organizations. They nominated some 200 candidates, whose proposals were evaluated by an anonymous team of prominent scholars and intellectuals. A panel of 16 jurors, including heads of the country&#8217;s premier scholarly institutions and presidents of leading universities and foundations, made the final selections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our founder, Andrew Carnegie, charged Carnegie Corp. with the task of creating, advancing, and diffusing knowledge in order to enlighten American society and strengthen our democracy.

But when he got home and looked at the footage, it was not what he'd expected.</p>
<p>"I was really careful and thought I was doing a great job, but the video was super shaky, with shots of the sky and the ground&#8212;nothing like the GoPro advertisements," he said. "And I had sacrificed my own snowboarding experience to get this disappointing video."</p>
<p>Mentese, a graduate student in electrical engineering at UC Santa Cruz's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, figured there must be a technological solution. He recruited a team&#8212;most of them either current students or alumni of UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and went to work. The device they developed, called Raven, is a wearable, robotic camera stabilization system, powered by artificial intelligence, that can lock onto a moving target and automatically track it to capture smooth, continuous video footage of the selected target. The company they founded, <a href="http://www.reflexrobotics.com/">Reflex Robotics</a>, is preparing to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds so they can start manufacturing the Raven.</p>
<p><strong>Hannover Messe<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>The team took first place in the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://cied.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/business-design-showcase.html">Business Design Showcase</a> on April 12. In late April, Mentese is joining a UC delegation to the <a href="http://www.hannovermesse.de/en/exhibition/facts-figures/">Hannover Messe</a> international trade show in Germany, where the project will be featured in the UC exhibit booth. Hannover Messe is the world's leading trade fair for industrial technology. Sue Carter, director of UCSC's <a href="http://cied.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</a> (CIED), nominated Mentese for this opportunity.</p>
<p>"When I first met with Enes, he was very poised, and I thought he had a great idea and was the type of person who could execute it and make it happen," Carter said. "I don't often sit down with a grad student and think they'd be a good entrepreneur."</p>
<p>Carter, a physicist who has launched three start-up companies herself, said she was impressed by what the team had been able to accomplish on a shoestring budget. Their prototypes look like marketable products, not clunky mock-ups with loose wires hanging out.</p>
<p>"Hardware technology is really hard to do," she said. "If you can actually build a product and have an idea how to get it manufactured, that requires special talent. The image processing software is also quite sophisticated, so those are two difficult challenges they were able to pull off with almost no support."</p>
<p><strong>Computer vision</strong></p>
<p>Seongdo Kim, a graduate student in computer engineering, is a cofounder of Reflex Robotics and one of the first people Mentese asked to help with the project. For his Ph.D., Kim is working on computer vision technology with Roberto Manduchi, professor of computer engineering and head of the Computer Vision Lab at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Seongdo is our computer vision and machine learning expert," Mentese said. "After taking a class together and seeing his research firsthand, I knew he'd be the perfect addition to the team."</p>
<p>Cofounder Abdo Babukr (B.S. from UC Santa Cruz, M.S. from San Jose State University, both in electrical engineering) is the team's embedded systems and digital signal processing expert. Mentese's brother Zubeyir, who has a degree in business management economics from UC Santa Cruz, brings business experience as the founder of CopterOptics, a drone videography company. The fifth current member of the team is Brent Bucci, a UCSC alumnus with experience in technology communications and startup management.</p>
<p>Their product is designed for action sports videography and other extreme environments where traditional camera control is not possible. It is small enough to be mounted on a helmet or a drone, using a standard GoPro mount. A GoPro camera fits into the device, which has its own camera feeding data to the embedded computer system, as well as accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes for stabilization.</p>
<p>Through an app on a smart phone or tablet, the user sees what the Raven sees and can select the object or person to be tracked. After that, the intelligent system takes over and the camera automatically follows the target while both camera and target are on the go, even if the view is momentarily obstructed.</p>
<p>"It's very computationally intensive, but we wanted to keep the system small and compact, so it was a complex project in terms of both the hardware development and the software development," Mentese said.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong></p>
<p>The Raven uses Nvidia's Jetson platform for embedded visual computing, and the custom software code enables the system to "learn" to recognize the object being tracked as it moves and changes position. This active machine learning during tracking is one of the keys to making the system robust and reliable, Mentese said.</p>
<p>"Robotics is the new thing, but a robot is only as good as its ability to perceive the outside world," he said. "Computer vision and machine learning is the ultimate sensor for robotics. We have a whole list of other project ideas we plan to pursue after Raven."</p>
<p>For Mentese and Kim, however, balancing their work on a startup company with their work as graduate students has been a challenge. "It's been hard. We don't get a lot of weekends off," Kim said.</p>
<p>Mentese said he is excited to be going to the Hannover Messe trade show as one of only two student entrepreneurs in the UC delegation. "It's a huge honor to be invited, and a great opportunity to spread the word about Raven," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.facebook.com/reflexrobotics/</url><title>Reflex Robotics Facebook page</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/business-design-winners.html</url><title>Student entrepreneurs pitch business ideas at annual showcase in Silicon Valley</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="34d90d6d8072701713dacb13aa0f0c63"><name>nasa-missions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Jonathan Fortney prepares for Cassini mission's grand finale</title><summary>NASA has tapped Fortney to support the final act of its Cassini mission and serve on a science team starting to plan for a potential future mission to Uranus or Neptune.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney, Cassini Mission, Ice Giants Mission, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune</keywords><start-date>1461250800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Jonathan Fortney prepares for Cassini mission's grand finale</display-name><path>/2016/04/nasa-missions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/nasa-missions</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1461175519273</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461252237449</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/grand-finale-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/grand-finale-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grand-finale-400.jpg</name><display-name>grand-finale-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>55592</file-size><width>400</width><height>246</height></image><image-alt>diagram of grand finale orbits around Saturn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/jfortney-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/jfortney-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jfortney-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jfortney-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21509</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jonathan Fortney</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Cassini will end its historic mission with 22 daring loops passing through the gap between Saturn and the innermost ring.

Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will be using that data to learn about the internal structure of the mysterious giant planet.</p>
<p>Fortney is one of four new participating scientists NASA has chosen for the last phase of Cassini's highly successful mission to Saturn. He said the data gathered during the spacecraft's final orbits will yield precise maps of the gravity and magnetic fields of the planet, giving scientists new insights into Saturn's interior structure and composition, including the mass of its deep core and the density of its outer layers.</p>
<p>"We'll have a much better understanding of how the planet works," Fortney said. He noted that NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter, which will arrive at that planet in July, will also be gathering data on gravitational and magnetic fields, enabling a great opportunity to compare these two giant worlds. Saturn and Jupiter are both gas giants composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with relatively small rocky cores.</p>
<p>"We really don't know what their interiors are like," Fortney said. "What's great is that, in the space of a year, we'll have once-in-a-lifetime data sets for both Jupiter and Saturn."</p>
<p><strong>Exoplanets</strong></p>
<p>In addition to studying the planets in our own solar system, Fortney is interested in the structure and physics of planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets). He was a member of the science team for NASA's Kepler mission during its prime mission, which has discovered over 1,000 confirmed exoplanets and nearly 4,000 new candidates that have yet to be confirmed. Understanding the planets of our own solar system is important for scientists trying to make sense of new observations of distant exoplanets, he said.</p>
<p>"The internal structure of planets touches on how they form and evolve over time. This is an important time for us to understand our own gas giants for comparison to exoplanets," Fortney said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Ice giants</strong></p>
<p>As he prepares for the final stages of the Cassini mission, Fortney is also engaged in the initial planning for a possible future mission to Uranus or Neptune, or both. A mission to one of the two "ice giants" was among the top priorities identified by the National Research Council's most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. While NASA has not committed to flying such a mission, the agency does want to better define what it might look like. Fortney is one of 14 scientists chosen by NASA, including two from the European Space Agency, to serve on the Science Definition Team for an ice giants mission concept study.</p>
<p>The team met recently at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which is leading the study, to begin planning a strategy to maximize the scientific payoff from an ice giants mission. Fortney said there is a possibility for missions to go to both planets, although that constrains what can be done at either planet. The only previous mission to visit the ice giants was Voyager 2, which flew by Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.</p>
<p>"The two planets look very much alike, but they are dramatically different in the amount of energy coming out of their interiors," Fortney said. "Neptune is ten times brighter than Uranus in the thermal radiation coming out of its interior. We don't know why, and we don't know which one is a better example for exoplanets in that size range. It's probably one of the biggest remaining science questions for the outer solar system."</p>
<p>The launch window under consideration by the ice giants mission study is sometime between 2025 and 2037, and it would take about ten years for the spacecraft to reach Uranus. "It might get there and start sending back data around 2045, around the time that I'll be retiring," Fortney said. "It's a little bewildering, but at the same time very exciting to be thinking about that."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="35127a4b8072701713dacb136799e563"><name>spring-plant-sale-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden’s annual spring plant sale takes place April 30 and May 1</title><summary>With winter rains and April showers greening yards and moistening garden beds, the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden’s spring plant sale comes at the perfect time.</summary><start-date>1461178800000</start-date><display-name>Spring plant sale</display-name><path>/2016/04/spring-plant-sale-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/spring-plant-sale-2016</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1461179282716</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461180155323</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/spring-plant-sale-525.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/spring-plant-sale-525.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-plant-sale-525.jpg</name><display-name>spring-plant-sale-525.jpg</display-name><file-size>208853</file-size><width>525</width><height>358</height></image><image-alt>plants for sale </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/spring-plant-sale-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/spring-plant-sale-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-plant-sale-80.jpg</name><display-name>spring-plant-sale-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>13165</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>plant sale poster image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Vegetable growers will find a great selection of tomatoes and peppers (sweet and hot), along with eggplants, Asian greens, summer and winter squashes, pumpkins, lettuces, salad mix, a wide variety of basil, cucumbers, kale, and more.

 At 11 a.m., Edgar Flores of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden will share the history of some of the plants being offered for sale, and discuss their indigenous names and cultural significance, along with the impacts of European botanists on the naming system in use today. &#8220;A good example is the dahlia,&#8221; says Flores. &#8220;Its original Aztec name was cocoxochitl, which means water-stemmed flower or hollow-stemmed flower, and it played an important role in Aztec culture. Today it&#8217;s known worldwide and is an important economic crop.&#8221;<br/>

<p>While the &#8220;stars&#8221; turned out to be planes on their approach to Los Angeles International Airport, they nevertheless set off a longing in a kid who would grow up to become an Air Force captain, a pilot, a skydiving instructor, a co-principal investigator on a satellite mission, the author of a published paper about a strange moon named Phobos, and now a third-year grad student in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nayak won the $3,000 grand prize in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s second annual Grad Slam competition. He will now go on to represent UC Santa Cruz at the UC-wide Grad Slam finals April 22 at LinkedIn headquarters in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing stars amidst the smog was always a treat,&#8221; says Nayak, 29, who goes by "Mikey". &#8220;Over time that turned into something I really care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spend an hour with Nayak and you&#8217;ll walk away with stories about pilot emergencies, quivering skydiving students, hopping moons, gravitational modeling, and why we should figure out a way to live on Mars.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll tell you about the excitement of leading a mission to launch a unique shoe-box-sized satellite into space. He&#8217;ll talk of joining the military because it afforded him the opportunity to do the kinds of things he wanted at a young age, including being named lead flight director for a project that involved a military reconnaissance satellite that was about to re-enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Nayak was 24 at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;To put it in perspective,&#8221; he says, &#8220;flight directors for NASA missions are usually in their early 40s.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not bragging when Nayak says these things. Rather, they seem to come from a place of enthusiasm and excitement for discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re a planetary scientist, you really learn about how little you know,&#8221; Nayak says at one point as he explains his research into a planetary system named Kepler-32 and his work on Mars&#8217;s mysterious moon called Phobos.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sets him apart as a researcher,&#8221; says his mentor and UC Santa Cruz Emeriti Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Erik Asphaug, &#8220;is that he&#8217;s clamoring for good ideas to work on, and enthusiastic about what can be done to turn a hypothesis&#8212;that is, an eggheaded idea on a blackboard or on a paper napkin&#8212;into a substantial theory backed up by formidable sets of calculations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take Mars&#8217;s moon, Phobos, for instance. For 40 years, scientists have wondered about the strange grooves on this lumpy, potato-shaped moon. Part of the explanation for the grooves was that they were stretch marks caused by the spiral pull of Mars, which is slowly sucking the moon back to itself. Not all of the channels fit that model, however.</p>
<p>Working with Asphaug, who is now part of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, Nayak was able to use gravitational modeling to show that some of the mysterious grooves were caused by debris from asteroid hits that rose up and, thanks to the tidal forces of the close-by Mars, fell back to the moon days or weeks later.</p>
<p>His discovery opened up a new field of study and of planetary data analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what Mikey has done for Phobos, is basically to pound a peg into the sand around which we can anchor a lot of modern theories,&#8221; Asphaug says.</p>
<p>Nayak and Asphaug have submitted a proposal to NASA to look further into the nature of this unique moon.</p>
<p>Nayak, who is supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, is also interested in faraway planetary systems, including one called Kepler-32. That system contains five close-by planets whose gravities, like bullies in a schoolyard, are constantly fighting for dominance.</p>
<p>Nayak&#8217;s research showed not only that moons could exist in this system but also what they might look like, and the fact these moons could hop from one planet to another because of shifting regions of gravitational stability. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These cramped systems are more common than our sparse solar system,&#8221; Nayak says of Kepler-32. &#8220;So if that&#8217;s the norm and we&#8217;re not, that&#8217;s what we really need to understand. Maybe that will give insights into why we&#8217;re different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion of distant solar systems turns to Nayak&#8217;s hope that humans might, one day, be able to survive on Mars. His eyes light up as he talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, in the future, we will find it really important to understand other worlds and therefore our limitations within them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be an old man before then, but it would be super cool to sit back and say: &#8216;Back in my day I helped make that happen.&#8217;&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

href="https://deyoung.famsf.org/calendar/20th-annual-new-generations-student-showcase-sanctuary-0"><em><strong>20th annual New Generations Student Showcase: Sanctuary</strong></em></a> in San Francisco on April 22-24.<br/>
<br/>
 The three-day event includes a juried showcase of visual art and film with museum talks, music, and performance by university and college art students--inspired by the theme, <em>Sanctuary</em>, and by the de Young's permanent collections and special exhibitions.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Rachel Smith&#8217;s</strong> piece, <em>How Many Syrians #4</em>, is from a dramatic and reflective series of six works on the plight of migrating Syrians. It combines the despair of the Syrian migration with the impossibility of welded steel life vests.<br/>
<br/>
 A 42-year-old re-entry transfer student now in her junior year at UC Santa Cruz, Smith lives in Family Student Housing with her husband and three-year-old daughter. She said she has worked as a bead artist for 20 years, teaching internationally and writing three books on beadwork with print runs of 20,000 copies.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Since fall of 2015, I&#8217;ve won $5K in scholarships and learned to weld,&#8221; Smith noted. &#8220;Preparing for the de Young show I discussed the opportunity with my fellow students. So few of them had heard of the open call that I decided to hold a show at the Bridge Gallery in Porter College modeled exactly after the de Young show and hopefully encourage people to apply."</p>
<p>"The show was a success with 18 students participating and one of them<strong>--Austin Carlson</strong>--getting into the de Young show as well. I&#8217;ll be bringing his work up to the museum for him.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Smith described Carlson&#8217;s paintings as a reflection of life and death. &#8220;While painting, he attempts to reconcile the polarities between these concepts and understand how they relate to one another.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Jocelyn Lozano&#8217;s</strong> contribution to the show will be <em>Untitled 1</em>, a work from her short digital photography series <em>Hold You</em>, which touches on themes of love, security, and mental illness. Lozano is an art and psychology double major, now in her junior year at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>

<p>An astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Walkowicz studies stellar magnetic activity and its influence on planetary habitability using data from NASA's Kepler Mission. She is also a 2012 TED Senior Fellow and an artist working in a variety of media, including comics, oil paint, and sound. Her talk, "The Search for Life in the Universe," is presented by the UC Santa Cruz Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and UC Observatories as part of the Mandel Lecture Series.</p>
<p>Although humans have long wondered whether other worlds like the Earth exist in the universe, only within the past few years has a scientific answer begun to emerge. The recent boom in exoplanet discoveries, many from NASA's Kepler Mission, suggests that our galaxy teems with other worlds. Some of these new planets may resemble our own Earth, but many are truly alien. Walkowicz will take the audience on a tour of exoplanet discoveries and discuss how astronomers are investigating these alien planets and searching for evidence of life.</p>

Although this was a notable decrease from the prior two years, we estimate that 60 to 70 percent of participants were not affiliated with UC Santa Cruz, and their presence still created a significant burden for our campus.</p>
<p>Our public safety actions were primarily centered around three objectives: keeping the peace, caretaking the community, and enforcing the law in a reasonable and appropriate manner. We had an obligation to make sure faculty, staff, students, and our neighboring community remained safe throughout the day, without solely focusing on the Porter Meadow. Fortunately there weren't any major incidents. However, officers did make several arrests that helped to maintain a safe campus:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 4 p.m., officers conducted a traffic stop on Heller Drive at the Redwood Grove Apartments and arrested two Castroville men, ages 20 and 22, on suspicion of felony possession of a loaded firearm, possession of a concealed firearm, transportation of marijuana for sales, and possession of marijuana for sales. Officers found more than three ounces of marijuana and a fully loaded high-capacity magazine in their vehicle.</li>
<li>One non-affiliate was arrested for felony possession of a knife and club, along with possession of marijuana on Coolidge Drive at the "lookout."</li>
<li>During the three hours that the California Highway Patrol operated a sobriety checkpoint at Heller Drive and Empire Grade Road, officers reported that hundreds of vehicles passed through the checkpoint. Three arrests were made: one for DUI involving alcohol, two for DUI involving marijuana.</li>
<li>Approximately 25 individuals were cited for possession of marijuana. Dozens more were warned.</li>
<li>One individual was cited for being a minor in possession of alcohol. Approximately 125 individuals were cited for traffic-related violations.</li>
<li>One individual was arrested for being intoxicated in public and battery on an officer as the subject resisted by spitting on the officer while being taken into custody. Another individual was arrested for being intoxicated in public and resisting arrest.</li>
<li>At approximately 6 p.m., a female student was transported to the hospital due to the effects of marijuana ingestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Officers on duty came from all 10 UC campuses, the California Highway Patrol, Santa Cruz Police Department, and Capitola Police Department. The City of Santa Cruz Fire Department was also on scene at the Porter Meadow for the majority of the day.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, UC Santa Cruz Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4fb7bd708072701713dacb132a0b16f4"><name>percolating-ideas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Percolating ideas</title><summary>Grad student Sarah Beganskas is studying what could become part of the solution to California’s water crisis: collecting storm runoff so it can seep into the ground instead of being diverted to rivers and seas.</summary><keywords>Grad student Sarah Beganskas is studying what could become a part of the solution to California’s water crisis: collecting storm runoff so it can seep into the ground instead of diverting it to rivers and seas</keywords><start-date>1461567600000</start-date><display-name>Percolating ideas</display-name><path>/2016/04/percolating-ideas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/percolating-ideas</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1461626320942</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461626521311</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/beganskas-sarah.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/beganskas-sarah.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beganskas-sarah.jpg</name><display-name>beganskas-sarah.jpg</display-name><file-size>44850</file-size><width>404</width><height>604</height></image><image-alt>Sarah Beganskas, 25, a fourth-year grad student at UC Santa Cruz, has found herself ankle </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/beganskas-sarah-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/beganskas-sarah-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beganskas-sarah-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>beganskas-sarah-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3466</file-size><width>84</width><height>84</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sarah Beganskas, 25, a fourth-year grad student at UC Santa Cruz, has found herself ankle </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sarah Beganskas,&#160;25, a fourth-year grad student at UC Santa Cruz, has found herself ankle deep in mud and coated with fine dust as she studies storm water runoff.

<p>The 25-year-old, fourth-year grad student at UC Santa Cruz has found herself ankle deep in mud and coated with fine dust as she studies what may, one day, be a part of the solution to California&#8217;s water crisis: collecting storm runoff so it can percolate into the ground instead of diverting it to rivers and seas.</p>
<p>A native of Long Island, New York, Beganskas is curly-haired, thoughtful, and not easily discouraged, which is an important trait when trying to gather storm-water data in the midst of a prolonged drought.</p>
<p>&#8220;An important part of science and research is that things don&#8217;t always go as you planned,&#8221; Beganskas says. &#8220;But there are still valuable lessons you can learn from what you do and conclusions you can draw based on your results&#8212;even if it&#8217;s not what you hoped for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Andrew Fisher, Beganskas&#8217;s &#8220;lab&#8221; is a four-acre infiltration pond located on a working farm near the Pajaro River in Watsonville. The pond is designed to catch storm runoff from a surrounding 170-acre tract, allowing it to percolate back into the Aromas Aquifer which, like a failing bank, is currently experiencing more withdrawals than deposits.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to recharge 100 acre-feet of water per year by using the pond. One hundred acre-feet (123,000 cubic meters) of water is enough to supply 200 families of four for 12 months. But, because of the drought, that goal was elusive. Then, in December 2014, a big storm hit the area, dumping more than four inches of rain in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Water that usually ran into the Pajaro River was, instead, corralled in the infiltration pond where it filtered back into the aquifer. The goal of returning 100 acre-feet of water into the ground was met.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my first-order findings is that this sort of system can work,&#8221; Beganskas says of her research. &#8220;Another finding was that, even in a severe drought, the potential is there to collect a lot of runoff during intense storm events.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are important findings, not only for the Pajaro Valley where up to a dozen of these ponds could recharge about 10 percent of needed groundwater, but also for the rest of California. According to the state&#8217;s 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, local agencies will be charged with managing groundwater.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of work I&#8217;m doing is something many of those agencies might turn to in the next decade or so as they come up with a plan to increase groundwater sustainability across the state,&#8221; Beganskas says.</p>
<p>Her mentor, Fisher, agrees, pointing to the Pajaro Valley site.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These kinds of systems (infiltration ponds) can help the basin to restore hydrologic system services like it did before it was urbanized and developed for agriculture,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This approach will not solve all the problems, but it is a piece of the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Beganskas, who earned her undergraduate degree in geology and computer science at Amherst College in Massachusetts, doing work that was relevant to everyday lives was important.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to work on something I could see with my own eyes,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>It was also important for Beganskas to help ensure more diversity in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math&#8212;all notoriously populated by white males. To that end, she and other UC Santa Cruz grad students formed a group called GEODES (Geologists Encouraging Openness and Diversity in Earth Sciences), which aims to help women and minorities succeed in the Earth sciences.</p>
<p>The group has held gatherings to build community and also hosted workshops on topics like growth mindset versus fixed mindset and the so-called Imposter Syndrome in which people, especially minorities and women in STEM fields, may feel inadequate and thus have to &#8220;fake&#8221; confidence.</p>
<p>Says Fisher: &#8220;Sarah is smart, creative, and goal oriented. She also has very strong common sense and sees how to solve problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if that means standing in the middle of muddy field.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="535dd7638072701713dacb13b7cf7d66"><name>police-videos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student-made videos focus on sexual assault awareness, reporting options</title><summary>The five videos, sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, will debut at 7 p.m., April 27 at the Stevenson Event Center.</summary><keywords>sexual assault awareness, student video, reporting, police</keywords><start-date>1461654000000</start-date><display-name>Sexual assault awareness</display-name><path>/2016/04/police-videos</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/police-videos</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1461687538181</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461687538181</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Five videos made by UC Santa Cruz students that help bring awareness to sexual assault and reporting options will make their debut at 7 p.m., April 27 at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>

<p>Transportation and Parking Services, in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, has launched <a href="http://slugroute.com">SlugRoute</a>, a desktop and mobile-friendly web app, that's powered by the Bus Tracking System, a hardware and software platform that tracks the movement of campus shuttles using a series of GPS transmitters and base stations across UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The project was driven by a group of entrepreneurial graduate and undergraduate students who saw a need on campus that could be solved with today's technology.</p>
<p>"SlugRoute makes it easy to see if the next loop shuttle is minutes away," said Larry Pageler, director of Transportation and Parking Services.</p>
<p>Besides providing a real-time tracking system for campus transit buses, the project team also fabricated new destination signs for the shuttle fleet.</p>
<p>"This was a win/win project for TAPS and the students, as well as the campus community who rely on our shuttles to travel across campus," Pageler said.</p>
<p>For TAPS, the benefits of SlugRoute are two-fold: the platform can help students decide whether they should wait for a campus shuttle or hop on a Metro, which will potentially preserve space on Metro buses for those needing to get off-campus. There may also be some cost savings, since the campus pays the same amount for every student who rides a Metro bus, regardless of whether they go from Kresge to Cowell or Science Hill to downtown.</p>
<p>The Bus Tracking System, which is the underlying technology behind the web app, was started by students of computer engineering Professor Katia Obrackza, who initially pitched it as a project for undergraduates looking for a senior design project.</p>
<p>"They have to do senior capstone projects, so I pitched this idea to them," said Obrackza. "They took it over, designed the system, and had a prototype."</p>
<p>The prototype (which relied on the cellular network) was not the most effective design. Graduate student Kerry Veenstra took on the project, redesigning as part of his thesis. Transmitters installed on the campus shuttles send GPS coordinates to be shown on SlugRoute.</p>
<p>The effort to create this tool for the campus posed several engineering challenges for the students.</p>
<p>Another group of students on the project, working with electrical engineering Professor Stephen Petersen, had to figure out the best location for an array of base stations to receive the GPS signals.</p>
<p>Also, campus buses can be used for either the loop route or the upper campus route, so students installed small black boxes that have a switch that can let the Bus Tracking System know which route they're servicing.</p>
<p>The web app piece&#8212;SlugRoute&#8212;was designed by Wade "Simba" Khadder, an undergraduate in computer science who took a prototype to a UCSC Hackathon before meeting with Pageler. Pageler later connected Khadder with the rest of the BTS group, so that they could merge their work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="54df6f388072701713dacb13b3fd9258"><name>estes-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book by ecologist James Estes recounts pioneering research in Alaska</title><summary>Known for groundbreaking research on sea otters and coastal ecosystems, Estes tells the story of his influential career in marine science.</summary><keywords>James Estes, Jim Estes, sea otter kelp forest trophic cascade, sea otters, Serendipity</keywords><start-date>1461769200000</start-date><display-name>New book by ecologist James Estes recounts pioneering research in Alaska</display-name><path>/2016/04/estes-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/estes-book</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1461712808369</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461773918298</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/cover-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/cover-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-400.jpg</name><display-name>cover-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>131322</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14160</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image from book cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/jim-estes-265.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/jim-estes-265.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-estes-265.jpg</name><display-name>jim-estes-265.jpg</display-name><file-size>62167</file-size><width>265</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt>James Estes</image-alt><image-caption>James Estes (photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Known for groundbreaking research on the ecological role of sea otters in coastal ecosystems, Estes tells the story of an eventful and influential career in marine science</article-subhead><article-text><p>In his new book, <em>Serendipity: An Ecologist's Quest to Understand Nature</em> (<a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520285033">UC Press, May 2016</a>), marine ecologist James Estes recounts the simple twists of fate that sent him to the Aleutian Islands in 1970 to study the distribution and abundance of sea otters. It was the start of a remarkable journey of discovery that led to profound insights about the complexity of ecological interactions and the importance of predators in natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Now a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Estes has returned to the Aleutian Islands nearly every year after that first visit, developing a deep knowledge of the area's natural history and witnessing dramatic changes in its ecosystems. In <em>Serendipity</em>, he starts with his research on sea otters and kelp forests, shows how one question led to another, and explains the broader principles of ecology illuminated by his findings.</p>
<p>"I try to not only tell the story of the science, but also give an explanation of how it came about and highlight why it's important to the science of ecology," Estes said.</p>
<p><strong>Keystone species</strong></p>
<p>His research showed that sea otters are a "keystone species" that maintains kelp forest ecosystems by controlling populations of kelp-grazing sea urchins. Sea otters had been hunted to near extinction for the fur trade, and the recovery of their populations was uneven and fragmented across the Aleutian Archipelago. This enabled Estes to compare coastal ecosystems around islands with and without sea otters, and he found that there were no kelp forests without sea otters.</p>
<p>His findings have become a classic example of how apex predators shape ecosystems. Estes continued to build on his early observations over the following decades, carefully documenting the interactions among sea otters, sea urchins, and other elements of kelp forest ecosystems. He conducted long-term studies tracking the changes at sites where sea otters recolonized an island and expanded their numbers, and at other sites where once thriving populations underwent sudden declines.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected collapse</strong></p>
<p>The unexpected collapse of sea otter populations in parts of the Aleutian Archipelago in the 1990s led the research in new directions. Estes concluded that the likely cause of the decline was predation by killer whales. But why had killer whales begun preying on sea otters? It appeared to be part of a broader "megafaunal collapse" that included several species of seals and sea lions.</p>
<p>Estes and others proposed that industrial whaling had forced a dietary shift in killer whales that had previously preyed on large whales. As the great whales became scarce, the killer whales turned to smaller marine mammals, including seals, sea lions, and sea otters, all of which underwent marked population declines. This remains a controversial hypothesis, and Estes devotes a chapter of the book to the ongoing debate.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has led international teams of scientists investigating how a broad range of ecosystems have been disrupted by the decline of large predators and other "apex consumers" at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>"Natural ecosystems are strongly influenced by these big predators," Estes said. "The top predators have really important roles in the way ecosystems are structured and how they operate, and the loss of these animals as part of the erosion of biodiversity is an issue of global significance."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Serendipity</strong></p>
<p>The book's title, <em>Serendipity</em>, reflects the unpredictable and often surprising course of his research career, Estes said. "So much of the process of science has to do with fortuitous events, the people you meet, and the ideas that surface during informal conversations."</p>
<p>A crucial encounter for Estes was a brief conversation in 1971 with the pioneering ecologist Robert Paine during a visit Paine made to Amchitka Island, where Estes was based. Estes had been observing a thriving sea otter population around Amchitka Island, diving in the kelp forests, and trying to come up with an idea for a Ph.D. thesis. Inspired by Paine, he organized a trip to another island in the Aleutian archipelago where the sea otter population had never recovered.</p>
<p>"That was probably the most exciting moment in my career, when I first went to an island that lacked sea otters and stuck my head in the water, and I saw how incredibly different it was," Estes said. "That was such a powerful experience, probably the most defining moment of my life, and it happened in less than a second."</p>
<p>Estes, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1978, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2014. He is also a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and has received the Western Society of Naturalists' Lifetime Achievement Award, a Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship, and the C. Hart Merriam Award of the American Society of Mammalogists.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/07/apex-consumers.html</url><title>Loss of large predators has caused widespread disruption of ecosystems</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/98-99/10-19/killer.htm</url><title>Killer whales feed on sea otters, pushing coastal ecosystems off kilter</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/01/1042.html</url><title>New book explores the effects of whales and whaling on ocean ecosystems</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5e89b0b88072701713dacb135295d2a8"><name>athletics-faq</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Frequently asked questions on intercollegiate athletics</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz offers undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in club sports, as well as NCAA Division III intercollegiate athletics.</summary><keywords>athletics, ncaa, </keywords><start-date>1461859200000</start-date><display-name>NCAA Athletics</display-name><path>/2016/04/athletics-faq</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/athletics-faq</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1461874961303</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463086321589</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz offers undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in club sports, as well as NCAA Division III intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<p>There are 49 competitive and noncompetitive club sports teams, including baseball, rugby, and badminton.</p>
<p>In Division III intercollegiate athletics, UC Santa Cruz has teams in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s basketball, cross-country, soccer, swimming/diving, tennis, and volleyball; and women&#8217;s golf and track. The program was established in 1980.</p>
<h3 id="whatamp;#8217;shappeningwithintercollegiateathleticsatucsantacruz">What&#8217;s happening with intercollegiate athletics at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Driven by budget pressures, the intercollegiate athletics program is at a crossroads at UC Santa Cruz. The sustainability of the $1.8 million program has been a question for five years.</p>
<p>In May, undergraduate students will vote in an opinion poll that will help offer a more refined picture of the level of student support and help determine the future of NCAA Division III athletics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>If more than 50 percent of voting students wish to see the program continue, a fee proposal will be brought to students in spring 2017.</p>
<p>If there isn&#8217;t sufficient support for continuing the athletics program, the campus provost/executive vice chancellor has indicated her willingness to close the program the following year.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a vote on a fee in spring 2017 and it passes, the campus will help transition NCAA athletics to a revenue model based on student fees. If the fee does not pass, the campus provost/executive vice chancellor has indicated her willingness to closing the program the following year.</p>
<p>Even if the Division III program ends, students will still be able to participate in club sports.</p>
<h3 id="whenistheelectionwhenwilltheresultsbeknown">When is the election? When will the results be known?</h3>
<p><a href="elections.ucsc.edu">Voting</a> begins May 11 and continues through May 17. The chancellor will verify the results and announce them by May 27.</p>
<h3 id="didnamp;#8217;tstudentsalreadyvoteonafeerelatedtoathletics">Didn&#8217;t students already vote on a fee related to athletics?</h3>
<p>Students voted in spring 2015 against a $117 per quarter fee that would have provided funding for the operation of intercollegiate athletics. A total of 5,778 votes were cast with 60 percent against the measure.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz currently has a $5 per quarter student fee, enacted in 2007, that supports intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<h3 id="isnamp;#8217;t1.8millionatinyfractionoftheoverallcampusbudget">Isn&#8217;t $1.8 million a tiny fraction of the overall campus budget?</h3>
<p>In the face of declining state support for University of California, UC Santa Cruz has been forced to make difficult choices for the past several years. This is one of them.</p>
<p>The campus has had to cut more than $65 million from its core operating budget since 2007&#8211;08. The campus must remain focused on its mission of education and research.</p>
<h3 id="doothercampuseshavestudentfeessupportingathletics">Do other campuses have student fees supporting athletics?</h3>
<p>Yes, many other universities and UC campuses have student fees that help offset the cost of an intercollegiate athletics program as well as the costs associated with many other student programs and facilities.</p>
<p>UC Merced, which competes in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, charges $75 per semester. UC Irvine has a $99 annual fee to support Division I athletics and other campus spirit programs.</p>
<h3 id="howmanystudentsparticipateinathleticsatucsantacruz">How many students participate in athletics at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Approximately 280 students, or less than 2 percent of undergraduates, participate in the NCAA program. About 900 students, or 5.5 percent of undergraduates, play club sports. Roughly 4,000 students, or 23 percent of the total student body, take part in the recreational opportunities offered through OPERS at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3 id="whatisncaadivisioniii">What is NCAA Division III?</h3>
<p>More than 170,000 student-athletes at 444 institutions make up Division III, the largest NCAA division both in number of participants and number of schools.</p>
<p>No athletics scholarships are allowed in Division III. However, as with all U.S. students, student-athletes are able to apply for financial aid through the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office using a need-based application process.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

artist Xiang Silou in <em><strong>The Eternal Line: Ordinary Stories</strong></em>--an exhibition running through May 7 at the Porter Faculty Gallery on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
 <br/>
 A professor at the Fine Arts Institute of Sichuan Normal University in Chengdu, Sichuan, where he researches and creates his remarkable black-and-white woodblock prints, Silou is the first visiting artist at UCSC&#8217;s new Contemporary Print Media Research Center. This will be his first solo exhibition on the West Coast.<br/>
 <br/>
 As part of a month-long residency on campus, Silou is also working on woodblock prints in the center&#8217;s newly created visiting artist studio, where UCSC students are participating in his project and workshops. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;When I first saw Xiang Silou&#8217;s art in a solo exhibition at the Guanlan Original Printmaking Base in China while I was on a residency there in 2012, I was struck by the extraordinary richness of his large woodblock prints,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz art professor Jimin Lee. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;His meticulous, intricate, delicate hand-carved work, which he creates and prints himself, is inspired by the people and landscapes of his native Southwest China,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It represents an art form believed to go back a thousand years.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Silou is known for his large-scale, intricately detailed portraits of faces, particularly of elderly people from ethnic minorities of China. <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;His images, I believe, provide a deep understanding of Southwest Chinese&#8217;s social and cultural identity and diversity,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;They exemplify how particular everyday moments or scenes that an artist experiences can be transformed into tactile, tangible printed images. I am very excited that the UCSC community can now see Xiang Silou&#8217;s incredible prints up close at the faculty gallery.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The <a href="http://printmedia.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Contemporary Print Media Research Center</strong></em></a> is one of several research centers in the Baskin Art Department. Through its new visiting artist program, UC Santa Cruz students will be able to interact and participate in each visiting artist&#8217;s projects.<br/>
 <br/>
 Lee said that the center will continue to bring in visiting artists from different cultural and social backgrounds to benefit UCSC art students.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;By participating in the professional practice of artistic and scholarly research, students will acquire unique working practices and knowledge of diverse skill sets,&#8221; said Lee, &#8220;while also gaining cultural exposure to the unique individuals selected to participate in the program.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham noted that Silou spoke to a packed audience of students, faculty and community members at the gallery last night about his creative process.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This exhibition provides a great opportunity for alumni to visit Porter College over the weekend to see these spectacular hand-printed woodblock portraits,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;At the same time, they can also check out the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/faculty-art-exhibition.html"><em><strong>Art Department&#8217;s faculty exhibition</strong></em></a> now up in the Sesnon Gallery,&#8221; she added.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="635074a58072701713dacb13992f32ab"><name>beyond-compliance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>“Beyond Compliance” Town Hall, May 10, 4–6 p.m., Stevenson Event Center</title><summary>Please join us for a dialogue on sexual harassment and sexual violence that will bring together Academic Senate leaders, students, faculty members, and staff. </summary><start-date>1461913200000</start-date><display-name>“Beyond Compliance” Town Hall, May 10, 4–6 p.m., Stevenson Event Center</display-name><path>/2016/04/beyond-compliance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/beyond-compliance</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1461955096222</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1461962918174</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As I mentioned <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html">in a campus message</a> a few weeks ago, I am convening the campus community to initiate a dialogue on sexual harassment and sexual violence that will bring together Academic Senate leaders, students, faculty members, and staff.

 I ask that you <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond/">RSVP to the event</a> so that we can plan accordingly. You may also submit anonymous ideas and suggestions for ground rules at <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond/">the same website</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 Your reactions and feedback to my message have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive of this effort, so I feel the pressure to make sure we have a constructive conversation that yields meaningful actions. These actions will set the ethical bar for our administrators and faculty to follow, and even surpass, as leaders in changing the culture within higher education.<br/>
 <br/>
 I have also heard your stories of disappointment and distress. Hearing about these experiences has been heartbreaking, to say the least.&#160; As President Janet Napolitano recently told the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> editorial board, we should all expect to be able to be a part of the UC Santa Cruz community without the fear of being sexually harassed or assaulted. It takes all of us to be aware of this behavior and take the appropriate actions that communicate that this is simply unacceptable.<br/>
 <br/>
 The forum on May 10 will be moderated by Nancy Heishman, director of Campus Conflict Resolution Services. I will be joined by colleagues from the Academic Senate, Title IX office, CARE office, and other campus leaders who are committed to advancing this culture of change. We are all looking forward to hearing your ideas on how we can make this cultural shift.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you are unable to attend this event, but would like to contribute to the conversation, we welcome your thoughts in advance at <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond/">http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond/</a>. Your submissions can be anonymous.<br/>
 <br/>
 If at anytime during the event, you feel that you need immediate support, the <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/">CARE office staff</a> will be available at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge.<br/>

<p>With the clock ticking for 24 hours, Giving Day will showcase more than 50 projects all across campus. Students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends are reaching out to invite prospective donors to support favorite projects during this concentrated online fundraising drive.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://givingday.ucsc.edu/?utm_campaign=givingday2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=04-22-2016&amp;utm_content=giving-day-link"><strong>givingday.ucsc.edu</strong></a> site will go live at 12:01 a.m. on May 11 for donors to make gifts. Before then, visitors to the site can preview the featured projects, which range from a research program that weighs elephant seal pups to a poetry-writing workshop for students. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving Day highlights the importance of philanthropy to the future of the university,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;On behalf of our students and campus, we invite our alumni and friends the world over to join us on May 11.&#8221;</p>
<p>Videos, social media, an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1699859590272167/?active_tab=highlights"><strong>event page on Facebook</strong></a>, and the hashtag #gameonucsc are among the tools project teams will be using to spread the word about Giving Day. &#160;</p>
<p>Incentives to give on May 11 include matching funds provided by supporters of the Quarry Amphitheater, Girls in Engineering, <em>Hermanas Unidas,</em> the Dickens Project, and other projects and programs.</p>
<p>Follow the action on May 11 at <a href="http://givingday.ucsc.edu/?utm_campaign=givingday2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=04-22-2016&amp;utm_content=giving-day-link"><strong>givingday.ucsc.edu</strong></a><strong>,</strong> where gifts will be tallied in real time and matching-fund challenges will be posted. The site will also showcase donor news and pop-up events taking place on campus and in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving Day is a great way to make philanthropy fun and participatory to a wider audience,&#8221; said Keith Brant, vice chancellor for University Relations. &#8220;Donors are increasingly giving online and relying on social media to share their messages. This seems like the right time for us embrace that trend in a bigger way at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Giving Day, online donors can support any campus fund they choose, whether or not it is a featured project. Gifts can also be made in person, by phone, or by check. For more information call 831.459.2489 or email <a href="mailto:givingday@ucsc.edu">givingday@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>All Giving Day gifts support the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>

Photo by Steve Kurtz.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Hundreds of UC Santa Cruz alumni went back to school last weekend, but without all-night study binges, exams or career counselors standing by.</p>
<p>There was no stress, no cramming, just good conversation, selfies with Sammy the Slug, fascinating lectures and reminiscing on green fields overlooking the Monterey Bay. Returning Slugs sat down to an al fresco lunch of mesquite-grilled chicken thighs and kale-chicory-cranberry salad while a vivacious five-part, old-time music group called the Coffee Zombie Collective performed acoustic cover versions of Modest Mouse, Radiohead, Foster the People, Prince, and Sir Mix-a-Lot songs.</p>
<p>While most of the action took place on campus, jazz singer Kim Nalley rocked a capacity crowd at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz after taking part in a presentation about global jazz history as it relates to art and culture, along with UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean Tyler Stovall, and UC Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter.</p>
<p>In other words, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Alumni Weekend festivities reflected the eclecticism and adventurous learning that first put this campus on the educational map more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>A quiet &#8220;sit spot&#8221; in the woods</strong></p>
<p>While the schedule was packed with offerings, there were also quiet moments to admire the natural beauty of the campus while silently stalking towhees, finches, and woodpeckers during a well-attended birding expedition, or think about days gone by while nursing a glass of carrot cake-flavored ale at a wine reception.</p>
<p>At an early morning bird-watching event on Saturday, Ivan Millan (Crown, &#8217;10, neuroscience) and Andrea Herrera, (Crown, &#8217;10, anthropology) reflected on how the campus farm used to be their favorite &#8220;sit spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We met here,&#8221; Millan explained. &#8220;And we&#8217;re still a couple. We used to come up to the farm to think about life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herrera&#8217;s designated &#8220;sit spot&#8221; was a lovely old redwood tree, canting at an angle, and heavily pockmarked with a family of woodpecker&#8217;s acorn-storage holes. &#8220;I used to close my eyes and listen to the sounds all around me,&#8217;&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>Those times up there on the farm were transformative, and so was Millan&#8217;s experience in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Academic Excellence Program (ACE). This academic support program is dedicated to increasing the diversity of UCSC students earning bachelors' degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before (ACE), I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do,&#8221; Millan said. &#8220;I felt so encouraged by that program.&#8221;</p>
<p>That same day, ACE held a ceremony marking 30 years of academic support for STEM students.</p>
<p><strong>Looking back with Elliot Aronson</strong></p>
<p>Revelers had all kinds of opportunities to raise their spirits and stimulate their brains. One of the most well-attended events was a &#8220;Teach-In&#8221; with the&#160;legendary social psychologist Elliot Aronson, who reflected on a 55-year career to a more than capacity crowd of attendants, some of them standing outside the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Aronson, widely considered one of the most influential and eminent psychologists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, is known for his studies of cognitive dissonance, the mental gymnastics that the mind will undertake for the sake of self-justification, whether we&#8217;re being hazed in a fraternity or explaining away some messy action that doesn&#8217;t fit neatly into the way we view ourselves.</p>
<p>While some of Aronson&#8217;s work has exposed human foibles, some of his other work has eased racial tensions in schools through a &#8216;jigsaw classroom&#8217; program and increased political engagement among underrepresented groups.&#160;For instance, Aronson spoke of his involvement in the 2012 presidential election. There was concern over Republican efforts to suppress the black vote, and a friend asked him if he could help.</p>
<p>Aronson was interested in helping people get to the polls and so he conducted an experiment in swing states. He and his cohorts approached black ministers to tell their congregations that their ancestors had fought and died to gain the right to vote &#8220;so don&#8217;t (squander the opportunity.)&#8221;</p>
<p>The ministers asked members of their congregations to call three friends and &#8220;tell them, &#8216;you are voting, and if I can do it, you can do it.&#8221;&#8217; Then they told them to have each of those friends call three friends with the same message.&#160;</p>
<p>"We did this only in the swing states,&#8221; Aronson said. &#8220;In every single state where we worked there was an increase in African American voting that year.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way, Aronson has deep roots on campus; he is an emeritus psychology professor here; his four children all attended UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>A mammoth conundrum</strong></p>
<p>At the same time as Aronson&#8217;s lecture, professor Beth Shapiro, who jointly runs the UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Lab and teaches in the Physical and Biological Sciences Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department, delivered a riveting lecture called &#8220;How To Clone a Woolly Mammoth,&#8221; a cautionary talk regarding the ethical murkiness and scientific improbability of such a venture.</p>
<p>Among other things, Shapiro pondered the wisdom of raising a mammoth in captivity in a world that has not yet figured out how to keep elephants happily in captivity. While acknowledging that the reintroduction of mammoths could restore the ecological health of tundras, she said that many non-extinct &#8220;super-grazer&#8221; animals could do just as good a job at turning the soil over and moving seeds back and forth to reinvigorate those ecosystems.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>A bold artistic statement</strong></p>
<p>One of the quiet highlights was an intimate discussion between the author Lawrence Weschler (Cowell, &#8217;74) and a much buzzed-about new artist named Ramiro Gomez, whose artwork includes exactingly executed depictions of mansions and the manicured hedges of the wealthy, with wraithlike and often faceless images of underpaid janitors, nannies, and garden crews waiting on the sidelines.&#160;One of Gomez&#8217;s much-publicized &#8220;guerilla&#8221; art projects involved the placing of cardboard cut outs of domestic workers at the gates of Los Angeles-area mansions.</p>
<p>Gomez, whose social consciousness comes, in part, from his experience as a Los Angeles-area nanny, says that some of his works are &#8220;a kind of diary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of art serving as a kind of diary, the celebrated professor emeritus of American Studies and founding UC Santa Cruz faculty member John Dizikes used poems by W.H. Auden, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Marianne Moore, and Langston Hughes to reflect on how learning works and also explore his development as an educator.</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose those poems because I have read them for years,&#8221; &#160;Dizikes explained before his talk. &#8220;They spoke to me about my life in teaching and learning, I am deeply moved by them, and they meant more and more to me as I did more teaching and got older.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dizikes joined Weschler and psychology professor Steve Whittaker, literature professor Jody Greene and dance professor Edward &#8220;Ted&#8221; Warburton in his discussion about learning.</p>
<p><strong>Steeped in philosophy</strong></p>
<p>In some of the presentations, returning alumni had a chance to hear the stories of successful Slugs whose UC Santa Cruz roots informed some of their life choices and even their business practices. One dramatic example &#160;is Blue Bottle Coffee founder James Freeman (Stevenson '90, philosophy) who had an informal but eye-opening talk with UCSC philosophy chair and associate professor Daniel Guevara.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that Freeman, who took part in the True Originals series highlighting distinguished alumni, is the most philosophical coffee maven of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. He has spent most of his life, in the words of Guevara, seeking &#8220;something quotidian in the everyday.&#8221;</p>
<p>After devoting himself passionately to a career as a professional clarinet player, with mounting frustration and diminishing returns, he switched to coffee; attempting to perfect a cup of coffee was &#8220;actually less daunting&#8217;&#8217; than performing music. &#8220;I could still profoundly dedicate myself to this pursuit but there was less pressure.&#8221; Even if things didn&#8217;t go a well as he hoped they would, &#8220;At least I wouldn&#8217;t be disappointing Johann Sebastian Bach.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Freeman is unstinting about quality, he has steered clear of what he calls &#8220;the MBA perfectionist thing&#8221; by following his passion for &#8220;delicious things&#8221; while acknowledging &#8220;the imperfectabilty of what we do. There are people who will say &#8216;here is the solution, here is the spreadsheet,&#8217; and all we have to do is this thing on the spreadsheet. But Carlos Nore&#241;a (one of Freeman&#8217;s professors) once said the world is so much more complicated than anything we can say about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Gaming the system</strong></p>
<p>Freeman&#8217;s talk was all about following your passion. Two other True Original presenters, the computer game designers Akira Thompson (M.S. &#8217;15, games and playable media)&#160; and Lauren Scott (Porter &#8216;14, business management economics/computer science)&#160;also shared stories about pursuing their visions.</p>
<p>Thompson helms his own independent game company and has been drawing attention for &amp;maybetheywontkillyou, a live game in which the player takes on the role of a poor black American attempting to go to the corner store down the street and return home safely without getting harassed or even killed by police.</p>
<p>&#160;He urged budding game designers with skeptical parents to have them re-consider their &#8220;strict definitions of games. Show them the breadth of what games can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He founded the social art creative firm RainBros, which developed a game with socio-political overtones called &#8220;Stop! Thief!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lauren Scott, who appeared alongside Thompson, is part of the new wave of button-pushing female video game designers. After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, she went to work at Zynga as an associate game designer. After a year there, she went to work at Hangar 13, a 2K Games studio, where she is working on&#160;<em>Mafia 3</em>, a &#8220;third-person shooter&#8221; game with an organized crime theme.</p>
<p>She advised budding game designers to &#8220;start small,&#8221; and take meaningful steps, rather than launch immediately into their big &#8220;magnum opus&#8221; and run the risk of &#8220;falling short, getting frustrated and falling out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also urged female game designers to pay it forward in a male dominated industry by serving as resources and role models. &#8220;You have to hold the torch,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;If someone does it for you, look behind you and see who you can bring up with you.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d2a1cc788072701764c820a6a6c2e3bd"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2016/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/04/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1459527732316</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477419646288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
