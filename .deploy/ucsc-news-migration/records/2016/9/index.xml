The device she used is based on nanopore sequencing technology developed by researchers at UC Santa Cruz in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>"The fundamental research and patents underlying the technology of nanopore sequencing were carried out here at UCSC," said David Deamer, research professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>UCSC's nanopore technology was licensed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies of Oxford, U.K., which subsequently developed the MinION sequencing device used on the International Space Station. The device, which analyzes DNA molecules as they pass through a tiny pore (a "nanopore"), is compact and portable. It fits in the palm of a hand and plugs into the USB port of a laptop or tablet.</p>
<p>"This is a wondrous technical achievement by Oxford Nanopore and NASA. I am proud of UCSC's key role in helping build the foundation that made it possible," said Mark Akeson, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Deamer first came up with the idea for nanopore sequencing in 1989 when he was at UC Davis. At UC Santa Cruz, he and Akeson established the nanopore research group in 1996, making important advances in nanopore sequencing technology in the subsequent decades. They both serve on Oxford Nanopore's technology advisory board.</p>
<p>"Nanopore sequencing is an ideal example of how academic scientists can collaborate with businesses to develop new instruments with unprecedented capabilities," Deamer said. "Clive Brown, who led the development of the MinION at Oxford, suggested that it will make possible an internet of living things. That sounds right to me."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Important tool</strong></p>
<p>According to NASA, the ability to sequence DNA in space could enable astronauts to diagnose an illness, or identify microbes growing in the International Space Station and determine whether or not they represent a health threat. A space-based DNA sequencer would be an important tool to help protect astronaut health during long-duration missions on the journey to Mars, and future explorers could also potentially use the technology to identify DNA-based life forms beyond Earth.</p>
<p>NASA's Biomolecule Sequencer investigation sent samples of mouse, virus, and bacteria DNA to the space station to test the MinION DNA sequencing device. Rubins, who has a background in molecular biology, conducted the test aboard the station while researchers simultaneously sequenced identical samples on the ground. The tests were set up to attempt to make spaceflight conditions, primarily microgravity, the only variables that could account for differences in results. For example, the samples were prepared on the ground for sequencing, and researchers selected organisms whose DNA has already been completely sequenced so that they knew what results to expect.</p>
<p>As the researchers compare results from the sequences collected in microgravity and on Earth, so far everything seems to match up, according to a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/dna_sequencing">NASA press release</a>. &#8220;A next step is to test the entire process in space, including sample preparation as well as performing the sequencing,&#8221; said project manager and NASA microbiologist Sarah Castro-Wallace. Then astronauts can move beyond creating a known DNA sequence and actually extract, prepare and sequence DNA to identify unknown microbes on orbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onboard sequencing makes it possible for the crew to know what is in their environment at any time,&#8221; Castro-Wallace said. &#8220;That allows us on the ground to take appropriate action &#8211; do we need to clean this up right away, or will taking antibiotics help or not? We can resupply the station with disinfectants and antibiotics now, but once crews move beyond the station&#8217;s low Earth orbit, we need to know when to save those precious resources and when to use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the sequencer can become a tool for other science investigations aboard the station. For example, researchers could use it to examine changes in genetic material or gene expression in orbit rather than waiting for the samples to return to Earth for testing.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbEJHuX1u60&amp;list=PLCBOHrgOAA_vKv45Q5mLqs0hJwoUVYMN_&amp;index=18</url><title>UCSC Video: Sequence DNA Anywhere</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/nanopore-sequencer.html</url><title>New DNA sequencer uses nanopore concepts pioneered at UCSC</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/XWdkZhYqMgo?list=PL8F7BC3F1240213F5</url><title>NASA Video: Sequencing DNA in Space</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/dna_sequencing</url><title>NASA: First DNA sequencing in space a game changer</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ec94553c8072701713dacb137d594501"><name>green-colleges</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz highlighted in Green College Honor Roll</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz scored 99 points—the most possible—in a listing meant to provide a comprehensive measure of a school's performance as an environmentally aware and prepared institution. </summary><keywords>green, sustainability, princeton</keywords><start-date>1472832000000</start-date><display-name>Sustainability ranking</display-name><path>/2016/09/green-colleges</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/green-colleges</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1472847957944</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1473799439301</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/green-college-400px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/green-college-400px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>green-college-400px.jpeg</name><display-name>green-college-400px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>57615</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Beets</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/green-college-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/green-college-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>green-college-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>green-college-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>5354</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Beets</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Green Colleges Honor Roll aims to provide a comprehensive measure of a school&#8217;s performance as an environmentally aware and prepared institution.

<p>The <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/1023551/college/university-california--santa-cruz">listing cites</a> UC Santa Cruz for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, &#8216;greening&#8217; design and construction projects on campus, and integrating sustainability at every level.</p>
<p>The campus <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu">Sustainability Office</a> has a <a href="http://projectclearinghouse.ucsc.edu">database</a> of project ideas submitted by students, faculty, and staff to improve sustainable practices. Students can also apply for grants to pursue initiatives that reduce carbon emissions on campus.</p>
<p>This rating, on a scale of 60&#8211;99, provides a comprehensive measure of a school&#8217;s performance as an environmentally aware and prepared institution. Specifically, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether students have a campus quality of life that is both healthy and sustainable,</li>
<li>how well a school is preparing students for employment in the clean-energy economy of the 21st century as well as for citizenship in a world now defined by environmental concerns and opportunities and,</li>
<li>how environmentally responsible a school&#8217;s policies are.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Princeton Review wrote that it assembled a panel of experts in higher education green practices to produce a survey for school administrators. The panel then selected key questions and weighted them for the rating. Nearly all 4-year colleges and universities were invited to participate early in the year.</p>
<p>The honor roll does not rank the colleges but calls out the 21 with the highest possible scores.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranks No. 32 in Princeton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-green-colleges&amp;page=2">Top 50 Green Colleges</a> listing. It is one of four UCs on the list.</p>
<p>UC&#8217;s Policy on Sustainable Practices guides campuses in nine areas: green building, clean energy, sustainable transportation, climate protection, sustainable operations, waste reduction and recycling, environmentally preferable purchasing, sustainable foodservice, and sustainable water systems.</p>
<p>UC President Janet Napolitano has called for UC to achieve complete carbon neutrality by 2025.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ecd6e7078072701713dacb134c8ab7c1"><name>edwards-kalimba</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Football, farming, and food security</title><summary>Former NFL star defensive end Kalimba Edwards is on an ambitious mission: He hopes to one day create a self-sustaining food system that can feed the nation’s hungry and homeless.</summary><start-date>1472852100000</start-date><display-name>Kalimba Edwards, Farm apprentice</display-name><path>/2016/09/edwards-kalimba</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/edwards-kalimba</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1472852320655</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1472858675355</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/kalimba-5-520.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/kalimba-5-520.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kalimba-5-520.jpg</name><display-name>kalimba-5-520.jpg</display-name><file-size>470009</file-size><width>520</width><height>741</height></image><image-alt>kalimba edwards</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/kalimba-cart-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/kalimba-cart-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kalimba-cart-80.jpg</name><display-name>kalimba-cart-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22704</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>kalimba edwards</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Former NFL defensive end Kalimba Edwards traded a mansion for a tent cabin on the UC Santa Cruz Farm where he is an apprentice in the ecologial horticulture program.

<p>&#8220;But first I have to learn how to grow the food,&#8221; says Edwards, 36, who had never farmed in his life until he arrived at the 30-acre teaching farm at UC Santa Cruz earlier this spring.</p>
<p>Edwards played six seasons with the Detroit Lions before signing a two-year contract with the Oakland Raiders in 2008. At six-foot-six and 265 pounds, he played in 101 NFL games and is credited with 165 tackles and 31 sacks.</p>
<p>Today, he is an apprentice at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) ecological horticulture program, an immersive six-month curriculum that trains future organic farmers, gardeners, teachers, and community leaders in environmentally and socially responsible farming methods.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship program began at UC Santa Cruz in 1967 with <a href="http://www.alan-chadwick.org/html%20pages/gallery/ucsc_garden_today.html">English master gardener Alan Chadwick</a> and is beginning celebrations to mark its 50th year.</p>
<p>Enrolling at the ecological horticulture program is part of a new life journey for Edwards that began when his professional football career ended in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Back to his roots</strong></p>
<p>Edwards had just retired from the Oakland Raiders&#160;and was back home in Georgia when he experienced overpowering memories of his great grandmother. She passed away when he was in middle school and he says he was too young to appreciate how much she did for the community.</p>
<p>He had flashbacks of her funeral, an event where the whole town flooded the local church to pay their final respects. He remembered summers with her, eating only rice with ketchup. He remembered carrying heavy grocery bags home on the bus and preparing meals to feed hungry neighbors in need. Food and community was a recurring theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;She just gave and gave and gave,&#8221; Edwards says. &#8220;My great grandmother owned nothing.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Realizing how this one woman impacted so many lives made Edwards feel as though there was more than the fast cars, big houses, and expensive jewelry that defined his life after he turned pro.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had so much stuff,&#8221; Edwards remembers. &#8220;I was in a selfish mode when I retired from football.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards felt an overwhelming desire to do more. Lenny Williams, his best friend and former teammate on the University of South Carolina&#8217;s football team, encouraged Edwards to help him feed the homeless. Williams was working at a hotel at the time and would bring extra food and leftovers into the homeless community in Atlanta.</p>
<p>&#8220;I woke back up,&#8221; Edwards says.</p>
<p>With Williams, Edwards began regularly feeding the homeless. He wanted them to have hot, home-cooked meals like his great grandmother had made. So he and Williams would prepare mashed potatoes, collard greens, and beans with organic ingredients sourced from their local health food stores. They would make trays of macaroni and cheese. Edwards also bought socks, blankets, and other things that the homeless said they needed.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual and material transformation</strong></p>
<p>But Edwards&#8217; boldest move was when he decided to give away all his possessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walked away from it all,&#8221; Edwards says. He sold his jewelry and cars and donated the proceeds to charity. &#8220;People thought I was crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has never looked back.</p>
<p>Edwards moved into a small apartment in the same town where his great grandmother had once lived. He devoted his time to religion, spirituality, and his community.</p>
<p>&#8220;One religion led to another religion,&#8221; Edwards said. He reread the Bible, the scriptures, and the New Testament. He studied Hebrew. He picked up the Quran and the Bhagavad Gita. He dipped into Buddhist philosophy and went on week-long meditation retreats. In addition to preparing meals for the homeless, he mentored drug addicts at the local jail.</p>
<p>He learned about herbs, healing, and alternative medicines. He became a vegan.</p>
<p>But he soon realized that he did not know how to even grow the food and herbs he depended on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a slave to the system,&#8221; says Edwards. He thought he should know how to become self-sufficient and start his own organic, seasonal farm that could feed his community&#8217;s homeless population. He came to the CASFS apprenticeship program to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Farming and food security</strong></p>
<p>Now the former football star is poised to do something bigger: &#8220;What if you could develop not a farm but an entire ecological system that could produce food all year round,&#8221; he asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;CASFS changed my vision,&#8221; says Edwards, who is deeply concerned about food security and sustainability. He sees a future in perennial farming and permaculture that he learned from fellow apprentices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned as much from the other apprentices as I have my teachers,&#8221; he says. &#160;</p>
<p>He plans to continue his agricultural education with courses in soil biology and permaculture, and spend several years working in an agroforestry system.</p>
<p>Edwards hopes to develop his own sustainable food system with trees, shrubs, and bushes that can sustain communities year-round, and not end when the growing season is over.</p>

<p>Principal investigator Roberto Manduchi, a professor of computer engineering at UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, said the project addresses the needs of a large community of people who rely on public transportation for independent mobility, yet face serious difficulties in using it.</p>
<p>"For someone with poor vision or blindness, or with some level of cognitive impairment, and for many senior citizens, taking a bus on an unfamiliar route can be a real challenge and a source of anxiety," Manduchi said. "Our system could make public transit easier to use for everybody."</p>
<p>Difficulties in using public transit often involve access to the relevant information, such as which bus to get on, which platform to wait on for a train, when to exit the bus or train, and how to negotiate a transfer. Manduchi's team will develop and test a system called RouteMe2 that will provide users with continuous, context-aware information, notifications, and warnings designed to guide them through their trip from start to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud service</strong></p>
<p>The RouteMe2 service will be based on an extensive infrastructure that includes miniaturized transmitters (called iBeacons) placed inside buses and trains and at bus stops, train platforms, and transit hubs; sensors in the user's smartphone; and a cloud service that receives data from the user's smartphone and from transit agencies.</p>
<p>The user, or an authorized person such as a family member or caretaker, can register a trip in advance using an online system similar to familiar trip schedulers such as Google Maps. During the trip, the passenger receives information to help ensure that they are waiting at the right location, entering the right bus or train, and exiting at the right stop. Meanwhile, an authorized family member or assistant can monitor the trip remotely and receive warnings if an unexpected situation arises.</p>
<p>Manduchi has worked on a variety of research projects to develop assistive technologies for people with disabilities. For this project, he will be working with colleagues in several different departments at UC Santa Cruz. Computer scientist Ethan Miller, the Symantec Professor of Storage and Security, will lead the development of cloud services for RouteMe2. Sri Kurniawan, professor of computational media and computer engineering, is an expert on human-computer interaction and will lead the design of an accessible interface and conduct focus groups and user studies. Adam Millard-Ball, assistant professor of environmental studies, is an expert on transportation policy and will provide input based on his experience in transportation planning.</p>
<p>"Public transportation along the Central Coast is a vital link for connecting people to school, jobs, health care, family and friends, restaurants, shops, and so much more," said Congressman Sam Farr. "This federal research grant from the National Science Foundation will explore how to expand access to public transportation, especially for the disabled and senior citizen communities, which will make the Central Coast more livable. UCSC has long served our community with important research and I&#8217;m thrilled to see federal funding headed to UCSC."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Regional partners</strong></p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team will be working with several regional partners to develop and test the service. To get input from potential users of the system, the researchers will work with the Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired in Palo Alto. The team is partnering with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) to deploy the iBeacon transmitters on buses and at bus stops, and Manduchi has been in touch with Caltrain in regard to deploying transmitters at train platforms and on trains.</p>
<p>IBM Research will serve as the principal industrial partner for the project. Lead researcher Divyesh Jadav and his team from the IBM Research - Almaden in San Jose will bring expertise in cloud computing, systems analytics, and the internet of things. They will help design an iBeacon-based test bed infrastructure and a cloud back-end analytics system for RouteMe2. IBM will also provide the team access to its Watson cloud developer platform on BlueMix.</p>
<p>"The confluence of mobile, cloud, and the internet of things has made possible unique advances for travel and transportation," Jadav said. "We're pleased to help develop new cognitive assistance capabilities while setting a solid example of how public-private partnerships can address such large-scale societal challenges."</p>
<p>The RouteMe2 project builds on Manduchi's previous work on a Personal Travel Assistant, funded by the Transportation Research Board, which showed that accessible transit-related information can be extremely helpful for blind passengers using the bus system. Manduchi said the RouteMe2 service will be based on a more complex infrastructure to provide more functionalities for a wide range of users. Although the research test bed will not be available for general use, he is hopeful that it will lead to the eventual implementation of such a service.</p>
<p>"This is a technical research project, but it addresses important issues," he said. "We want to make public transportation more accessible for everybody."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0025103f8072701713dacb130f66ae99"><name>cool-schools</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz among greenest universities in Sierra Club ranking</title><summary>Coming in at No. 18, the ranking underscored UC Santa Cruz’s strong commitment to protecting the environment, addressing climate change, and encouraging sustainability.</summary><start-date>1473174000000</start-date><display-name>Sustainability</display-name><path>/2016/09/cool-schools</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/cool-schools</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1473176210072</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1473984402947</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value><value>Feature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/cool-schools-400px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/cool-schools-400px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>cool-schools-400px.jpeg</name><display-name>cool-schools-400px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>71155</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz was No. 18 in Sierra magazine's "Cool Schools" ranking</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/cool-schools-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/cool-schools-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cool-schools-80px.jpg</name><display-name>cool-schools-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>4837</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz was No. 18 in Sierra magazine's "Cool Schools" ranking</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz was No. 18 in Sierra magazine's "Cool Schools" ranking.&#160; (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/cool-school-logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/cool-school-logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cool-school-logo.jpg</name><display-name>cool-school-logo.jpg</display-name><file-size>46056</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is one of the 20 greenest colleges in the country, according to the <em>Sierra</em> magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/cool-schools-2016/top-20">&#8220;Cool Schools&#8221; ranking</a>.</p>
<p><em>Sierra</em> magazine, the national magazine of the Sierra Club, today released its 10th annual &#8220;Cool Schools&#8221; ranking of America&#8217;s greenest colleges and universities. UC Santa Cruz is one of three UCs to be in the top 20.</p>
<p>Coming in at No. 18, the ranking underscored UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s strong commitment to protecting the environment, addressing climate change, and encouraging sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has been an innovator in many areas of sustainability for several years, most notably in academic programs, social justice, food, transportation, and water conservation,&#8221; said Sustainability Director Elida Erickson. &#8220;The fact that UC Santa Cruz ranks within the Top 20 in an increasingly competitive field of up-and-coming institutions speaks strongly to the ongoing commitment of our students, faculty, staff, and campus administrators to the values of sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 200 schools participated in <em>Sierra&#8217;s</em> extensive survey about sustainability practices on their campus. Using an updated, customized scoring system, Sierra&#8217;s researchers ranked each university based on its demonstrated commitment to upholding high environmental standards.</p>
<p><em>Sierra</em> magazine wrote, "Thanks in part to a group called Students for Organic Solutions, 33 percent of UCSC&#8217;s cafeteria budget goes toward organic ingredients that were produced no farther than 250 miles from Santa Cruz, including from the university&#8217;s own 30-acre farm, where students learn how to grow pesticide-free food.</p>
<p>"The Banana Slugs also run their own bicycle library, and the school reduced its water use by 36 percent between 2005 and 2015.The campus is full of old-growth redwood trees and wild deer, and boasts epic views of the Monterey Bay."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz earned 670 points, with a perfect score in &#8220;Innovation.&#8221; In its report, the campus cited its work toward becoming zero-waste, its participation in the Cool Campus Challenge, its creation of a carbon neutrality roadmap, and the ambitious plan developed by UC Santa Cruz researchers to use the UC Natural Reserve System (NRS) to detect and forecast the ecological impacts of climate change in California.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has marked a number of sustainability achievements recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/kroeker-packard.html">was awarded</a> a $875,000 Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</li>
<li>Andrew Fisher, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences, coauthored <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/groundwater-report.html">comprehensive recommendations</a> for forming Groundwater Sustainability Agencies in California</li>
<li>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/waste-reduction.html">recognized the waste reduction</a> accomplishments of UC Santa Cruz Dining Services, a participant in the EPA&#8217;s Food Recovery Challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;This year is the 10th anniversary of the Cools Schools rankings and we are thrilled by the record number of schools that participated. This huge response shows that colleges are taking the lead on addressing climate change,&#8221; says Jason Mark, <em>Sierra</em>&#8217;s editor in chief. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing schools commit to renewable energy purchasing, buying electric vehicles for their campus fleets, reducing their water usage, offering organic food in the cafeterias and offering dozens of environmental studies courses. These schools are instilling in the minds of their students the importance of adopting conservation values in their day-to-day activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>College of the Atlantic earned the top spot. Other UCs that placed in the top 20 include Irvine (No. 3) and Davis (No. 8).</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so inspired to see the incredible progress that colleges and universities are making when it comes to environmental sustainability,&#8221; says Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. &#8220;Sierra magazine&#8217;s Cool Schools rankings help to recognize those schools that have made sustainability a key part of their mission, and are creating future environmental leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Serial</em> became the most addictive, impactful, and popular American podcast of all time, but the stakes seemed awfully low when UC Santa Cruz graduate Julie Snyder (Kresge '95, politics) and co-creator Sarah Koenig launched it with a first season that investigated the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year-old student at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore.</p>
<p>After all, it was merely a podcast, a relatively low-profile medium until recently. If the show belly-flopped and sank, who would know or care? &#8220;It&#8217;s not like a movie where they need to have this incredible opening weekend, otherwise the whole thing tanks,&#8221; Snyder noted.</p>
<p>Eighty million downloads later, <em>Serial</em> was well-established as a monster hit, sparking passionate debates in cubicles, on street corners, and within the rabbit holes of Reddit, and spawning a peculiar cultural obsession with one of the show&#8217;s sponsors, the email marketing service MailChimp.</p>
<p>Snyder will soon return to UC Santa Cruz, where she is&#160;set to receive the Alumni Achievement Award and give the keynote presentation at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/">Founder&#8217;s Celebration</a> on October 22 at the UC Santa Cruz Science &amp; Engineering Library.</p>
<p>Her trip to campus will be a sort of career homecoming.</p>
<p>Though she&#8217;s a high-profile journalist who produced a podcast that changed the way millions of people think about the American judicial system, Snyder&#8217;s career has its roots in the creative, informal, low-key atmosphere of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s own KZSC-FM, where the &#8220;sink or swim&#8221; format of the daily news show forced her to thrive and improvise&#8212;or else.</p>
<p>Taking a brief break in her busy schedule, Snyder talked about the way she discovered her life&#8217;s calling while at the radio station&#8212;and how she has kept that experimental spirit alive while working for <em>This American Life</em>.</p>
<h3>Flirting with disaster</h3>
<p>The public voice of <em>Serial</em> has always been Sarah Koenig (pronounced Kay-nig), who does the reporting and broadcasting. But Snyder has a decisive behind-the-scenes role. Aside from being the co-creator, she is also the editor and executive producer of <em>Serial</em>.</p>
<p>If Snyder and Koenig had known the world would scrutinize their show with such care, they might have had a bit of creative block. &#8220;I was a little freaked out by the response,&#8221; she concedes. &#8220;It was almost like being caught naked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again, Snyder has plenty of experience with taking risks and following her own best instincts while hoping the audience would follow along with her.</p>
<p>This started at UC Santa Cruz, where she was a broadcaster. On-air mishaps were common.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were flirting with disaster, constantly,&#8221; Snyder recalled. &#8220;At the time, I think we did a 15-minute newscast every night before the hour-long (KPFA-FM) news feed, and it was awful. We basically stole the stories out of the (<em>Santa Cruz</em>) <em>Sentinel,</em> but the fact is, I never thought anyone was listening and it didn&#8217;t even really matter. Then I met someone who said she listened to it all the time because it was really funny. She waited to see when and how we were going to mess it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from showing her that &#8220;the listening audience&#8217;&#8217; was more than just an abstraction, her years on campus opened up the possibilities of storytelling. In a documentary class, she was exposed to the groundbreaking work of The Kitchen Sisters&#8212;innovative public radio producers (and alumnae) Nikki Silva (Porter '73, aesthetic studies) and Davia Nelson (Stevenson '75, politics).</p>
<p>&#8220;They played us their pieces, and that kind of blew my mind,&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;I wanted to see if I could make something that was sort of a rip off of that or try to be as good as that.&#8221;</p>
<h3><em>Serial&#8212;</em>in the beginning</h3>
<p><em>This American Life</em> had been on the air for only six months when Snyder started out there 17 years ago. The show was on 40 stations nationwide. These days, it is on 450 stations. &#8220;It was all very much &#8216;make it up as we went along,&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; Snyder recalls. &#8220;And I was so green. The fact that I didn&#8217;t know what the rules were, or what we were or weren&#8217;t supposed to do, was probably helpful for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Snyder&#8217;s famous boss, Ira Glass, host and creator of <em>This American Life,</em> always had a clear vision of what he wanted the show to be. The show became more topical, more focused on the human element in big news stories, following the 9/11 terror attacks and the wars that followed.</p>
<p>While tackling such heady subjects, Snyder developed her &#8220;voice&#8221; and honed her reporting skills with a strong emphasis on human stories and broadcasts that felt warm and familiar to listeners, with long snippets of conversation.</p>
<p>But she and Koenig opted out of the radio-show format when they decided to launch <em>Serial</em> largely for practical reasons. Creating a public radio show would have required Snyder and Koenig to approach individual member stations, convince them to carry the show, and work it into their broadcast schedules.</p>
<p>By allowing listeners to play the show at will, at any time they wished, the creative team could have an ultra-minimalist approach; considering the show&#8217;s massive impact, it is humbling to realize that only three people were working on the first season: Snyder, Koenig, and producer Dana Chivvis.</p>
<p>The first season explored &#8220;love and death and justice and truth,&#8221; in the words of the show&#8217;s creators, by delving deeply into the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee and the subsequent arrest of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed, who professed his innocence but was handed a life sentence.</p>
<p><em>Serial&#8217;</em>s huge success was cause for celebration, but the deluge of publicity had its downside as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a lot of audience engagement that in some ways was really wonderful; you want to encourage people to discuss all the issues that are brought up in the show,&#8221; Snyder said. But on online Reddit forums and elsewhere, Snyder also learned that &#8220;a small amount of people &#8230; can really wreak a lot of damage&#8221; with &#8220;irresponsible assumptions, name-calling, and outing people&#8217;s personal information &#8230; it just felt disrespectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>For good and not so good, the experience certainly proved that podcasting, once a &#8220;fringe&#8221; form of broadcasting, could resonate in unexpected ways. This summer came the startling news that a Baltimore judge had ordered a new trial for Syed.</p>
<p>Snyder was circumspect when asked about cause and effect. &#8220;People have asked, &#8216;Do you think it is because of the podcast?&#8217; she said. &#8220;When you read the (60-page) ruling, it&#8217;s not like it has anything to do with <em>Seria</em>l. It&#8217;s not like the judge said, &#8216;I found episode seven compelling.&#8217;&#8221; Then again, the <em>Serial</em> podcast created a high level of scrutiny for the case, she acknowledges. &#8220;It totally makes sense that it is probably the result of the public attention on the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the second season, the producers changed focus dramatically, with an in-depth series on Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his Army post in Afghanistan and was taken captive by the Taliban.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>These days, Snyder is hard at work on a new batch of <em>Serial</em> episodes, but it&#8217;s no use asking her for specifics. For the time being, she won&#8217;t even offer teasing hints about the topic at hand.</p>
<p>She is just as cautious if you quiz her about her brand-new non-<em>Serial</em> show. She will only say that the format will be that of an audiobook&#8212;a true-life story told in a novelistic fashion. She would only reveal that all the episodes will be released at once, instead of parceled out one by one like <em>Serial</em>.</p>
<p>Asked if <em>Serial</em> elevated podcasting as a medium, Snyder initially resisted the question. &#8220;&#8216;Elevated&#8217; makes it seem like I&#8217;m too big for my britches,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But maybe (<em>Serial</em>) showed what was possible with podcasting. I love the fact that there is a lot of focus on podcasts and it seems to be taken seriously. There seems to be a lot of funding for podcasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again, the barrier of entry is low for beginning podcasters, Snyder said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people can access it, and it still feels a little Wild West. You can do whatever you want. It still feels experimental. I am curious about what people will explore and experiment with podcasting. I am curious to see it go places.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/review-kzsc.html</url><title>Celebrate the Great 88</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/Julie-Snyder-TO.png</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/Julie-Snyder-TO.png</link><site>news</site><name>Julie-Snyder-TO.png</name><display-name>Julie-Snyder-TO.png</display-name><file-size>72438</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>JULIE SNYDER</title><description>UCSC alumna, who received this year’s Alumni Achievement Award, talks about making the hit podcast Serial and how her college years laid the foundation for a career in broadcast journalism. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="069822718072701713dacb13aefcebae"><name>gage-dayton-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Natural Reserves director Gage Dayton appointed to endowed chair</title><summary>The Wilton W.

Webster Jr. Presidential Chair for the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves provides support for research, teaching, and infrastructure at the reserves</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has appointed Gage Dayton to the Wilton W. Webster Jr. Presidential Chair for the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves. The endowed chair was established in 2015 with a $500,000 gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation and matching funds from the UC Regents.</p>
<p>Dayton, who has served as administrative director of the <a href="http://naturalreserves.ucsc.edu/index.html">UCSC Natural Reserves</a> since 2008, said the funds from the endowed chair will provide critical support for the reserves and the programs that use them.</p>
<p>"As outdoor classrooms and living laboratories, the reserves are the foundation for a wide range of programs for field-based learning and long-term research. This chair was created to help ensure that the reserves are maintained in their natural state for the use of current and future students and faculty," Dayton said. "I feel honored and grateful to the Websters, and I look forward to implementing the vision they had for this chair in a way that has an immediate and lasting impact on UC Santa Cruz and the reserves."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz manages four of the 39 sites in the <a href="http://www.ucnrs.org/">UC Natural Reserve System</a> (NRS), as well as a campus reserve. The UCSC reserves include A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve, Fort Ord Natural Reserve, Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, Younger Lagoon Reserve, and the <a href="http://ucsccampusreserve.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Campus Natural Reserve</a>. The NRS is a unique assemblage of protected wildland sites throughout California encompassing more than 756,000 acres and providing undisturbed environments for research and teaching.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Field-based learning</strong></p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, a growing number of courses and internship programs are getting students out into the reserves for field-based learning and research experience. The support for these programs from the Webster Foundation is helping to ensure that these opportunities are available to a broad range of students from diverse backgrounds, Dayton said.</p>
<p>"The Websters have really supported getting young students from diverse backgrounds out into the field," he said. "The course fees for field courses can be high to cover the costs of travel, camping, and food, and we don't want that to be a barrier for students."</p>
<p>The endowed chair will help fund scholarships and other support for undergraduate and graduate students to use the reserves, as well as providing support for maintenance activities and equipment for the staff who manage the reserves and mentor students.</p>
<p>Dayton earned his B.S. in wildlife management at Humboldt State University and a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>The Wilton W. Webster Jr. Presidential Chair for the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves is the first endowed chair in support of the reserves in the UC system. It is one of eight endowed chairs established at UC Santa Cruz in 2015 through gifts from campus supporters and matching funds from the UC Presidential Endowment Fund. Increasing support for endowed chairs and experiential learning opportunities for students are goals of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which to date has raised more than $248 million in resources for the campus.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz has long had a presence in the Silicon Valley, a 45-minute drive from the main campus. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/silicon-valley-campus-story.html">campus purchased</a> a 90,000 square-foot building in Santa Clara to support its ambitious growth plans for the region.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley Campus is home to a professional master&#8217;s program in Games and Playable Media, and students can also pursue a master&#8217;s degree in Electrical Engineering. New programs in Serious Games and Human-Computer Interaction are planned to launch in 2017 and in 2018, respectively.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley Campus is enabling a stronger connection and greater interaction between faculty, students, and Silicon Valley industry. It is also supporting Silicon Valley-facing research programs and educational, and research partnerships with other UCs and regional universities.</p>
<p>The Bowers Avenue building also houses UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, which for more than 40 years has provided high-quality continuing education and professional development for working professionals in the region. In 2014&#8211;15, UCSC Extension enrolled 18,000 students; 11,000 adult learners and 6,000 middle school and high school students through Scout from the University of California, an online program designed to meet the needs of first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0c083d0e8072701713dacb13b962a8ff"><name>challenging-assumptions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student challenges assumptions about transgender athletes</title><summary>At 19, Chloe Anderson transitioned from male to female.

<p>She&#8217;s also breaking barriers in college athletics, joining the UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s volleyball team as an opposite and an outside hitter.</p>
<p>At 19, Anderson transitioned from male to female. The 24-year-old transfer from Santa Ana College is one of the first transgender athletes to participate in the sport at the NCAA Division III level.</p>
<p>The physical transformation is, in some ways, small in comparison to everything else that has changed about her &#8212; namely that she is happy, embracing rather than retreating from life, pushing herself every day to work toward the ambitious goals she&#8217;s set for herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I decided to come out as transgender, it was the first time I really started to feel good about myself,&#8221; Anderson says.</p>
<p>Before that, Anderson said, &#8220;I had never really experienced being happy. I really was just totally lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an athlete, being transgender poses particular challenges. She has struggled with coordination and muscle weakness as a result of hormone therapy, which she says also makes it harder for her to recover from injury.</p>
<p>She has had to confront the misconception that, as someone born male, she has an unfair physical advantage. In fact, after the hormone treatments, she said, &#8220;I probably have the least testosterone of anyone on the team.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A childhood trying to remain invisible</h3>
<p>Growing up, Anderson didn&#8217;t quite understand what made her different.</p>
<p>As a preschooler, she loved dress up and playing princesses. She had plenty of playmates, most of them girls.</p>
<p>Then shortly before kindergarten, something changed. She became the target of insults and bullying. &#8220;I started getting beaten up almost every day,&#8221; said Anderson.</p>
<p>She soon retreated from peers and classmates, often pretending she was sick in order to stay home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really just shut down,&#8221; said Anderson.</p>
<p>By middle school, Anderson regularly got Ds and Fs. Although she tested well, she was listless about her classes and made little effort to complete the assignments. At home, she mostly stayed in her room playing video games and working on the computer.</p>
<p>Her main objective: stay off the radar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want anyone to notice me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I did everything in my power to be invisible.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was one bright spot, though. On the volleyball court, Anderson found a pursuit she could get excited about.</p>
<p>Although she was always last in running and stair-climbing drills, she would practice for hours on her own &#8212; bouncing the ball against the wall, jumping up stairs and juggling to improve her strength and coordination.</p>
<h3>The day it all made sense</h3>
<p>Then one day in junior year, the class watched a film about transgender kids.</p>
<p>For Anderson, it was a revelation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just started crying right there at my desk. It was the most incredible thing &#8212; to realize all my feelings had a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anderson began doing research and came to the realization that she had always, deep down, identified as a woman. She made the decision to come out to her family and begin taking the steps to make a physical transition.</p>
<p>She also chose a new name for herself: Chloe &#8212; from a Greek word that means beginning to blossom.</p>
<p>It was not an easy road. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fear early on in the transition,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Your body is very different, the way you feel is very different, the way you&#8217;re treated is very different than what you&#8217;re used to. The world you grew up in, everything you knew, just totally falls apart. And people aren&#8217;t necessarily that nice about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lost friends and her job as a tutor in an after-school program. Her family struggled to accept the decision.</p>
<p>Volleyball was her one constant. Even as her body was changing, the sport gave her motivation to keep focused.</p>
<p>She set herself a goal: to play women&#8217;s volleyball at the college level.</p>
<p>She practiced hours a day, every day and finally tried out for Orange Coast College. She was the last person to be cut from the team.</p>
<p>She cried for a while &#8212; then dusted herself off and followed up on the advice of a friend, who told her that Santa Ana was still recruiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coach said. &#8220;Come on over tomorrow. I&#8217;ll show you the gym. He wanted me immediately. The fact that I&#8217;m trans didn&#8217;t matter at all. He saw me for my athleticism and for how I played.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Finding a family at UC Santa Cruz</h3>
<p>Fast forward to today: Anderson arrived to her new home at UC Santa Cruz two weeks ago to begin fall training, with practice that goes for six hours a day, six days a week.</p>
<p>Her teammates have welcomed her as a fellow athlete. &#8220;They&#8217;re silly and goofy, and make me laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they don&#8217;t make her feel is different. "Our coaches really emphasize that everyone is there for each other. It&#8217;s all about loving each other and supporting each other as a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has fallen in love with Monterey Bay, the thickets of redwoods, and the deer that come up almost close enough to touch.</p>
<p>Having already gotten settled in her dorm room &#8212; <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/trans-identified-housing.html">in a new housing community for transgender students</a> &#8212; she&#8217;s looking forward to being just like everyone else around her.</p>
<p>As an older student and someone several years into her transition, she hopes to be able to provide perspective that can help younger students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transition is scary. It can be hard financially, emotionally and physically,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But since I took that step, my whole life went in the right direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s eager to experience what the university and Division III volleyball have to offer. But, in some ways, she&#8217;s already gotten what she&#8217;s always wanted: to be an ordinary person, enjoying life and excited about the future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/Chloe-Anderson-295x128.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/Chloe-Anderson-295x128.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Chloe-Anderson-295x128.jpg</name><display-name>Chloe-Anderson-295x128.jpg</display-name><file-size>12730</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>CHLOE ANDERSON</title><description>The third-year student is one of the first transgender athletes to participate in volleyball at the NCAA Division III level. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2487d4578072701713dacb13a5e8dc5a"><name>us-news-world-report-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ranks among top 30 U.S. public universities</title><summary>The campus also is one of the top 100 national universities, according to the annual rankings by U.S. News and World Report</summary><keywords>rankings, us news and world report, universities</keywords><start-date>1473778800000</start-date><display-name>Rankings</display-name><path>/2016/09/us-news-world-report-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/us-news-world-report-rankings</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1473786662602</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1473799574732</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/us-news-world.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/us-news-world.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>us-news-world.jpeg</name><display-name>us-news-world.jpeg</display-name><file-size>197755</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/us-news-report-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/us-news-report-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>us-news-report-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>us-news-report-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>5521</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is among the top 30 public national universities, according to the <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/ucsc-1321/overall-rankings">latest rankings</a> by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>.</p>

<div bgcolor="#FFFFFF">This week we are preparing to welcome more than 9,100 residential students to our community. University Housing will open its doors for occupancy&#160;beginning Thursday, Sept. 15, and student Move-In will continue through Sunday, Sept. 18.&#160; 
<div><br/>
 This is an exciting period for our students and their families, and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our university and community.&#160;However, residential Move-In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility. It is important to note the following&#160;restrictions and alternative parking options:&#160;</div>
<div><strong>&#8226; Most of the parking lots near colleges, and all three remote lots, will be restricted for Move-In purposes on different days during Move-In.</strong> On Thursday, close-in lots near Porter College will be restricted. On Friday, close-in lots near Merrill and Kresge will be restricted. For access during the weekend, please check the maps below for details:<br/>

<span><strong>&#8226; Vehicles without a valid Move-In permit will be cited if they park in restricted lots.</strong>&#160;(Vehicles with disability-related permits or placards are the&#160;exception to this rule.)<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; Because of these restrictions, those with A, B, or R permits may need to find alternative parking.</strong>&#160;Please check the day-specific maps for non-restricted parking options listed above. Those with R permits will be able to park in&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/104-overflow-map.pdf">East Remote Overflow Lots 2, 4, and 5</a>&#160;during Move In.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
</span> <strong>&#8226; From Thursday through Sunday, one-way traffic controls will be in place on Porter-Kresge Road.&#160;</strong>Traffic will only be allowed to go from Kresge to Porter; no traffic will be allowed to drive into the Porter entrance. Those needing to access Porter must enter through Kresge.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; From Thursday through Sunday, Hagar Drive will be closed to downhill traffic at Steinhart Way.</strong> Drivers are asked to use southbound Coolidge Drive (overlooking the Pogonip) to exit campus or access areas on Hagar south of the closure.</div>
<span>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the move-in period; This creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly&#160;on Thursday and Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor,&#160;if&#160;operationally feasible. We strongly encourage the use of alternative transportation options to get to campus (such as sharing a ride with a friend or&#160;colleague) to help accommodate the new student traffic.</span><br/>

Lagattuta)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz engineers use flexible silicone material to build an integrated optofluidic platform for biological sample processing and optical analysis</article-subhead><article-text><p>For well over a decade, electrical engineer Holger Schmidt has been developing devices for optical analysis of samples on integrated chip-based platforms, with applications in areas such as biological sensors, virus detection, and chemical analysis. The latest device from his lab is based on novel technology that combines high-performance microfluidics for sample processing with dynamic optical tuning and switching, all on a low-cost "chip" made of a flexible silicone material.</p>
<p>In previous devices from Schmidt's lab, optical functions were built into silicon chips using the same fabrication technology used to make computer chips. The new device is made entirely of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a soft, flexible material used in microfluidics as well as in products such as contact lenses and medical devices.</p>
<p>"We can use this fabrication method now to build an all-in-one device that allows us to do biological sample processing and optical detection on one chip," said Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics and director of the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Lightvalve</strong></p>
<p>The flexibility of PDMS allows for novel ways of controlling both light and fluids on the chip. Using multilayer soft lithography techniques, senior graduate student Joshua Parks built chips containing both solid-core and hollow-core waveguides for guiding light signals, as well as fluidic microvalves to control the movement of liquid samples. Schmidt and Parks also developed a special microvalve that functions as a "lightvalve," controlling the flow of both light and fluids.</p>
<p>"That opens up a whole new set of functions that we couldn't do on a silicon chip," Schmidt said. "The lightvalve is the most exciting element. In additional to a simple on-off switch, we built a moveable optical trap for analysis of biological particles such as viruses or bacteria."</p>
<p>Parks and Schmidt reported the results of initial experiments with the new device in a paper <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33008">published September 6 in <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/ebola-detection.html">previous study</a>, Schmidt, Parks, and colleagues at BYU and UC Berkeley demonstrated a hybrid device in which a PDMS microfluidic chip for sample preparation was integrated with a silicon-based optofluidic chip for optical detection of viral pathogens. The new device combines both functions on the same chip. In addition, Schmidt said, the materials are relatively inexpensive, allowing rapid prototyping of devices.</p>
<p>"We can do the full chain of fabrication here in our lab, and we can make new devices very quickly," he said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Diagnostic assays</strong></p>
<p>Schmidt said the potential applications for this technology include a wide range of biological sensors and analytical devices. For viral diagnostic assays, for example, fluorescently labeled antibodies can be used to tag specific viral strains for optical detection. In a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/multiplex-chip.html">recent paper</a>, Schmidt and colleagues demonstrated detection and identification of different flu strains using fluorescence detection in a multi-mode interference (MMI) waveguide. With the new device, they showed that they can actively tune an MMI waveguide on the chip.</p>
<p>The dynamic tuning of the optofluidic device is achieved by applying pressure to the optofluidic channel, changing its dimensions and thereby altering its photonic properties. "We can actually tune the spot pattern made in the channel by the interference waveguide, which we couldn't do with the silicon chip," Schmidt said.</p>

How to use philanthropy to create a healthier planet? How to create change, leverage it, inspire it? How to turn an oil tanker?</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to our morning coffee: We sit around going, what about this, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if &#8230;&#8221; says Claudia Webster.</p>
<p>Alec and Claudia help steward the philanthropy of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, created by Alec Webster&#8217;s parents. In figuring out how to do the most good they can with the dollars available, they look at many opportunities and possibilities. The more they have learned and observed, the more clear their focus has become on UC Santa Cruz and its environmental programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel like we&#8217;ve found this really special place in the universe. And this is what we want to do to bring attention to it, to strengthen it,&#8221; they say. In recognition of the Webster family&#8217;s commitment and support, the foundation is being honored in October with the <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/">2016 Fiat Lux Award</a> from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</p>
<p>Their most recent investment: <a href="rachel-carson-college.xml">endowing College Eight and naming it in honor of Rachel Carson</a>, whose book <em>Silent Spring</em> in the 1960s kick-started the modern environmental movement. Their decision was both pragmatic and symbolic. The money will support environmental programs, and the name will telegraph a larger message about UC Santa Cruz and its values. It will introduce Carson to new generations and remind earlier ones of her critical role in awakening public interest in the environment&#8212;including halting the unchecked use of pesticides and herbicides.</p>
<p>When the Websters first began considering an endowment for <a href="http://rachelcarson.ucsc.edu">College Eight</a>&#8212;Alec is an alumnus&#8212;someone suggested they could name it Webster College. &#8220;The person who suggested that did not know the Webster family,&#8221; says Alec. &#8220;That is not what we are about.&#8221; This year, when they again turned their attention to College Eight, it was college Provost Ronnie Lipschutz who presented the idea of naming it for Rachel Carson. Immediately, they knew it was right.</p>
<p>The Websters learned the power of symbolism from an earlier campus project&#8212;the falling down Hay Barn at the entrance to campus. In proposing to rebuild the historic barn, they encountered skeptics and physical and bureaucratic hurdles. Today, the rebuilt barn is a popular and vibrant home for environmental programs and community activities. And it is a landmark that symbolizes the university&#8217;s powerful connection to the land, and of a future built on a history.</p>
<h3>Growing into environmental activists</h3>
<p>Neither Alec nor Claudia started out as environmental activists&#8212;they grew into it. They met in the &#8217;70s in a geology class at UC Santa Barbara. (A class taught by Robert Norris, brother of Ken Norris, professor of natural history at UC Santa Cruz and marine mammal expert whose legacy includes founding the UC Natural Reserve System.)</p>
<p>Alec and Claudia dated, but their life together didn&#8217;t really start then. It would be 30 years later, after separate life experiences and being married to others, that they found each other again.</p>
<p>Alec had spent much of his career as a machinist helping design and build scientific instruments&#8212;for 14 years at the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. He helped build an instrument that studied collisions of electrons and anti-electrons for the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. And he was on the team that designed and prototyped the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It&#8217;s still orbiting, still taking data on gamma rays from cosmic sources.</p>
<p>The down-to-earth side of Alec became increasingly intrigued by the environment&#8212;by soil, and plants, and how they all work together. His first taste of that had been as a kid when he and his older brother built an urban compost pit. Now he was on a campus where agroecology and soil science were taught. He talked professors into letting him take their classes&#8212;Margaret Fitzsimmons, Karen Holl, Steve Gleissman, and others&#8212;and then-chancellor MRC Greenwood into letting him enroll as a re-entry student. In 2002, he had his degree in Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>Claudia, meanwhile, had spent much of her career teaching art and raising her children in San Diego County. She worked with inner city kids who lived 25 minutes from the ocean but had never seen the ocean. Who had no idea where milk came from and were stumped when she put a sweet potato in a jar of water to sprout. &#8220;How did you get the things to come out of the sweet potato?&#8221; they asked.</p>
<p>When Alec and Claudia reconnected, they found they not only enjoyed the outdoors together, but shared a deep commitment to environmental and social justice. It is a core value they see at work at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;not just given lip service&#8212;and that has led to their support of multiple initiatives on campus. In addition to environmental programs, they have supported the University Library and the effort to reopen the Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p>They especially want students to experience the natural environment, from growing food on the campus farm to sleeping on the ground in the wilds of the Big Creek Reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we making any progress?&#8221; asks Claudia. &#8220;My experience in teaching has told me you never know, when you put good out into the world, do your very best, you never know whose life you&#8217;ll touch.&#8221; She remembers a former student telling her she had a huge impact on his life. It had nothing to do with art: &#8220;You smiled at me even after I called you an insulting name.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Turning an oil tanker</h3>
<p>The Websters liken efforts to create change to turning a tanker at sea. &#8220;We need to change the direction of the oil tanker,&#8221; says Alec. &#8220;We can only do it a little bit at a time, but eventually the tanker will be turned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alec remembers standing on the shore as a boy with his dad&#8212;an engineer and inventor who pioneered life-saving cardiac catheters&#8212;as a huge tanker moved through the water. His dad told him the tanker was so big and heavy that even if there were something right in front of it, it would be unable to stop. He&#8217;s never forgotten that lesson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes thousands of people to create change. When you get into UC Santa Cruz, we&#8217;ve already picked 16,000 winners,&#8221; says Alec, who serves as a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and will become its next chair. Among his goals: increasing support for research and the student experience as part of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s how to help boatloads of kids, not handfuls,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The Websters hope their support for UC Santa Cruz will inspire others to give&#8212;in time, talents, resources. &#8220;This is not a spectator sport,&#8221; says Alec. &#8220;It takes people at all levels to make good things happen. Everybody has something to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alec returns to the difficulty of creating meaningful change in the world. &#8220;How do you turn the oil tanker? At sea, it takes forever. In harbor, you put a tug boat on its bow, you go chh, chh, chh&#8221; he says. &#8220;And you push.&#8221;</p>

Today, it&#8217;s getting a name befitting that passion: <a href="http://rachelcarson.ucsc.edu">Rachel Carson College</a>.</p>
<p>Rachel Carson, writer and conservationist, is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. Her 1962 book, <em>Silent Spring</em>, dramatically chronicled the damage caused by indiscriminate application of chemicals in an attempt to control pests. Her larger theme: humans are a part of nature&#8212;not its masters.</p>
<p>The naming gift <a href="webster-foundation-healthy-planet.xml">from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation</a> recognizes Carson for her courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues.</p>
<p>It establishes an endowment to ensure the college can provide research and educational opportunities for students in perpetuity and establishes a chair in ecology and environmental justice. Concurrently, citing the impact of Carson&#8217;s writings, a chair in science communication is also being created. The gift package totals $7 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could not think of anyone who would better embody the core values of UC Santa Cruz than this environmental pioneer,&#8221; Alec and Claudia Webster wrote in a letter to Chancellor George Blumenthal on their proposal to recognize Rachel Carson. &#8220;Rachel Carson challenged authority, risked everything, and changed the world for the better. In doing so, she provided a model that students need and deserve, and that we, as a society, require.&#8221;</p>
<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano is among those who share the sentiment. &#8220;It is wonderful to see Rachel Carson honored in this way. She exemplifies so much of what is right in life. She has long been one of my personal heroes: a champion for the environment, a woman excelling in science, a person of dignity.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Though Rachel Carson would not live to see its evolution, she ignited a new sensitivity and sensibility about the natural world. The toxin DDT would be banned and the use of many other lethal chemicals monitored and regulated. In 1970, the first Earth Day was held and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency founded.</p>
<p>College Eight, embracing the heightened awareness and commitment to a healthier planet, was established in 1972 with the theme Environment and Society. A few years later, it would become the base for the team of scientists, students, and volunteers who would save the peregrine falcon, pushed to the brink of extinction by the effects of DDT. College Eight quickly established its reputation for excellence in environmentalism. Its alumni include some of the nation&#8217;s leading environmental professionals.</p>
<h3>A philanthropic commitment</h3>
<p>With a strong focus on the environment and student experience, the Helen and Will Webster Foundation has supported multiple initiatives at UC Santa Cruz &#8211; including rebuilding the historic Hay Barn as a center for environmental programs. Five chairs have been established, four with environmental focus. The foundation&#8217;s support for environmental programs at UC Santa Cruz has its roots in the experiences of Alec and Claudia Webster: Alec is an Environmental Studies alumnus (College Eight, &#8217;02).</p>

<p>The Websters say that Carson, like UC Santa Cruz, epitomizes love of the natural world, ethical judgment based on sound scientific principles, and the persistence and courage to create change. In these and previous gifts, the Websters have been inspired by the combined commitment to social and environmental justice they see on campus. That and the unmistakable passion they see in faculty and students for what they do.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this gift, the Websters, working in collaboration with College Provost Ronnie Lipschutz, are again furthering our campus mission and demonstrating what makes UC Santa Cruz so unique. We are grateful for their support,&#8221; said Chancellor Blumenthal. &#8220;The naming of College Eight for Rachel Carson shines a bright light on who we are and what we do, and it inspires us to launch the next generation of environmental leaders&#8212;the next generation of Rachel Carsons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rachel Carson College Endowment will support environmental programs and initiatives that give students hands-on learning experiences and opportunities to examine policy and develop solutions that balance societal needs with protection and restoration of the environment.</p>
<p>Two new chairs, which received matching funds from the UC Office of the President, will further environmental programs by training science communicators and by bringing attention to issues of justice.</p>
<p>Partnering with the Websters in establishing the chairs are Mark Headley (Stevenson &#8217;83) and Christina Pehl. &#8220;We are honored to join with the Websters to advance undergraduate education and provide opportunities for students to wrestle with today&#8217;s challenges of social responsibility and the environment,&#8221; said Headley.</p>
<p>The new chairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Robert Headley Presidential Chair for Integral Ecology and Environmental Justice will be based in the college. The chair honors Mark Headley&#8217;s father, a longtime administrator at the UC Office of the President, and will be dedicated to educating students about the conceptual and applied aspects of environmental science and stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Science Communication Presidential Chair will be held by the director of the Science Communication program. The graduate-level program established in 1981 has trained hundreds of professional science writers and journalists, many leaders in their fields. It is the only such program in the U.S. that requires a degree in science and experience in research. It is the background that Carson herself had before she focused on writing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rachel Carson&#8217;s legacy</h3>
<p>Within two weeks of its release in 1962, <em>Silent Spring</em> was a bestseller. The chemical industry struck back, launching intense attacks on Carson&#8217;s reputation and scholarship. While terminally ill with breast cancer, she calmly defended her work at congressional hearings.</p>
<p>Among those deeply impressed with Carson&#8217;s work were President John F. Kennedy and Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall. Years later she would be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
<p><em>Silent Spring</em> drew its title from a striking decline in the nation&#8217;s bird populations &#8211; &#8220;the early mornings are strangely silent where once they were filled with the beauty of bird song,&#8221; Carson wrote. Just 18 months after the book&#8217;s publication, she died at age 56 at her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>
<p>Publication of <em>Silent Spring</em> followed a rich history of other contributions Carson made as a pioneering woman scientist. After studying biology at Pennsylvania College for Women, she earned a master&#8217;s in marine zoology at Johns Hopkins University, and studied at Woods Hole.</p>
<p>She spent much of her career at what became the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, conducting research and serving as editor-in-chief of all its publications. A gifted writer as well as naturalist, Carson wrote extensively about the ocean and marine life, including her award-winning bestseller <em>The Sea Around Us</em> (1951). Her other work included <em>Under the Sea-Wind</em> (1941) and <em>The Edge of the Sea</em> (1955).</p>
<p>Carson also wrote about the importance of sharing the wonder of nature with children&#8212;something she greatly enjoyed with Roger Allen Christie, her niece&#8217;s son, whom she adopted when his mother died when he was just 5 years old. The Sense of Wonder, about her outings with Roger, was published posthumously.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1963, Carson fulfilled her wish to see the California redwoods. Weak from her cancer and treatments, she travelled to San Francisco to speak about pollution of the environment to a major convocation of physicians. Afterward, from her wheelchair, she visited Muir Woods with a small group of friends, including fellow environmentalist David Brower.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the University of California campus where a college now bears Carson&#8217;s name is shaded by countless redwoods and sits at the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>Check Hayden was selected by a committee of UCSC faculty and alumni after a national search. She will succeed current director Robert Irion, who is retiring from the university after leading the program for 10 years.</p>
<p>"Erika brings great skills and talent to this role, with more than 15 years of experience in science journalism across print, digital and multimedia formats," says Paul Koch, dean of the Physical and Biological Sciences Division at UCSC. Koch <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/scicom-director.html">announced</a> Check Hayden's appointment today to the campus community.</p>
<p>"I believe that this is one of the most exciting and hopeful eras that science journalism has ever seen," Check Hayden says. "I say this both as a science journalist myself, and as an instructor for the past six years at the SciCom program, where I have seen many graduates begin to shape our field&#8217;s future. Recent years have brought serious change and challenge to our discipline. But the ever-growing array of new initiatives in science journalism, producing content across numerous formats, and in many cases drawing upon the talent and leadership of SciCom alumni, evinces the robust health of science journalism today.</p>
<p>"There is no more exhilarating calling that I can imagine than preparing enthusiastic, gifted students for world-changing careers in this field."</p>
<p>Check Hayden earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology at Stanford University, where she wrote for the <em>Stanford Daily</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><em>Stanford Alumni Magazine</em>. Her first job was as a science, health, and breaking news reporter for<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><em>Newsweek</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>in New York, where she was part of the team that covered 9/11. In 2001 she was hired to join the news and features team at<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><em>Nature</em>. She&#160;worked for five years at the U.S. headquarters for<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><em>Nature</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>in Washington D.C., and since 2006 she has been based in San Francisco. She covers trends, ethics, and research in biomedicine and the life sciences for the journal, as well as California news.</p>
<p>Check Hayden received funding from the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/project/africa-west-sierra-leone-ebola-epidemic-outbreak-survivors-hero-hope" target="_blank">Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>to travel to Sierra Leone in late 2014 to report first-hand on the outbreak of the Ebola virus for<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><em>Nature</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and&#160;<em>Wired</em>. She covered the country&#8217;s response to the crisis from the front lines, focusing on the brave and daunting work of health-care providers&#8212;including an international team of doctors and scientists that remained in the country at grave personal risk&#8212;and on the impacts of thousands of deaths in Sierra Leone on families and on pregnant women. Her coverage (including articles<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/maternal-health-ebola-s-lasting-legacy-1.17036" target="_blank">here</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/ebola-treatment/" target="_blank">here</a>) earned widespread acclaim, including three awards (<a href="http://healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=191#.V9pFVxArLYI">2014</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="http://healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=204#.V9pFoxArLYI" target="_blank">2015</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>announcements)&#160;from the Association of Health Care Journalists. She spoke about her experiences in<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/scicom-slugs/reporting-on-ebola-from-west-africa" target="_blank">this interview</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>with SciCom alumna Laurel Hamers (class of '16).</p>
<p>In 2010, Check Hayden began teaching for the SciCom program in a course that she created, leading students through the dynamic and often fraught world of social media and their central role in science journalism today. Under her guidance, Santa Cruz students have made key national connections with editors, developed their voices as bloggers, and cultivated an online presence that helps them find and report stories.</p>
<p>The director's search committee was chaired by Doug Kellogg, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Members were Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences; Anthony Aguirre, professor of physics; Ken Doctor, former UC Santa Cruz Foundation president and noted media analyst at <a href="http://newsonomics.com/" target="_blank">Newsonomics</a>; and Kathleen Wong, a 1999 SciCom graduate and principal publications coordinator for the <a href="http://www.ucnrs.org/" target="_blank">UC Natural Reserve System</a>. The committee received input from other SciCom lecturers, a panel of local program alumni, and the program's most recently graduated students.</p>
<p>Founding director John Wilkes, who earned his Ph.D. in English literature from UC Santa Cruz, established the Science Communication Program in 1981. Wilkes<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/wilkes" target="_blank">served as director for 25 years</a>.

Erika was selected from a highly competitive search. She brings great skills and talent to this role, with 15 years of experience in science journalism across print, digital and multimedia formats. Erika began her career as a science writer at Newsweek, then moved to cover biomedical science at Nature, first as a correspondent, and for the last decade as a senior reporter. Her recent work on the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which included boots-on-the-ground reporting in Sierra Leone supported by a fellowship from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, was riveting; it received multiple awards. And Erika is no stranger to UC Santa Cruz. Since 2010, she has been a lecturer in the Science Communication Program, focusing on new digital modes of communication in science journalism. She has taught in a variety of science journalism workshops and other programs around the nation. Erika will be teaching again this fall, and then taking over as director on January 1.</p>
<p>I want to thank the search committee, including the chair, Doug Kellogg (MCD Biology), the other faculty members, Christina Ravelo (Ocean Sciences) and Anthony Aguirre (Physics), and our two outside members, Ken Doctor (former UC Santa Cruz Foundation President and noted media analyst) and Kathleen Wong (a SciCom alum and Principal Publications Coordinator for UC Natural Reserves System). The committee did a great job identifying top candidates; I appreciate their efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, the campus has benefited from the vision, teaching, and stewardship of outgoing Science Communication Director Rob Irion. For the last decade, Rob kept the program fresh and vital as the landscape for science journalism changed tremendously. Rob has been a forceful advocate for science journalism at the national level, an outstanding mentor for our students, and a tireless fundraiser for the program. I hope to announce a major outcome of the philanthropic efforts he has spurred in the next few weeks. I am grateful for his fantastic work over the last decade and wish him well as he returns to journalism full time.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz

community</article-subhead><article-text><p>The game design program at UC Santa Cruz will be well represented at the <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/2016">2016 IndieCade Festival</a>, which celebrates the best independent games of the year.</p>
<p>Four games developed by UC Santa Cruz students have been announced as <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/2016/games">official nominees</a> for IndieCade awards, and UCSC students will also take part in a panel on "Games as Protest" during IndieXchange, a series of workshops and sessions for developers that precedes the festival.</p>
<p>"We appear to have the strongest IndieCade presence of any university this year," said Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>For the "Games as Protest" panel, Mark Biundo, Jason Brisson, and possibly other members of their team will discuss their work on a game called <a href="https://projectperfectcitizen.itch.io/project-perfect-citizen"><em>Project Perfect Citizen</em></a>, which won the Grand Prize at the <a href="https://sammys.soe.ucsc.edu/2016-awards">2016 Sammy Awards</a>, the annual awards ceremony hosted by the UCSC <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> for students enrolled in the game design program. <em>Project Perfect Citizen</em> is an interactive narrative experience that explores issues of privacy, security, and government surveillance in the modern digital age. The game puts the player in the shoes of a government surveillance officer who is responsible for hunting down cybercriminals and has access to the digital lives of citizens, creating ethical quandaries that force the player to grapple with difficult issues.</p>
<p>"We tried to create realistic characters that the player can empathize with, and scenarios where it's not black and white whether this person is doing something the government should be concerned with. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive," said Biundo, one of seven undergraduates in the game design program who worked on the game, along with two art students and lead writer Brisson, a legal studies student.</p>
<p><strong>Four nominees</strong></p>
<p>The nominees for IndieCade awards this year include the UCSC games <a href="http://seancegame.com/"><em>S&#233;ance</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="http://shackle-game.com/"><em>Shackle</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="http://www.badnewsgame.com/"><em>Bad News</em></a><em>,</em> and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/project/threadsteading/"><em>Threadsteading</em></a><em>.</em> <em>S&#233;ance</em> is an interactive installation about communicating with the dead, created by Mitch Mastroni and Kelsey Coffman, both undergraduates in the computer game design program. It earned second place in the Sammy Awards Grand Prize competition.</p>
<p><em>Shackle</em> is a two-person cooperative horror game for the Oculus Rift virtual reality system, in which players find themselves trapped on opposite sides of a haunted room. It was created by a team of nine undergraduates: Hayden Platt, Lauren Cunningham, Dara Diba, Ryan Connors, Jarrett van dan Bergh, Silivia Ordonez, Joey Schutz, Fangzheng Han, and Tommy Schutz.</p>
<p><em>Bad News</em>, developed by graduate students Ben Samuel, James Ryan, and&#160;Adam Summerville, uses artificial intelligence to simulate the history of a fictional small town and combines gameplay with improvisational theater. The player must accomplish a task by interacting with townspeople in a live performance, with actors playing the townspeople and using the simulation to guide their improvisations.</p>
<p>Graduate student April Grow was a core member of the team that developed <em>Threadsteading</em> at <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh, where she was an intern. UCSC alumna Gillian Smith was also on the team, and Grow and Smith will both be representing the game at IndieCade. <em>Threadsteading</em> is a two-player game played entirely on a modified quilting machine, and each round of the game results in a permanent physical artifact: a quilt.</p>
<p>Although computation underlies the experience in all of these games, in several of them the players interact not with computer screens but with objects and people in the physical world. According to Jim Whitehead, professor of computational media, this is part of a growing trend known as "alternate controller" (alt.ctrl) games.</p>
<p>"As screens become ever more pervasive in our lives, designers and players are resonating more with games that are more embedded in the physical world," Whitehead said. "In the case of <em>S&#233;ance</em>, the intent is to completely hide the fact that computation underlies the experience. Then using a live actor contributes tremendously to the sense of immersion created by the alternate controller devices used in the game."</p>
<p>This is the sixth year in a row that games created by UC Santa Cruz students have been among the official nominees at IndieCade. The interactive fiction piece <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/icebound-award.html"><em>Ice-Bound</em></a>, created by graduate students Aaron Reed and Jacob Garbe, won the Story/World Design Award at the 2014 IndieCade Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Steam Greenlight</strong></p>
<p>Beyond IndieCade, student games from UC Santa Cruz are being recognized in other settings as well. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=749983604"><em>Ulama: Arena of the Gods</em></a><em>,</em> created by a team of graduate students in the <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Games and Playable Media</a> master's program (Pedro Cori, Alexander Formoso, and Cong Liu), was "greenlit" by the Steam community in just 15 days. Steam Greenlight, part of Valve's Steam digital distribution platform, is a way for users to help choose which games are added to the service. Earlier this year, the same team (Trainwreck Games) <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/gamejam-winners.html">won a game design competition</a> at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fc6d7c08072701713dacb1341d0d562"><name>illingworth-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Garth Illingworth to receive Astronomical Society's Berkeley Prize</title><summary>Illingworth will receive the 2016 Lancelot M.

<p>&#8220;They deserve to be up here and taking advantage of this place,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, who, as director of the summer session program, has been helping to strengthen regional contacts and welcome pre-college students. &#8220;Inviting high school students to experience college-level courses and campus culture has been a high priority of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Summer Session includes two five-week intensive terms that provide transferable credits for students seeking a leg up in their academic journey.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz High School senior Matthew Phillips, 17, who signed up for a beginning Japanese language summer session course before his junior year, liked it so much that he returned this last summer for Literature 61F, a study of the graphic novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of a good deal for me to take the class,&#8221; he said, noting that the class not only counts towards his graduation as an advanced placement English course, gives him college experience and lightens his course load for his senior year, but it provided a summer job on campus at an IT help desk in a campus library.</p>
<p>Phillips warns prospective high school students, however, that despite fewer class hours and greater independence, college is &#8220;way harder&#8221; than high school. He&#8217;s had to learn a new style of writing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot more based on understanding the material rather than just being able to name off random facts about the books,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For Pacific Collegiate School junior Ruby Rorty, 16, summer included an intense five-week anthropology course on global environmental change, a study of capitalism, industrialization, environmental politics and global culture, not the usual high school material.</p>
<p>Rorty, like any serious high school student, says she loves the words &#8220;college credit,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not the only reason she signed up. The course gave her the opportunity to practice being a college student and, more importantly, she said, &#8220;it addressed so many of the issues my generation will face as we seek to remedy and prevent environmental damage&#8212;issues I hope to spend the rest of my life trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although, one of the most rigorous classes she&#8217;s ever taken, it was not as scary as she thought it would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;It required me to think harder about the world around me than just about any other course I&#8217;ve taken,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rorty was also able to work on campus as an intern in one of the biology labs studying the bacteria of fruit flies. Older classmates talked to her about the college application process and shared their early college experiences.</p>
<p>About 90 percent of the 3,800 students enrolled in 280 summer session courses was made up of UC Santa Cdruz undergraduate students. The other 10 percent was visitors from other campuses and high schools. High school enrollment has more than tripled in the past three years.</p>
<p>Courses this past summer ranged from introductory classes in astronomy, computer science, calculus, psychology and acting, to more unique offerings such as the geology of national parks, holocaust studies, and 3D printing, as well as special programs focusing on the works of Dickens or developing renewable energy.</p>
<p>About half of the high school students <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/summer/session.html">live on campus</a>. Others commute from home or take online courses. <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/i-am-a-an/high-school.html">High school students pay</a> $136 per unit, a 50 percent discount. Once enrolled as a UC Santa Cruz student, high school students are invited to enjoy the perks that go along with a student ID, such as access to the gym, campus tutoring, the UC library system, and a student bus pass. They can pick strawberries at the farm and hold part-time jobs on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;For many of them it&#8217;s a sudden and exciting thrust into adulthood,&#8221; Parikh said. &#8220;To think of this place being a resource for them is exhilarating.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="354ae0bb8072701713dacb1306e6fb42"><name>community-meditation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Meditation sessions open to campus community</title><summary>The sessions are free and open to faculty, staff, and students.

 Those who usually travel on Hagar Drive between McLaughlin Drive and the East Remote Parking Lot &#160;should be advised that there will be a high volume of pedestrians along Hagar between 2pm-6:30pm. In addition, the East Field Service Road will be one way (northbound) from 12:30pm to 2:45pm near the Wellness Center, and closed to all vehicles from 2:45 pm until 6:3<span><span class="gmail-aBn" tabindex="0"><span class="gmail-aQJ">0pm</span></span>. &#160;</span><br/>

 &#160;<br/>
 Over the summer, the Bike Path has been re-graded and realigned for better sight lines and a longer, smoother curve just above the Village Road intersection. Construction will continue at the adjacent Resource Recovery Center for the next few weeks, with many heavy-duty vehicles crossing the path tomorrow.&#160;Once the Bike Path reopens, cyclists should proceed with caution near that intersection.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 As always, those who ride bikes on campus are advised to ride cautiously and wear a helmet at all times. Please remember that, due to safety reasons, the Great Meadow Bike Path is for day use only, and is closed at night.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 This safety project was primarily funded through a $383,000 grant in state Active Transportation Program (ATP) funds; campus funds provided the local match.<br/>

<p>I also want to take this opportunity to remind the UC Santa Cruz community that university resources (including paid time of university employees and non-incidental use of university equipment and facilities) should not be used to campaign for or against any candidate for public political office or any initiative proposition that is on the ballot. University employees have a constitutional right to participate in political advocacy in their capacity as private citizens, but may not lawfully use public resources to engage in political campaigning for or against candidates or ballot measures and should take care to avoid any implication that their private political activities are carried out in their university capacities or are otherwise endorsed by the university.</p>
<p>The university has <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/state-governmental-relations/advocacy/legal-guidelines-ballot-campaigns.html">posted guidance</a> on the applicable rules governing use of University resources in connection with campaign activities, particularly in the context of ballot initiatives.

'This is a way of feeling at home.'</article-subhead><article-text><p>Niels Bohr played football. Edwin Hubble was known for his prowess with the shot-put. Enrico Fermi was fearsome on the tennis court.</p>
<p>To this list of scientists who were also accomplished athletes, we can add Pelayo Menendez Fernandez, a graduate student from Spain who has spent this summer working as a researcher at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Long Marine Laboratory while making his mark as an Ironman triathlete.</p>
<p>While in the midst of researching threatened mangrove forests, the Ph.D. candidate pursued his passion for triathlons&#8212;and put in such a strong performance at the Ironman race in Santa Cruz, Sept, 11, that he has qualified, and registered for, the Ironman 70.3 World Championship, scheduled for Chattanooga, Tenn., next September.</p>
<p>The competition began with a splash of well-chilled ocean water. First he slipped on a wetsuit and charged into the Pacific. The suit gave him some buoyancy and protected him from the 58-degree water. Fernandez swam around the wharf, slipped out of the water, took off the wetsuit, got on a bike at the Boardwalk amusement park, and pedaled out to Pescadero and back on Highway 1.</p>
<p>At that point he took to his feet and ran along West Cliff Drive and into Wilder Ranch State Park, picking up the pace, making up time lost in the ocean. &#8220;I am not a very strong swimmer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Out of 40 sponsored professional competitors, Fernandez ranked 19th overall, which means he bested over half the professional athletes competing in the race.&#160;</p>
<p>Pelayo ranked No. 1 in his age group, and had the overall fastest amateur time across all competitors.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pelayo not only proved to be an outstanding athlete in this grueling race, but he also represented Santa Cruz extremely well,&#8221; said Maria Choy, administrative specialist for UCSC&#8217;s Ocean Health division. &#8220;It makes me wish I had him compete wearing a UCSC Long Marine Lab cap!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fernandez lives in scenic, drizzly Santander, Spain, where he is studying coastal engineering at the Environmental Hydraulics Institute of Cantabria.</p>
<p>In Santa Cruz, he has been working in collaboration with Mike Beck and Borja G. Reguero of the Nature Conservancy. Fernandez studies coral reefs and mangroves, focusing on their role as buffers against waves that threaten the shorelines of Mexico, the Philippines, and the southeastern coast of the United States. More than a third of the world&#8217;s mangroves are now gone due to firewood overharvesting and clear-cutting, Climate change has also taken a toll on the forests and the coral reefs.</p>
<p>Using a framework developed with the World Bank, Fernandez is studying the link between risk reductions and the preservation of these threatened ecosystems.</p>
<p>His work requires stamina and concentration, with an unbreakable focus on long-term goals, much like an Ironman race. But Fernandez, 26, finds that an all-consuming race, and the organization and preparations beforehand, serve as a reset button for him, allowing him to go further in his scientific explorations. Apparently, he is not the only researcher who sees this link; it was Borja G. Reguero of the Nature Conservancy who urged Fernandez to compete in the local Ironman.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz race was his second half Ironman this year &#8211; and ever &#8211; but Fernandez has also competed in more than 20 races this year, including the Duathlon World Championships in Spain, in which he ranked third in the 25-to-29 year old category.</p>
<p>When asked about the relationship between his life as a scientist and researcher and his life as an athlete, Fernandez said, &#8220;the relationship is that there&#160;<em>is</em>&#160;no relation.&#8221; In other words, the separateness of these realms make them complementary.</p>
<p>He thinks of &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;athletics&#8221; as lives unto themselves.&#160; &#8220;Both lives are completely different,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t usually mix them. But sports help me clean my head during the day, and forget any worries that I have in the work. It is a way of forgetting the researcher&#8217;s life for just a couple of hours a day, and then going back to work. They are different worlds &#8230; I can&#8217;t live without either one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironman competitions and research projects require strategy, a steady pace, and a long view of outcomes.&#160; &#8220;When I compete, I don&#8217;t usually start very fast,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Even when he&#8217;s training, &#8220;I try to think about the previous day, to organize everything. This is also the way I am in my research.&#8221;</p>
<p>His Santa Cruz triathlon was his second competition this year; previously he competed in Spain, where he was first overall in his age group.&#160; Asked if he has ever run into the dreaded &#8220;wall,&#8221; or experienced that dreadful phenomenon known as the &#8220;bonk,&#8221; when an athlete feels as if he&#8217;s drawn his last droplet of energy,&#160; Fernandez said no.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Ironman I didn&#8217;t feel that because I was eating during the whole (competition.) I was hydrated and well fed. If you don&#8217;t irrigate properly, if you don&#8217;t eat enough, after a couple of miles, you will feel really bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>These competitions are his way of connecting with a community, no matter where he is studying in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a way of feeling at home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Soon, Fernandez will return to rainy Santander, but he hopes to come back and continue his studies at UCSC next year if possible. Now he has a great excuse to be back in the states: the World Championships a year from now.</p>
<p>Within two hours of learning his qualifying time in the Sept. 11 Ironman, he had to plunk down $400, right on the spot, to sign up for the World&#8217;s. He was happy to pay the fee.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I am just an amateur,&#8221; he said. "In other words, I do sports because I love it. This is not my income. I don&#8217;t get money from this. This is my philosophy. If I do this for fun, everything I get from it will be welcome.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4de88f858072701713dacb134dccfdde"><name>czi-haussler</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Genomics leader David Haussler to advise Chan Zuckerberg science initiative</title><summary>The professor of biomolecular engineering is among the experts who helped shape the initiative's new focus on science.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, BioHub</keywords><start-date>1474484400000</start-date><display-name>Genomics leader David Haussler to advise Chan Zuckerberg science initiative</display-name><path>/2016/09/czi-haussler</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/czi-haussler</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1474480867915</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1474489378310</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/david-haussler-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/david-haussler-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-350.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>93530</file-size><width>350</width><height>409</height></image><image-alt>David Haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/david-haussler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/david-haussler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16427</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>David Haussler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>David Haussler&#160; (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Professor of biomolecular engineering is among the experts who helped shape the initiative's new focus on science.</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> (CZI), launched in 2015 by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan with an initial focus on education, has announced that its second major focus will be on basic science research to advance disease prevention and treatment. CZI will make an initial investment of at least $3 billion over the next decade to accelerate medical research.</p>
<p>David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> at UC Santa Cruz, was among the top scientists and experts who helped shape the initiative's approach and identify opportunities to have a real impact. He is also one of seven influential leaders appointed to a Science Advisory Board for the initiative.</p>
<p>"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is poised to transform biomedicine with empowering new technology and a new spirit of cooperation," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The initiative's first major investment in basic science research will be the creation of a new independent research center called Biohub. Based at the UCSF Mission Bay campus and formed in partnership with UCSF, UC Berkeley, and Stanford University, the center will serve as a nexus for collaborations between experts across multiple disciplines. Biohub will be led by UCSF biochemist and UC Santa Cruz alumnus Joseph DeRisi and Stanford bioengineer Stephen Quake.</p>
<p>Neurobiologist Cori Bargmann of Rockefeller University will provide overall leadership of CZI's science efforts. In announcing the new focus on science, Zuckerberg described three core elements of the initiative's approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing scientists and engineers together in new ways to tackle major questions in basic science and unlock widespread medical breakthroughs;</li>
<li>Building tools and technology that will dramatically scale up what is possible in research today; and</li>
<li>Growing the movement to fund science around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, is a pioneer in genomics research and an international leader in efforts to advance genomic medicine. He is a cofounder of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, an international nonprofit that is helping establish the infrastructure for data sharing in genomic medicine.</p>
<p>As a collaborator on the international Human Genome Project, Haussler's team posted the first publicly available assembly of the human genome sequence online in 2000 and subsequently developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a widely used tool for biomedical researchers. His group's work in cancer genomics includes creating the first public cancer genome database for the National Cancer Institute (CGHub) and collaborations with cancer researchers at medical centers nationally on efforts to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://chanzuckerberg.com/faq/</url><title>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative FAQ</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="52ba1a818072701713dacb134a7f178d"><name>fall-class-diversity-access</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Entering class increases diversity, access</title><summary>The growth in undergraduate enrollment, 650 more California undergraduates than fall 2015, is part of the University of California’s commitment to enroll 5,000 more students across the UC system, providing greater access to the state’s students.</summary><keywords>fall enrollment, growth, access, education</keywords><start-date>1474556400000</start-date><display-name>Fall enrollment</display-name><path>/2016/09/fall-class-diversity-access</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/fall-class-diversity-access</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1474561709338</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1474920629883</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/residence-hall-400px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/residence-hall-400px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>residence-hall-400px.jpeg</name><display-name>residence-hall-400px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>48484</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Students moving in</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/enrollment-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/enrollment-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>enrollment-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>enrollment-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>5396</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Move-in</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>More than 3,800 of the undergraduates hail from California, with the remaining 430 coming from 36 other states and 20 different countries.

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be happier to see the increases in California residents and our increases in students coming from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds,&#8221; said Michael McCawley, director of admissions.</p>
<p>The growth in undergraduate enrollment, 650 more California undergraduates than fall 2015, is part of the University of California&#8217;s commitment to enroll 5,000 more students across the UC system, providing greater access to the state&#8217;s students.</p>
<p>The incoming undergraduates show more ethnic diversity from fall 2015. African American/Black students increased by 38% (63 more students), American Indian/Alaskan Native increased by 47.6% (20 more students), and Hispanic students increased by 12.1% (156 more students). The academic profile of the incoming frosh remains very strong with a mean GPA of 3.7 and all test scores (ACT and SAT) showing increases. Approximately one third of the incoming students will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;The campus remains committed to admitting and enrolling first-year students and transfer students that truly reflect the rich diversity of our state and are well-prepared to handle the rigors of a UC Santa Cruz education,&#8221; said McCawley, &#8220;and the same holds true for the students coming from outside of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 3,800 of the undergraduates hail from California, with the remaining 430 coming from 36 other states and 20 different countries.</p>
<p>The campus has also enrolled about 1,075 California transfer students and about 50 nonresident transfers, and plans to welcome 100 to 125 more in winter quarter. Nearly 98% of the transfer students are coming from a California community college.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has invested in resources to support the larger class&#8212;increasing the capacity of on-campus housing from 9,000 to 9,300 beds, hiring more faculty, lecturers, and staff, and deploying new online tools to help with student advising. The campus is committed to freshmen graduating in 4 years or less, including developing some three-year pathways for certain majors by using summer session enrollment to expedite the time to degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have new programs in place and with existing programs are fully committed to raising the achievement and graduation rates of all our students,&#8221; said Interim Vice Provost for the Division of Student Success Jaye Padgett.</p>
<p>This academic year, UC Santa Cruz will have <a href="new-faculty.xml">more than three dozen new senate faculty</a> members, bringing the campus total up to 577.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic Serving Institution member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, with 30 percent of undergraduates identifying as Hispanic or Latino.</p>
<p>The HSI status helped the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html">campus win two grants</a>&#8212;totaling $3.6 million&#8212;from the U.S. Department of Education that will help UC Santa Cruz increase achievement for Latinos and all students on campus.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also dedicated to helping students pay for college. In 2014&#8211;15, 82 percent of undergraduate students received a $298 million in financial aid or campus employment. Additionally, 92 percent of UC Santa Cruz graduate students received $58 million in aid or employment.</p>

Much work and preparation has been done to begin the academic year, and we want to wish you great success as the quarter begins.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Last year, we began a concerted effort to communicate with all students about our on-going commitment to enhance safety on our campus. As part of this continual effort, please keep in mind that we will have a very visible police presence with additional officers and staff on duty, especially during the first six weeks of school. If you see one of our officers or staff members, please take a moment to engage them in conversation, as we're committed to continue building relationships with the community we serve.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We also want to continue the dialogue we began last year regarding the prevalence of alcohol and other drugs, and overdose deaths. Your health and welfare is our number one concern. Over the past week we have already had several students transported for emergency hospitalizations due to alcohol and/or drug poisoning.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Please be aware of the risks, and avoid putting yourself and your friends in harm's way. <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/overdose-prevention/making-the-call.html">Call 911 without hesitation if you suspect someone is experiencing alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose.</a> Even if you aren't sure or don't want any trouble, please call. You could save the life of a fellow student or community member.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As some of you know, the beginning of the school year, and particularly the first few weekends, are times when we see large crowds gathering and/or large parties, both on and off the campus. Now is the time for you to carefully consider your participation in these sorts of events. These planned and impromptu events may get the attention of the UC Santa Cruz Police Department and our local law enforcement partners and result in police intervention that may result in arrest or citation. Additionally, our student conduct officers in the colleges and in the Dean of Students office uphold all campus policies and hold all students accountable for their actions, whether on or off campus.</div>
<div></div>
<div>UC Santa Cruz is a safe place to live and work but it is not crime-free. As you move about the campus and the city, if you see something, say something. Report suspicious behavior, crime, and emergency situations by dialing 911.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>GETTING HELP</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>This year,&#160;<a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> (SHOP) is beginning a new peer education program called <em><strong>Party like a SLUG! What's your Party Plan?</strong></em>. It is based on the philosophy that you can have a fun social life in college without putting yourself or others in danger. That you can drink without bingeing or blacking out. That you can experiment without putting yourself at risk for synergistic overdose. That you can have fun while still taking care of yourself and your peers.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em><strong>Party Like a SLUG! What's Your Party Plan?</strong></em> Party Safe Ambassadors will strive to provide information, strategies, and opportunities to engage in honest dialogue to help make your partying experience safer and more fun. Learn about creating party plans to make your experience fun and safe!</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you or someone you care about needs support around overuse of alcohol and/or drugs or would like to learn more about obtaining a naloxone kit, utilize the <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu">resources provided to students</a> through SHOP in the Cowell Student Health Center. SHOP is a safe, confidential, and nonjudgmental space where students can talk about alcohol and other drugs. SHOP also provides services for <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/students-in-recovery/">students in recovery</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For faculty and staff, assistance is available through the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Remember, it takes <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></em></strong> of us to combat the alcohol and drug-related challenges that we have seen in increasing numbers recently.</div>
<div></div>

<p>But Adriana Renteria (Stevenson &#8217;15, environmental studies and economics), coordinator for the campus initiative called the People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC), points out that certain &#8220;green practices&#8221; are older than the hills&#8212;a fact her organization is trying to make more widely known.</p>
<p>Now the PoCSC is getting high praise for increasing awareness about the various ways people of color contribute to sustainable practices, while holding dialogues about the intersections between race, class, ethnicity, gender, national origin, culture, and the environment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, those interested in sustainability can overlook the longstanding traditions that people of color bring to the table, including growing practices and lifestyle choices, said Renteria.</p>
<p>She draws attention to certain sustainable lifestyle and survival choices that are often labeled as practices of the &#8220;poor&#8221;&#8212;from riding the bus to work every day to hanging clothes to dry on a clothesline. With such practices in mind, the initiative works to &#8220;redefine sustainability in a way that recognizes that (sustainable practices) are within our cultures,&#8221; Renteria said.</p>
<p>In this way, the group seeks to re-examine the definition of sustainability; it seeks to make the sustainability movement more inclusive of different cultural practices and interpretations&#8212;a notion PoCSC hopes is embraced by environmentalists at large, since engaging and including more of the world's population would advance the movement's objectives.</p>
<p>PoCSC &#8211; which is housed under UCSC&#8217;s American Indian Resource Center -- &#160;is innovative and unique because &#8220;it bridges what we do well (at UC Santa Cruz): diversity on the one hand and sustainability on the other,&#8221; said Flora Lu, one of the collaborators involved with PoCSC, and a faculty mentor for the initiative.</p>
<p>Lu, a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, as well as provost for Colleges Nine and Ten, said the initiative wants to ensure that sustainability efforts &#8220;really resonate with the entire student body, in all of its diversity,&#8221; recognizing that people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds have their own unique and valuable ways of relating to the land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our relationships to place and our connection to stewardship of the environment: these really stem out of our social relationships with each other,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;We sometimes think of nature as separate from culture; that separation is false.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Engaging with events</strong></p>
<p>PoCSC student interns&#8212;all of them interns at the campus&#8217;s Ethnic Resource Centers&#8212;have worked hard to put on a series of engaging events highlighting the initiative&#8217;s objectives.</p>
<p>The collective will host a workshop about environmental racism at the on-campus <a href="http://practicalactivism.ucsc.edu/">Practical Activism Conference on October 22.</a> The workshop will focus, in particular, on environmental impacts confronting the communities of Bayview/Hunters Point in southeastern San Francisco and Kettleman City in Kings County, as well as the issue of &#8220;food insecurity" in South Central Los Angeles. This term relates to communities that have limited access to healthy foods.</p>
<p>This year, the collective was honored with a Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity&#8212;impressive considering the collective is a relatively new presence on campus, having started as the hashtag #pocsustainability.</p>
<p>The hashtag was created by the Ethnic Resource Center directors to provide a platform for students to share stories about their cultural sustainability practices and push back against the false notion that communities of color don&#8217;t care about the environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We at PoCSC are trying to weave together the connections between people and the different spaces across campus,&#8221; said Raymond LeBeau (Stevenson &#8217;18, environmental studies), a member of the Pit River Nation in northeastern California. &#8220;It can be a difficult task. But the fact that PoCSC has grown from a hashtag into a campuswide initiative makes me feel that all of this work, growth, and interconnection is very important.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration, research</strong></p>
<p>As student response grew, the initiative began hosting small group discussions and events to create community on campus.</p>
<p>This initiative is the result of careful coordination among various organizations on campus; the PoCSC was founded in 2013 at the Ethnic Resource Centers, and is housed under the American Indian Resource Center and Director, Rebecca H. Rosser. &#160;Recognizing that this issue needs to be addressed by the whole campus, a collaborative partnership between Colleges Nine and Ten and the Campus Sustainability Office was established.</p>
<p>PoCSC has also been working with the campus Institutional Research and Policy Studies Office to undertake undergraduate research. PoCSC students will host student-led focus groups in the winter quarter and will present the results of the research and focus groups in early spring quarter. PoCSC will use the results of the research to plan future programming and develop resources.</p>
<p>This academic year, PoCSC is working to create a food justice online orientation program for all incoming students to explain what food insecurity is and highlight the resources that are available to help students address their needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Responses (to PoCSC events) have been overwhelmingly positive,&#8221; Renteria said, noting that all events are open to students from every background.</p>
<p>Elida Erickson, campus sustainability director, praised the PoCSC for addressing a longstanding issue.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Historically, the environmental conservation movement has not always been inclusive of diverse cultural viewpoints, and in some cases has championed initiatives that have directly marginalized certain groups," she said. "One glaring example of this is the displacement of many native peoples from their land with the creation of national parks."</p>
<p>Even within the university community, there are many examples of students of color feeling marginalized by their involvement with campus environmental movement, she continued.&#160;</p>
<p>"PoCSC&#160;has created a space for students of color to share their experiences, have a voice, and start shifting the direction of the conversation around environmental issues to be more inclusive of different cultural perspectives,&#8221; Erickson said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="539e765b8072701713dacb1319229992"><name>documenta-art-greece</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art professor to stage 'exercise of freedom' at former military police headquarters in Greece at Documenta 14</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens and her artistic collaborator Annie Sprinkle will participate this weekend in Documenta 14, one of the most prestigious art exhibitions in Europe.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, elizabeth stephens, documenta 14, ucsc art department, ucsc arts division</keywords><start-date>1474582500000</start-date><display-name>Art professor to stage 'exercise of freedom'  at Documenta 14</display-name><path>/2016/09/documenta-art-greece</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/documenta-art-greece</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1474576675125</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1474584070779</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/beth-stephens-annie-water-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/beth-stephens-annie-water-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-stephens-annie-water-400.jpg</name><display-name>beth-stephens-annie-water-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>156381</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens (left) with her artistic collaborator Annie</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/beth-annie-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/beth-annie-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-annie-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>beth-annie-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22799</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens (left) with her artistic collaborator Annie</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens (right) with her artistic collaborator Annie Sprinkle</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz art professor and multimedia artist Elizabeth Stephens and her artistic collaborator Annie Sprinkle will participate this weekend in <a href="http://www.documenta14.de/en/"><em><strong>Documenta 14</strong></em></a>--one of the most prestigious art exhibitions in Europe.<br/>
 <br/>
 Stephens and Sprinkle are creating a water performance in an effort to help cleanse a former police station of some of its violent history surrounding events that happened there during Greece&#8217;s fascist period. <br/>
 <br/>
 In a late night email from Athens, Greece, Stephens described what she and Sprinkle will be doing at the public program that takes place Friday night at the Athens Municipality Arts Center at Parko Eleftherias.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This portion of Documenta 14&#8217;s program is entitled, <em>The Parliament of Bodies</em> and consists of &#8216;34 Exercises in Freedom&#8217;,&#8221; said Stephens. &#8221;The understanding of freedom here is premised on Michel Foucault&#8217;s notion that freedom is never a given, a natural state of being, or an automatic right; freedom is a practice. Like all practices, freedom must be exercised on a regular basis, so Paul B. Preciado, the curator of Public Programs, titled the acts in this program as a series of numbered exercises.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Our exercise is #25,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We will be giving an hour-long lecture about our collaborative work titled <em>Post-Porn Activism and Ecosexual Freedom</em>. Then we are going to perform a collaborative ritual with 8 to12 artists and the public that shows our love and respect for water, as well as our concern for the well-being of H2O--the substance which allows life to flourish on Earth.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Titled the &#8220;Wet Dreams Water Ritual,&#8221; the event is billed as &#8220;an invitation to partake of the pleasures and perils of water--in collaboration with local artists, activists, musicians, sex workers, refugees and other humans and non-humans.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Since its inception in 1955, the city of Kassel in Germany has been the host of Documenta, which takes place every five years and features artists and cultural practitioners from around the globe. This year for the first time, Documenta 14 will take place in Athens, Greece, during 2016, and then in 2017 it will continue at its more traditional location in Germany.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We are thrilled,&#8221; Stephens noted. &#8220; An invitation to be in Documenta is one of the most significant honors that an artist can receive.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/08/3161.html</url><title>Art professor to stage performance art wedding at 2009 Venice Biennale</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="53ab24628072701713dacb13b73df92f"><name>supporting-students-in-distress</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Resources for supporting students in distress</title><summary>We are happy to announce the completion of a mental health handbook for faculty and staff.

<br/>
 Should we welcome the expression of anger in our elections and political deliberations, or does the common good depend on the existence of political institutions and processes from which anger and other strong emotions are excluded?</p>
<p>Has the failure of those institutions and processes prompted much of the acrimony, hostility, and rage that we have witnessed&#8212;or felt&#8212;in this election cycle?<br/>
<br/>
 And is it possible that the theater might shine a light on something important about such questions that we might not discover by other means?<br/>
<br/>
 On the eve of a historic election, the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/event/anger-in-politics/"><em><strong>Institute for Humanities Research</strong></em></a> (IHR) at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;in collaboration with the Humanities research group <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/portfolio/shakespeare-workshop/" title="Shakespeare Workshop"><em><strong>Shakespeare Workshop</strong></em></a>&#8212;will present a public conversation about anger and politics, from Shakespeare to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>It all takes place on Tuesday, October 18, at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz, beginning at 6 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
 Titled <em>Anger in Politics: From the Bard to the Donald,</em> this special event is part of the IHR&#8217;s <strong><em>Questions That Matter</em></strong> series, designed to bring together UC Santa Cruz faculty with community residents and students to explore the big questions that matter to all of us.<br/>
<br/>
 The series is a part of a strategic initiative of the IHR to illustrate the role and value of the humanities in contemporary life.<br/>
<br/>
 The panel will feature <strong>Sean Keilen</strong>, associate professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz, provost of Porter College, and director of Shakespeare Workshop; <strong>Deborah Gould</strong>, a UCSC associate professor of sociology who studies political emotion&#8212;from hope and anger to cynicism, resignation and despair; and <strong>Daniel Wirls</strong>, UCSC professor of politics, and an expert on American politics, institutions, public policy, and political history.<br/>
<br/>
 Keilen explained how the event came about and the connection between anger, Shakespeare, and Donald Trump.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I taught Shakespeare&#8217;s tragedy, <em>Coriolanus</em>,&#160;earlier this year and was struck by how deeply it resonated with students,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;Although Shakespeare was no prophet and could not have foreseen the situation in which we now find ourselves, he is a good companion for thinking about the upcoming election and the pervasive presence of anger in it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <em>Coriolanus&#160;</em>is the only play that Shakespeare set in a republic, Rome, which is under siege by foreign enemies. Because its resources are shared unequally by the upper and lower classes, the Roman Republic is also on the verge of civil war. In this setting, a man named Caius Martius Coriolanus--famous for his prowess as a soldier and infamous for his anger toward the poor--stands for election to Rome's highest office, the consulship.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The question that the play keeps asking is whether the Roman Republic can survive its foreign wars without electing Coriolanus, and whether it can survive Coriolanus's anger if it does elect him,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;To put it another way, Shakespeare's play is about the struggle of a free society to understand its own anger and to define itself as a community during a period of unprecedented instability and disagreement.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Keilen, a former Guggenheim Fellow, who is working on a new book titled <em>Shakespeare and the Future of Literary Education</em>, reflected on the anger he sees in the political arena in 2016.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Speaking only for myself, I believe that the anger permeating public life today is caused by the conspicuously unequal distribution of wealth and privileges in our society; by a succession of governments that have consistently failed to address this inequality; and by news organizations that fetishize trivial celebrity scandals and routinely fail to hold governments accountable for doing nothing to improve the conditions of life and work for everybody,&#8221; said Keilen.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;However, as a teacher and scholar, I would add to this list the significant changes that have occurred, since I was a student, in the way that our society perceives the value and purpose of education,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It is commonplace now to believe that an education is a private commodity rather than a public good, and also that the purpose of education is the accumulation of personal wealth rather than the development of our human capacities for everyone's benefit. Among other things, that means that we are not teaching people to listen to each other; or to appreciate the complexity of different experiences and points of view; or to postpone making judgments and taking action until they have reflected upon a variety of possibilities.&#8220;<br/>
<br/>
 Keilen noted that the anger expressed during this presidential election cycle has been useful to the extent that it clarifies what some of our most persistent problems are, but as one of his students pointed out about&#160;<em>Coriolanus</em>, anger is completely incapable of solving the problems that it brings to the surface. Keilen observed that there are both huge costs and benefits as a result of this anger.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Shakespeare's play suggests that the only way to move past anger toward peaceful relationships is for someone to yield to or to forgive someone else,&#8221; said Keilen.&#160;&#8220;<em>Coriolanus</em>&#160;invites us to ask&#160;what we stand to lose when we give up being angry. It turns out that from Shakespeare's perspective,&#160;the losses that come with yielding--like the gains--are very substantial. Each new audience must decide for itself whether peace is worth the price that Shakespeare says we pay: our anger, and with it the sense of self that anger makes possible.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 But in a world of quick judgments, instant sound bites, rabid opinions, and fierce partisanship, Keilen believes that asking questions about the role of anger in politics really does matter for the future of the country.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I hope that people will be inspired by this event to read, watch, and reflect upon Shakespeare's works in relation to their own circumstances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope that they will have been persuaded of the benefit of the arts and humanities for our shared life in this society. And I hope that they will come to appreciate the complexity of this election cycle and the importance of allowing deep reflection to inform the votes they cast or don't cast.&#8221;<br/>

Detailed Conference Information: 
<p>November 18th-20th, 2016</p>
<p>Hosted at UC Irvine</p>
<p>The Student of Color Conference (SOCC) is the annual University of California Student Association (UCSA) event where members come together to engage and challenge students of color and their allies to address issues of structural and cultural inequalities. SOCC is our oldest and largest conference, providing a safe space for students of color and their allies to strategize around statewide and campus-based actions. The Student of Color Conference can provide a forum for individuals to discuss, explore and educate themselves regarding a wide array of issues affecting people of color. Our primary goal for the conference is to create an inclusive space for community engagement from students of all backgrounds. SOCC can foster a dialogue that critically engages students on issues regarding the School&#173; to &#173;Prison&#173; Pipeline, sexual violence particular facing women, decreased funding to ethnic and LGBT studies departments, and the disquieting trend of hate crimes on University Campuses Statewide.</p>

<p>The Arboretum plant sales are wonderful opportunities to take home some of the dazzling year-round color of the UCSC Arboretum. Whether California natives or plants from Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, they happily grow side-by-side in the Central Coast's Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Hundreds of varieties of spectacular and unique plants are carefully chosen and propagated to conserve California native plants and other beauties bred for drought tolerance and pest control. The fall is the best time to get new plantings established in the garden. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers are on hand to provide expert gardening advice and plant information and to answer questions.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the Arboretum's plant sale is a joint event with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS), offering high-quality, regionally-friendly plants from both groups at great prices and supporting valuable environmental education and conservation efforts.

The endowed chair was established in 2015 with a $500,000 gift from physicist and technology innovator Federico Faggin and matching funds from the UC Regents.</p>
<p>Aguirre said funds from the endowed chair will support projects using information theory to address fundamental questions at the interface of physics and related fields, including cosmology, biophysics, and cognitive science.</p>
<p>"We live in the information age, and while we generally think about physics as being about matter, energy, space, and time, it turns out that in many cases it is also about information," Aguirre said. "Quantum mechanics, our theory of particles, and general relativity, our theory of gravity, both have intimate ties to information theory. Quantum information theory is a major research area and underlies nascent technologies like quantum computing, and many think the mysterious ways that black holes keep and release information hold keys to quantum gravity."</p>
<p>Information theory can also provide a common currency between seemingly disparate topics, he said. Scientists have found that ideas from information theory have applications in a wide range of fields, from cosmology to biology. Aguirre said his research group has been thinking about information in relation to black holes, and has begun working on projects relating information theory to cosmology and other topics.</p>
<p>This work is being done in collaboration with physics professor Josh Deutsch, who specializes in biophysics, and a joint postdoctoral researcher with a background in quantum information theory, as part of a project run by the Foundational Questions Institute. Aguirre is a cofounder of the Foundational Questions Institute, which organized an international conference on the physics of information in 2014.</p>
<p>"I've gotten fascinated by a whole list of questions that go across some of these disciplinary boundaries," Aguirre said. "Can we use theorems proven partly for use in chemistry and biophysics to understand the large-scale structure of the Universe? Or tools from theoretical computer science to inform our understanding of evolution? Maybe! In conjunction with the Foundational Questions Institute project, this endowed chair will help fund meetings and students to nucleate an interdisciplinary group at UCSC and nearby institutions thinking about different aspects of the physics of information and how it might help unify and deepen our understanding of many phenomena."</p>
<p>Aguirre earned his B.S. in mathematics and physics at Brown University and M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy at Harvard University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/faggin-chair.html</url><title>Gift to UC Santa Cruz funds new presidential chair for physics of information</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="71b1fccf8072701713dacb13c7c0311b"><name>guthman-strawberries</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pesticide predicament for California's strawberry growers</title><summary>The powerful fumigant methyl bromide will be retired from California’s strawberry fields at the end of this year after more than 20 years of fierce debate over its effects and alternatives.</summary><start-date>1475082000000</start-date><display-name>Strawberry growers' challenge</display-name><path>/2016/09/guthman-strawberries</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/guthman-strawberries</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1475081271142</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475194522045</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/guthman-julie-2015-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/guthman-julie-2015-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-julie-2015-400.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-julie-2015-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>149795</file-size><width>400</width><height>547</height></image><image-alt>julie guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/strawberries-sign-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/strawberries-sign-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>strawberries-sign-80.jpg</name><display-name>strawberries-sign-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23177</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>danger sign</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor of social sciences Julie Guthman has studied the dilemma of strawberry growers faced with the loss of a powerful fumigant that helps control weeds, and pathogens that affect their lucrative crop.

<p>According to new research published by UC Santa Cruz professor and food studies expert Julie Guthman, these debates often pit the health and well-being of farm workers against the economic viability of growers while overlooking the constraints and availability of farm land.</p>
<p>Guthman has spent the past several years immersed&#8212;literally and figuratively&#8212;in the field to better understand the challenges the strawberry industry faces in a post-methyl bromide world.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;California strawberry growers are in a position in which they have to change a pesticide regime that has served them well,&#8221; Guthman writes in the <em>Journal of Rural Studies</em>. The article reports on part of a larger research project she has conducted with support from the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Methyl bromide's costs and benefits<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Strawberry growers in California have long depended on methyl bromide, the most effective chemical&#160;to control soil-borne pathogens and weeds. Its widespread use has helped make strawberries one of California&#8217;s most lucrative crops. In 2014, annual sales totaled $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>But methyl bromide is also hazardous to humans and the environment. Because of its documented impact on the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol mandated a global phase-out as part of its 1987 pact to reduce ozone-depleting substances. Despite U.S. promises to stop importing and producing the substance, California farmers have long continued its use thanks to what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;critical use exemption (CUE).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lag in developing substitutes<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Because of these exemptions, the California strawberry industry lagged in developing substitutes, Guthman says. Simply put, growers felt they did not need to find alternatives, she writes in a recent issue of <em>California Agriculture</em> that explores the future of the strawberry industry. CUEs gave growers hope that the exemptions would persist. As a result research into less toxic solutions slowed.</p>
<p>For example, one alternative was methyl iodide, a pre-plant fumigant that was developed as a substitute, but became even more controversial than the compound it was meant to replace. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation allowed it on the market despite findings of its own agency scientists that it could result in significant health risks to farm workers and the general population.</p>
<p>Opposition surged. How could the DPR register methyl iodide against its own internal recommendations, opponents charged. &#160;Earthjustice, an environmental law organization, and California Rural Legal Assistance sued the DPR for failing to follow environmental law and be transparent in their decision-making process. Just before a judge was to rule on the dispute, methyl iodide&#8217;s licensee Arystra LifeScience pulled it off the market saying it was no longer economically viable.</p>
<p>Guthman wanted to know why. She discovered that the main reason many farmers didn&#8217;t touch the pesticide was fear of public backlash. In the run-up to the legal proceedings, more than 53,000 people submitted comments contesting the chemical. Farmers feared protesters in their fields and were worried that consumers would not buy berries linked to the pesticide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Activism contributed to the withdrawal of methyl iodide; it scared many shippers and growers into non-adoption and made extension agents and pest-control advisors skeptical of promoting it,&#8221; Guthman says.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives and community health</strong></p>
<p>Other alternatives to methyl bromide still come at a human cost. &#160;Growers are continuing to use chloropicrin, another soil fumigant, which has long been used in combination with methyl bromide. However, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and&#160;the state DPR have designated it a toxic air contaminant. As a result, DPR has recently mandated increased buffer zones, extended waiting periods for tarp removal, and increased monitoring requirements, all to mitigate environmental harm&#160;to the community.</p>
<p>However, as Guthman has argued, these mitigation efforts still fail to adequately protect the lives of farmworkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buffer zones cannot meaningfully protect those who apply the fumigants, work in nearby fields, or work in treated fields post-fumigation,&#8221; writes Guthman.&#160;Neighbors&#8217; lives are privileged over workers, she argues.</p>
<p><strong>What about organics?</strong><br/>
<br/>
 With strawberry growers facing strict regulatory constraints, why not switch from conventional to organic growing practices?<br/>
<br/>
 Guthman says that many growers are experimenting with organics because of the high prices organic strawberries receive in the market. But it is still not an economic option for some.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Transitioning involves avoiding the application of disallowed substances for three years, while not receiving the price premium for organics,&#8221; Guthman writes in her <em>Journal of Rural Studies</em> article.<br/>
<br/>
 Furthermore, agricultural land is costly and scarce, Guthman notes, especially on California&#8217;s central coast where growers compete with developers for prime real estate ideal for growing strawberries.</p>
<p>In short, Guthman finds the strawberry industry is in a real bind. Her next book will explore the historical origins of the predicament and will look at how the factors underwriting the industry&#8217;s success have changed into threats.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucfoodobserver.com/2016/08/16/methyl-bromide-is-out-whats-next-for-californias-strawberry-industry/</url><title>UC Food Observer article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016716301644</url><title>Guthman's article in the 'Journal of Rural Studies'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucanr.edu/repositoryfiles/ca2016a0003-161763.pdf</url><title>California Agriculture: Strawberry growers wavered over methyl iodide,  feared public backlash </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="725a24c08072701713dacb1338a5c1d3"><name>arias</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving voice to the voiceless</title><summary>Andres Arias (Oakes, 2016), a double major in Latin American and Latino studies and sociology,  has immersed himself in California migrant communities to conduct original research about this vulnerable and often voiceless population.</summary><start-date>1475092200000</start-date><display-name>Andres Arias</display-name><path>/2016/09/arias</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/arias</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1475092291424</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475092857922</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/arias-andres-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/arias-andres-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arias-andres-400.jpg</name><display-name>arias-andres-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>216868</file-size><width>400</width><height>567</height></image><image-alt>andres arias</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/arias-andres-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/arias-andres-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arias-andres-80.jpg</name><display-name>arias-andres-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>19422</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>andres arias</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Oakes student Andres Arias immersed himself in California's immigrant communities to research how residents live and work.

<p>Ask UC Santa Cruz student Andres Arias (Oakes, 2016), a double major in Latin American and Latino studies and sociology. Arias has immersed himself in California migrant communities to conduct original research about this vulnerable and often voiceless population.</p>
<p>Aries will present some of these findings at &#8220;No Place Like Home, The Santa Cruz Affordable Housing Crisis Study,&#8221; a public event Oct. 13 at the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz. The research, led by sociology professors Miriam Greenberg and Steve McKay, grows out of &#8220;<a href="http://workingfordignity.ucsc.edu/">Working for Dignity</a>,&#8221; McKay&#8217;s previous study about low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p><strong>Working for dignity</strong></p>
<p>From Santa Cruz to Los Angeles, Arias explored issues surrounding migrant work with an emphasis on low-wage jobs and the informal labor market.</p>
<p>His interest in labor studies began in 2015 through a research apprenticeship with McKay. At the time, McKay was spearheading his two-year Working for Dignity study in collaboration with the Center for Labor Studies, the Chicano Latino Research Center, California Rural Legal Assistance, and the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County Day Worker Center.</p>
<p>Every weekend, Arias would travel with fellow undergraduates across Santa Cruz County to interview subjects for the project. Often driving the 15-passenger van himself, Arias and fellow undergraduate researchers visited farmer's markets, public events and plazas, grocery stores, and coin laundries. At times they went&#160; door-to-door to talk with low-wage and undocumented workers about their working conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Personal connections</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There was an instant connection with the person I would interview,&#8221; Arias remembers.</p>
<p>Like many of his research subjects, Arias was raised in a low-income household and knows first-hand the problems associated with low-wage work.</p>
<p>Like many of his research subjects, Arias is also undocumented.</p>
<p>Arias is one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Dreamers, a group of undocumented students who can attend college thanks to California Dream Act. The act is a combination of three bills, AB 540, AB 130 and AB 131 that allow undocumented students who meet certain requirements to be treated the same as resident students.</p>
<p>When Arias was seven years old, he emigrated from Mexico with his family. His parents pieced together low-wage shift work, often working opposite schedules to make ends meet in their new home in the San Francisco Bay Area. Arias&#8217; mother was a janitor on the night shift who started at 6 p.m. and finished at 3 in the morning. Meanwhile, his father often worked two jobs, doing 12-hour shifts at a warehouse from 4 a.m. to dusk</p>
<p>&#8220;Informal labor is part of my family,&#8221; says Arias.</p>
<p>Job insecurity, wage theft, tip stealing, no break times, harassment, discrimination, and even retaliation against workers who spoke out about poor and unsafe working conditions were some of the many problems Arias and other researchers discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andres is an ideal student for our community-based research projects,&#8221; McKay said.&#160; &#8220;His own background and experiences have made our data collection, and our research, simply better.&#160; From driving our van full of students to Watsonville, to being able to connect with local residents and draw out their stories, Andres has really done it all.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Senior thesis: The Migrant Metropolis</strong></p>
<p>In McKay&#8217;s class, Arias developed the skills required to conduct his own research about Latino street vendors in Los Angeles.&#160; He wanted to know more about the impact of L.A.&#8217;s strict anti-street-vending regulations. Despite laws against this type of work, he discovered that migrant Latinos continue to sell consumable foods from metal grocery pushcarts.</p>
<p>&#8220;What my work aims to engage is the dignity street vendors find in so-called &#8216;illegal work&#8217; they perform in public spaces in the city,&#8221; he writes in his senior thesis on the project.</p>
<p>To learn more, Arias embedded himself for six weeks with the community to learn about the risks and vulnerabilities of selling homemade churros, fruit cups, corn on the cob, and shaved ice with flavored syrup&#8212;all illegal work, according to city regulations.</p>
<p>Arias observed vendors&#8217; fear of being arrested, high debt, and social danger. He heard stories of private security firms causing terror and an elderly woman robbed of her earnings at the end of a day.</p>
<p><strong>Back on the street</strong></p>
<p>He even witnessed a police crackdown on an older woman selling slices of fruit&#8212;a moment that defined his research project. After the police took the seller&#8217;s pushcart and product away, Arias followed her to see what she did next. Instead of seeking consolation that he had expected, she sought out new street vending supplies and started over, even returning to the same spot later that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This vignette reveals the questions at the heart of this research project: under this punitive environment, what is the moral economy of informal street vendors?&#8221; Arias noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andres Arias has really excelled,&#8221; said Pablo Reguerin, assistant vice provost for student success and director of the Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP). Reguerin observed Andres successfully advance in the EOP Pathways to Research (P2R) Program where he worked with him as a mentor.</p>
<p>Arias&#8217; perseverance and scholarship has earned him the The Fanny Carruthers Award in Sociology two years in a row. This summer, Arias was also invited to present his research in Seattle at the American Sociological Association&#8217;s Honors Program for undergraduate students.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Andres is an example of the power of giving students an equal opportunity to succeed,&#8221; Reguerin said.</p>

<p>The UC Santa Cruz Science Education &amp; Mentorship In Latino Lives in Academia (SEMILLA) Project, based in the campus&#8217;s <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu">Division of Student Success</a>, will enable the campus to create a comprehensive set of interventions&#8212;guided by analysis and research teams&#8212;to support students in clearing the barriers they face inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confronting the equity challenges at UC Santa Cruz is essential for our institutional success, and it will require partnerships, collective thinking, and action from everyone in our larger campus community,&#8221; Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success Pablo Reguerin said. &#8220;We are excited to build upon the strengths of our campus and students and not follow a path of deficit-thinking which is far too common in public education.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 30 percent of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s undergraduates are Latino, and about 40 percent of undergraduates are from low-income families.</p>
<p>Majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are among the most popular for all UC Santa Cruz students, including Latino and low-income students. As students begin undergraduate coursework in mathematics, chemistry, biology and computer programming, achievement disparities emerge for Latino, underrepresented, and low-income students, said Reguerin. This often results in Latino and low-income students dropping their STEM major for a different field, an outcome that adversely impacts the U.S. economy, social mobility, and opportunities for students of color.</p>
<p>The SEMILLA project is designed to break attrition patterns and social reproduction rooted in both the under-preparation of students and the under-preparation of UC Santa Cruz to serve Latino and low-income STEM students, Reguerin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can meet these challenges&#8212;interrupting STEM attrition patterns and building permanent institutional strength in this area&#8212;we will contribute to a better UC system and a better California, empowered by upward social mobility for all, and capable of defeating a two-track educational system based on patterns of class and racial social reproduction,&#8221; Professor Juan Poblete said.</p>
<p>The grant was awarded to Reguerin, Poblete, and John Tamkun, professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. The group collaborated with a team of faculty and student support staff at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Through the five-year grant, UC Santa Cruz will conduct an equity analysis; establish a STEM Learning Center; expand academic support programs including Learning Support Services, ACE Academic Excellence Program, the Engineering Summer Bridge program and Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP); offer faculty professional development; design a seminar-style College Math Academy; provide holistic STEM counseling; create new programming to foster a sense of belonging, and much more.</p>
<p>The project aims to reduce by 20 percent the number of Latino and and low-income students who switch to a non-STEM major. Additionally, the campus will work toward a 10 percent increase in the number of Latino and low-income STEM students who graduate in six years or less.</p>
<p>The project will also support transfer students. The campus hopes to boost the number of Latino and low-income STEM transfers by 20 percent and increase the three-year graduation rate by 20 percent. SEMILLA will partner with local community colleges, many of which have also received <a href="http://farr.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1268-farr-announces-27-5-million-for-central-coast-colleges-and-universities">HSI awards from the federal government</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html">was awarded two grants</a> from the U.S. Department of Education, totaling $3.6 million, to help the campus increase achievement for Latinos and all students on campus, as well as partner with San Jose City College to help transfer students earn their bachelor&#8217;s degrees at a research university.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we increase equity and broaden opportunities at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Reguerin said, &#8220;we build a better institution&#8212;more capable of educating a diverse community of students to serve our state, country and world.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="72dd87858072701713dacb13dff8aa75"><name>cultural-competency-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cultural competency training aims to help foster an inclusive culture</title><summary>For the past eight years, Diversity and Inclusion Program Coordinator Donnae Smith has been delivering a training to students to help them support the difficult conversations that can come when students from a variety of backgrounds come together in an intimate, college environment.</summary><keywords>campus community, inclusion, diversity</keywords><start-date>1475100000000</start-date><display-name>Campus community</display-name><path>/2016/09/cultural-competency-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/cultural-competency-students</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1475100902003</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475165068064</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kara Guzman</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/evan-kaitlin-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/evan-kaitlin-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>evan-kaitlin-500px.jpg</name><display-name>evan-kaitlin-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>193873</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>students together</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/evan-kaitlin-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/evan-kaitlin-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>evan-kaitlin-80px.jpg</name><display-name>evan-kaitlin-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12727</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students together</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Kaitlin Tannyhill and Evan Blank, both RAs at Porter College, were among the several hundred students who took the campus's cultural competency traning taught by <span id="docs-internal-guid-488bbf2d-72dc-43ad-f35e-4fb1e3a5d523"><span>Diversity and Inclusion Program coordinator Donnae Smith.

<p>Smith, UC Santa Cruz's Diversity and Inclusion Program coordinator, shared her story with around 325 residence hall staff members this month, as part of an annual cultural competency training for residence assistants (RAs), who are also student leaders within the campus's ten residential colleges.</p>
<p>"There's a music, a language, a culture that comes with a place," Smith tells students.</p>
<p>And your experiences and your culture&#8212;the people who raised you, or "loved you up," as Smith puts it&#8212;shapes how you see others, she said.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, Smith has been delivering a training to students to help them support the difficult conversations that can come when students from a variety of backgrounds come together in an intimate, college environment. The four-hour workshop was held with students at all 10 resident colleges.</p>
<p>The focus of the training is influenced by the national landscape, as well as the campus's needs, Smith said. A survey last year showed that black students feel less welcome than other racial groups on campus. Due to the survey, and police shootings across the nation of unarmed black people and the Black Lives Matter movement, Smith decided to shift the focus of this year's training.</p>
<p>"You're not born a racist. You're not born a sexist. You're not born homophobic. You learn all of that," she said. "And when you realize that, you're unlearning that and you're replacing it with what's right."</p>
<p>RAs began with an online test for implicit bias, administered by Harvard University, which measured for a "preference" for white or black people, based on a timed word and photo association assessment. Results were confidential, and meant to raise awareness of any unconscious bias.</p>
<p>Students watched videos on race, including one on the history of suburbia, and how Italian- and Irish-American soldiers escaped the ghettos after World War II, due to home loans that were denied to African American soldiers because of their race. Smith led discussions about gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, and how those identities shape others' views and give power and privilege.</p>
<p>The real lesson, Smith says, was showing students how to have these discussions.</p>
<p>"You need to see where the hope lies around these issues of difference, and in particular with these dialogues around race, which in this country we are told we can't have without it leading to fisticuffs," Smith said. "And there is a way to do that, and I can help you do that. There's an attitude, a value you have to bring with you to that conversation. There are certain things you need to check in your responses and your triggers, and know who you are and know your issues."</p>
<p>Kaitlin Tannyhill, a senior majoring in business management and economics and RA in Porter College, says the training taught her to take each relationship on a "case by case basis."</p>
<p>Tannyhill said she's biracial, but "passes" as white and hasn't dealt with discrimination.</p>
<p>"It's bad to say to someone who's black, 'Oh, how should I talk to black people?" Tannyhill says. "I think it's more important to say, 'Oh, how can I talk to you about this?' or 'How can I be an ally to you?'"</p>
<p>Saying otherwise creates a separation, she says.</p>
<p>"It makes it seem like you're distinguishing even more, rather than talking to them like they're a person with an identity who wants to be respected," she said.</p>
<p>Evan Blank, a junior and computer science major who is also an RA in Porter College, said he learned that sometimes people say offensive things without realizing it.</p>
<p>"You have to separate the action from the person, and when you do that, also separate the person from the group," Blank says. "If you're talking to one African American person, that's not a representation of all African American people, you know?"</p>
<p>Discussions about the police shootings, for example, often end with someone getting upset.</p>
<p>"A big part of fixing that problem is trying to inform people on the difference between people and their opinions, and so just because people have an opinion doesn't mean that they are that thing," Blank said. "So I think that's one of the main things people should focus on. Once they do that, people will actually start to listen to each other."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="771ceb988072701713dacb13a252fca5"><name>algal-bloom</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ocean conditions contributed to unprecedented 2015 toxic algal bloom</title><summary>A new study connects the unprecedented West Coast toxic algae bloom of 2015 to the unusually warm ocean conditions.</summary><keywords>Raphael Kudela, toxic algae, domoic acid, the blob</keywords><start-date>1475132400000</start-date><display-name>Ocean conditions contributed to unprecedented 2015 toxic algal bloom</display-name><path>/2016/09/algal-bloom</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/algal-bloom</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1475172165034</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475172813347</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Hannah Hickey, UW</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/domoic-acid-map-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/domoic-acid-map-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>domoic-acid-map-500.jpg</name><display-name>domoic-acid-map-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>128617</file-size><width>500</width><height>441</height></image><image-alt>domoic acid map</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/domoic-acid-map-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/domoic-acid-map-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>domoic-acid-map-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>domoic-acid-map-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20888</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>domoic acid map</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This map shows impacts of the 2015 West Coast toxic algal bloom (<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/images/domoic-acid-map.jpg">see larger image here</a>).

Wingert/SFSU)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new study connects the unprecedented West Coast toxic algae bloom of 2015 that closed fisheries from southern California to northern British Columbia to the unusually warm ocean conditions &#8212; nicknamed "the blob" &#8212; in winter and spring of that year.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ocean scientist Raphael Kudela contributed to the study, which was accepted for publication in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> and is <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070023/full">available online</a>.</p>
<p>"We have toxic algae events that result in shellfish closures off the Washington and Oregon coast every three to five years or so, but none of them have been as large as this one," said lead author Ryan McCabe, a research scientist at the University of Washington&#8217;s Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean in Seattle. "This one was entirely different, and our results show that it was connected to the unusual ocean conditions."</p>
<p>"This paper is significant because it identifies a link between ocean conditions and the magnitude of the toxic bloom in 2015 that resulted in the highest levels of domoic acid contamination in the food web ever recorded for many species," said coauthor Kathi Lefebvre, a marine biologist at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. "This is an eye-opener for what the future may hold as ocean conditions continue to warm globally."</p>
<p>The authors found the 2015 harmful algal bloom, which set records for its spatial extent and the level of toxicity, was dominated by a single species of diatom, <em>Pseudo-nitzschia australis</em>, normally found farther south off California.</p>
<p>"This species is almost always highly toxic," said Kudela, the Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz. "It blooms every spring off California, and there are frequently marine mammal impacts. But to see <em>P. australis</em> up and down the coast like this was unprecedented."</p>
<p><strong>Favorable environment</strong></p>
<p>Warm water not only allowed this species to survive, it also created an environment favoring its growth. By early 2015 the warm "blob" had moved toward shore and spread all along the West Coast. Warmer water creates less dense surface water that is more likely to stay floating on the surface, where it can become depleted in nutrients.</p>
<p>Previous laboratory studies by coauthor William Cochlan of San Francisco State University showed <em>P. australis</em> can take up nitrogen very quickly from a variety of sources, and appear to outcompete other, nontoxic phytoplankton in nutrient-depleted warm water.</p>
<p>For the new study, Cochlan's lab performed experiments with <em>P. australis</em> from the 2015 bloom. They showed when these cells experience warmer temperatures and get more nutrients they can double or triple their cell division rates, allowing them to potentially bloom into a large population fairly quickly at sea.</p>
<p>"When springtime shifts in wind direction brought deeper, nutrient-rich water upward near the coast, a small population of <em>P. australis</em> became a big population, which was then washed ashore along the West Coast by late spring storms," said coauthor Barbara Hickey, a professor of oceanography at the University of Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Domoic acid</strong></p>
<p>Toxic algae come in many forms, but off the West Coast the major health and economic threat comes from various <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> species which can, under certain conditions, produce domoic acid, which can cause gastrointestinal distress, seizures, memory loss and even death.</p>
<p>Toxins can accumulate in razor clams and mussels, making them unsafe for human consumption. But the effects in the ecosystem are more widespread and long-lasting. Shellfish and anchovies containing toxins can get eaten by marine mammals and birds. If toxic algae settle to the ocean floor, they also can get eaten by bottom-dwelling animals like crabs, which then become unsafe to eat.</p>
<p>In late May 2015, a sea lion was found convulsing on a Washington beach, and domoic acid was identified in its feces.</p>
<p>"That's something we'd never seen before in Washington, and when we heard this news we knew something huge was going on," said coauthor Vera Trainer, a research oceanographer at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;NOAA cruise</strong></p>
<p>That year saw the largest geographic extent of marine mammal impacts ever recorded. A NOAA-led cruise in June 2015 sampled water from southern California up to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The new study includes those observations, collected near the end of the Washington bloom, as well as other ongoing beach monitoring and water sampling efforts that filter seawater to see the life it contains.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center examined the water samples under a high-resolution scanning electron microscope to identify the species present.</p>
<p>"As we started getting more and more of the samples that coincided with the peaks in the razor clam toxicity, it was quite clear that <em>P. australis</em> was the dominant species all along the coast," Trainer said.</p>
<p>State resource managers have been collecting shellfish to monitor for toxins for decades. Kudela's lab conducts regular monitoring in Monterey Bay. Farther north, samples collected by the Olympic Region Harmful Algal Blooms Partnership and other efforts have also contributed to a 25-year record of toxic algae events.</p>
<p>The new paper compares the history of toxins in razor clams to indices of ocean climate variability, and finds a connection with El Ni&#241;o and the longer-term Pacific Decadal Oscillation.</p>
<p>"There's a significant connection there," McCabe said. "The toxic events also tend to coincide with previously established marine ecosystem shifts. We had not made that connection before, and I think it's fascinating."</p>
<p>Ocean climate cycles could help understand and better predict the emergence of toxic algal blooms. And while the blob was a one-time event that was not due to global warming, it provides a window into what climate change might look like.</p>
<p>"Species like <em>Pseudo-nitzchia</em> are extremely well-poised to take advantage of background warming," McCabe said. "<em>Pseudo-nitzchia</em> are always out there along our coast. The fact that they are almost engineered to take advantage of situations like this &#8212; warm temperatures and low nutrients &#8212; that is concerning."</p>
<p>He recommends more monitoring of harmful algal blooms, through collecting shellfish and water samples on the coast and offshore to see whether toxins or toxin-producing algae are present, and if so, which species.</p>
<p>"Without stably funded programs like that, we're just going to be blind," McCabe said.</p>
<p>The research was primarily funded by NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research.

A total of 38 incidents, including 18 reports of bicycle thefts, four burglaries, as well as several reported laptop, backpack, and wallet thefts have occurred from Sept. 12 to today. These thefts have occurred at locations throughout the campus and appear to be crimes of opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with information regarding who may be responsible for these thefts is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department immediately. The community is also encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity or persons by dialing 911 or 831-459-2231, ext. 1.<br/>
<br/>
Report all in-progress crimes by calling 911 from any landline or cell phone. Reports may also be made by using one of the many "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Safety Tips</strong><br/>
No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.<br/>
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Report all suspicious persons, in-progress crimes, and emergencies to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Whenever possible, please remember to lock your vehicle and residence doors. Keep valuables secured and out of sight.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.</p>

 <br/>
 The longtime co-director of the UC Santa Cruz creative writing program explained how she came up with the idea of having twin fetuses narrate the story.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I originally wanted a big storytelling voice, but I didn't want the voice to be anonymous,&#8221; Perks recalled. &#8220;I liked the idea of this big, Whitmanesque voice coming from a tiny being inside the main character--a little like the position of the author.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I love twins, and I love all the utopian possibilities with twins,&#8221; she added.&#160; &#8220;And the &#8216;we&#8217; voice now seems essential to what the book is about: the tension between individual desires and the desire for community.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 It took Perks nearly a decade to complete the novel, all the while teaching and serving as a provost on campus, and raising four kids at home. She admitted that there are some similarities between her own life experience and the characters in her book.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Evie, the main character, moves west to east, from Santa Cruz to rural New York state. I did the opposite. I grew up on a commune, and Evie finds herself in a communal situation. I've been pregnant, Evie's pregnant. My beloved is a Chilean man who loves books and has a killer smile. Evie is in love with a Chilean man who loves books and has a killer smile. So I definitely take things from my own life, but everything gets distorted, pulled and pushed in service to the novel,&#8221; said Perks.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It's so interesting, when I write memoir, many people ask me, is it all really true?&#8221; she added. &#8220;They want to know what I &#8216;made up&#8217;. And when I write fiction, people want to know what's true. People have anxiety about or interest in genre, genre slippage or blurriness.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 Warm, quirky, hilarious, and written in an artfully inventive style, <em>What Becomes Us</em> is a surprising novel. Excerpts of the book earned Perks a National Endowment for the Arts grant and won the <em>New Guard</em> Machigonne 2014 Fiction Prize. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perks&#8217; previous works include a novel, <em>We Are Gathered Here</em>; a memoir, <em>Pagan Time</em>, and a long personal essay, <em>Alone in the Woods: Cheryl Strayed, My Daughter and Me</em>. Her short stories and essays have won five Pushcart Prize nominations, and her work has appeared in anthologies and journals such as <em>Epoch, Zyzzyva, Tin House, The Toast,</em> and <em>The Rumpus</em>. <br/>
 <br/>
 She will celebrate the publish date of the book with a free public reading on Tuesday, October 4, at Bookshop Santa Cruz. She then embarks on a regional tour that includes appearances in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sausalito. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perks will also read on campus as part of the UC Santa Cruz Living Writers series this winter quarter. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I hope people are captivated by the story and the music in the language,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;A couple of people told me they cried at the end. A few people told me it made them laugh. That makes me really happy. I definitely have a feminist agenda. I think that's obvious.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="783d9cd58072701713dacb131d539c2f"><name>green-citl-appointment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jody Greene appointed founding director of Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</title><summary>Jody Greene, professor of literature, feminist studies, and history of consciousness, has been appointed the founding director of the new Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL).</summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, citl</keywords><start-date>1475191500000</start-date><display-name>Jody Greene appointed founding director of CITL</display-name><path>/2016/09/green-citl-appointment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/green-citl-appointment</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1475191084858</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475191526801</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value><value>History of Consciousness</value><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/jody-greene-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/jody-greene-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jody-greene-300.jpg</name><display-name>jody-greene-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>109340</file-size><width>300</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Jody Greene</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/09/images/jody-greene-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/09/images/jody-greene-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jody-greene-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jody-greene-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23726</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jody Greene</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jody Greene</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jody Greene, professor of literature, feminist studies, and history of consciousness, has been appointed the founding director of the new Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL).</p>
<p>In addition to her 18 years of teaching experience at UC Santa Cruz, Greene also has experience teaching others to be teachers in a variety of contexts, from yoga to wilderness expeditions. She has won three teaching awards and a Disability Resource Center award of recognition while at UC Santa Cruz, and has been a leader on campus in the practice of contemplative pedagogy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to have Jody leading the CITL, with her depth of experience, her demonstrated record of teaching excellence, and her desire to help others teach effectively,&#8221; said Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee. An area of particular interest for her is helping our faculty adapt to the changing demographics of our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The student body is quite different from when many faculty were hired in the past few decades, and understanding how to adapt teaching practices can make faculty more effective and the learning a better experience for the students,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There is an increasing amount of research on teaching effectiveness from which all instructors can benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CITL is planned to be a resource and support center for the teaching mission of the campus, supporting all faculty and graduate students. New faculty often arrive with little training in teaching. Faculty who have been at UC Santa Cruz for a while may need help re-tooling to take advantage of new technologies, or to adapt to the changing student demographics.</p>
<p>Graduate students teaching at UC Santa Cruz, or planning to embark on teaching careers, will benefit from training, and the CITL plans to partner with the Graduate Division to create training, possibly as a certificate program, for graduate students in the areas of classroom climate and the effective use of learning technologies.</p>
<p>Areas of support will include instruction, assessment of learning, and classroom cultural competence. Greene will oversee a staff of a full-time assistant director, a half-time instructional designer, and several students. The CITL is located with the Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC) on the first floor of McHenry Library.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="784df38e8072701713dacb1300d2d940"><name>in-memoriam-madeline-halluin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Madeline Halluin</title><summary>Madeline Halluin graduated in spring 2016 with a bachelor of arts in sociology and a bachelor of arts in film and digital media with a concentration in general film and digital media.</summary><start-date>1475164800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Madeline Halluin</display-name><path>/2016/09/in-memoriam-madeline-halluin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/in-memoriam-madeline-halluin</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1475192155710</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1475192657356</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is with deep sadness that we write to tell you of the death of recent Stevenson College graduate, Madeline Halluin.

<h2>Information about registered sex offenders</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, institutions of higher education must annually provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.</p>
<p>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff's department. For the UC Santa Cruz campus, information on registered sex offenders is available at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, <a href="tel:831-454-2242" value="+18314542242">831-454-2242</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides for the tracking of convicted sex offenders enrolled at or employed at institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>California Penal Code &#167;290.01 requires sex offenders who are enrolled as a student, or is, with or without compensation, a full-time or part-time employee, or is carrying on a vocation for more than 14 days, or for an aggregate period exceeding 30 days in a calendar year to register with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of commencing enrollment or employment. The terms "employed or carries on a vocation" include employment whether or not financially compensated, volunteered, or performed for government or educational benefit. The registrant shall also notify the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of ceasing to be enrolled or employed, or ceasing to carry on a vocation.</p>
<p>Information on these registered sex offenders is available to the public at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. Access to the data is by appointment only. Information on registered sex offenders is also available on the&#160;<a href="http://meganslaw.ca.gov">Megan's Law website</a>.</p>

<h2>California mandatory reporting laws</h2>
<p>As outlined by Penal Code &#167;368 and Welfare and Institutions Code &#167;15600 et al., the California Legislature enacted recent laws to require elderly and dependent adult care custodians, health practitioners, Adult Protective Services staff, law enforcement, and other designated agencies to report and to investigate incidents of abuse/neglect. The categories of abuse and neglect that must be reported by mandated parties now include: physical, sexual, financial, isolation, abandonment, abduction, neglect, mental suffering, and self-neglect.</p>
<p>California Penal Code &#167;11160 requires prompt, mandatory reporting to the local law enforcement agency by healthcare practitioners (such as those at the Cowell Student Health Center) when they provide medical services to a person they know or reasonably suspect is suffering from wounds inflicted by a firearm or as a result of assaultive or abusive conduct.</p>
<p>The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act (CANRA), codified in California Penal Code &#167;&#167;11164-11174.3, requires that employers of mandated reporters (as defined in the Act) promote identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect. It is the policy of the University of California to comply with its obligations under the Act; to require that all university employees and administrators who are mandated reporters make required reports to child protection or law enforcement agencies; and, more broadly, to encourage all members of the university community who observe, have actual knowledge of, or reasonably suspect child abuse or neglect at a university facility or perpetrated by university personnel to promptly report the concern to appropriate law enforcement, external officials and university officials. More information about the University of California CANRA Policy can be found at: <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/CANRA">policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/<wbr/>CANRA</a>.</p>
<h2>Student Safety Bill (AB 1433)&#160;</h2>
<p>Pursuant to California Education Code &#160;&#167;&#167;67380(a)(6)(A), 67381 and 67383(a), the UC Santa Cruz Police Department must report immediately or as soon as practicably possible to the appropriate local law enforcement agency, all reports received by a campus security authority (CSA) of any Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, committed on or off campus. This includes reports victims make directly to CSAs as well as reports victims make to other University employees that are then conveyed to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department or other CSAs.</p>
<p>Such reports will include, when the victim has consented to being identified:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and characteristics of the victim;&#160;</li>
<li>The name and characteristics of the perpetrator if known;&#160;</li>
<li>Description of the incident, including location and date and time; and&#160;</li>
<li>Any report number assigned to the police incident report documenting the investigation being conducted by the jurisdictional agency.</li>

A new study focusing on a different type of brain cell, the glial cells known as astrocytes, indicates they also are impaired by the genetic defect and are involved in the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>Scientists are eager for new insights into fragile X syndrome since the failure in 2014 of two large clinical trials of drugs designed to treat the disease. Both drugs are inhibitors of a neurotransmitter pathway thought to be overactive in the brains of people with fragile X syndrome. The new findings, reported in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.08.036">paper accepted for publication in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em></a>, may not explain the failure of those drugs to alleviate symptoms of the disease, but they do suggest that researchers need to look beyond neuronal effects to fully understand it.</p>
<p>"The clinical trials were a big disappointment because the drugs had been effective in animal models of fragile X syndrome. But if you compare humans to mice, we have a much higher ratio of astrocytes to neurons in our brains, so the effects on astrocytes may be more important in humans," said Yi Zuo, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the new study.</p>
<p>Glial cells were originally thought of as simply the "glue" that holds the neurons together in the brain, but they are now known to have a wide variety of important functions. Astrocytes, the most numerous glial cells, greatly outnumber neurons in the human brain and play crucial roles in neuronal functions and in the formation and stability of synapses (the connections between neurons).</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Synapse formation</strong></p>
<p>Synapse formation is significantly affected by fragile X syndrome, with both human and animal studies showing abnormal development of "dendritic spines," the neuronal structures that form synapses. The syndrome is caused by a genetic defect on the X chromosome that knocks out production of a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a negative regulator of protein synthesis that affects the expression of many different proteins.</p>
<p>Zuo, whose research focuses on synapse formation during learning, looked at the influence of FMRP on this process using a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. FMRP is normally expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Zuo's lab developed mice in which FMRP was either selectively deleted or exclusively expressed in astrocytes, then tracked the development of dendritic spines on neurons in the brains of these mice and tested their ability to learn new skills.</p>
<p>The results showed that eliminating FMRP only in astrocytes led to abnormal development of dendritic spines as well as impaired learning of motor skills. But if FMRP was expressed only in astrocytes and not in neurons, spine development and learning ability were still abnormal.</p>
<p>"You need FMRP in both neurons and astrocytes for normal development of synapses," Zuo explained.</p>
<p>The study also showed that loss of the FMRP protein causes an increase in spine formation during adolescence and less "pruning" of synapses during later development. As a result, adult mice lacking FMRP have an overabundance of dendritic spines, which is also seen in humans with fragile X syndrome.</p>
<p>"In future studies, we want to look at the molecular mechanisms involved in these observations," Zuo said. "We are just beginning to recognize the importance of glial cells in neural development and neurological diseases. Astrocytes are very difficult to manipulate and study, so there is still a lot we do not understand."</p>

<p>A generous gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation is making this possible. The naming of the college&#8212;our first in 35 years&#8212;honors Carson, whose 1962 book <em>Silent Spring</em> exposed the devastating environmental impacts of DDT and inspired the modern-day environmental movement. Rachel Carson College will be the first college at UC Santa Cruz to bear a woman's name.</p>
<p>The campus will host a public dedication on Thursday, October 6, at noon in the Rachel Carson College courtyard. I hope you will join me for the celebration.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is well known for pioneering environmental research that advances ecological protection. This gift has added meaning in light of our role saving the peregrine falcon, which was on the brink of extinction caused by DDT. I want to thank Claudia and Alec Webster (Rachel Carson College [formerly College Eight] '02), stewards of the Webster Foundation, who worked closely with Provost Ronnie Lipschutz to honor the campus's legacy and Rachel Carson's historic contributions.</p>
<p>The gift funds an endowment for the college that will support research and educational opportunities for students. It is part of a $7 million package focused on the environment that establishes faculty chairs in ecology and environmental justice, and in science communication. Mark Headley (Stevenson '83) and Christina Pehl are major donors to the project, as well; UC Office of the President contributed matching funds to the faculty chairs.

<p>This is an exciting day for the campus and an important milestone in the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz. I am delighted that our partners in philanthropy are choosing to build on our achievements in ways that will benefit today's students&#8212;and tomorrow's.

<p>To students who are new to the campus, welcome. You made an excellent choice. This university is an extraordinary place to pursue your interests&#8212;and discover new ones. You will learn from and work alongside leading faculty. Our setting can't be beat, recreational opportunities are plentiful, and you will make lifelong friends.</p>
<p>I'm delighted to begin the year with two new campus leaders in place: <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/engineering-dean.html">Engineering Dean Alexander Wolf</a> and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/arts-dean-solt.html">Arts Dean Susan Solt</a>. They join a total of 39 new faculty who are arriving across all five academic divisions this year, a tremendous infusion of people with new energy, ideas, and expertise.</p>
<p>For those of you living on campus, you have probably noticed that we converted most residence hall lounges to bedrooms this year. Losing these spaces to study and hang out is a hardship. We are moving forward this fall with a proposal to renovate existing housing and add new housing on the west side of campus. Easing overcrowding is a top priority.</p>
<p>Please know that we are dedicated to your success. If you need assistance or support, do reach out and ask for it. Resources are available, and faculty and staff are eager to contribute to your success.</p>
<p>To returning students, faculty, and staff, welcome back. This promises to be an exciting year. Later this month, we will dedicate the UC Santa Cruz Center in Silicon Valley, followed on October 6 with the public dedication of Rachel Carson College.</p>
<p>Naming a college is a big deal; we haven't done it since Porter College more than 35 years ago. Rachel Carson literally changed the world with her insights into the effects of DDT and other pesticides on the environment and her expos&#233; of corporate influence. On this campus--known for its natural beauty and commitment to environmental stewardship--honoring her legacy feels like honoring a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>If you haven't read Carson's book <em>Silent Spring</em>, I encourage you to pick it up. And if you haven't heard about the critical role UC Santa Cruz played in saving the peregrine falcon from DDT-related extinction, much of that proud history is available online; <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/98-99/09-07/peregrine.htm">a good overview is here</a>.</p>
<p>This campus is on the move, with much to celebrate.

Both of his parents studied art at Stanford University; his mother, Betsy Franco, is a well-known author of teen and young adult books, and both of his brothers, James Franco and Dave Franco, are famous actors. &#8220;We did art projects with my mom,&#8221; says Tom. &#8220;My parents never told us what to do or how to do it. There were always creative things going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a UC Santa Cruz alumnus (Porter 2002), Tom is part of the 50th year celebration and is currently teaching Curatorial Practice at the Sesnon Gallery with Shelby Graham, Lecturer and Director of the Senson Gallery, incorporating his CoLab approach to art. The class has been a wonderful success and the gallery has been filled with vibrant, life-sized self-portraits painted by the students. Open mic events, performance collectives, discussions and mural painting have been part of the ongoing process as well, and Tom has invited many artists who are UC Santa Cruz alumni members to perform.</p>
<p>Tom recalls being excited by illustrations and clay sculptures he did as a child and being encouraged by his teachers. He and his older brother, James, also went through a comic book phase and drew action figures together. But it wasn&#8217;t until Tom was in high school that the idea of becoming a bona fide artist really struck him as possible. &#8220;I remember being in school and the teacher was very stimulating, talking about what he did and he&#8217;d bring us on studio tours. We&#8217;d meet his friends and also his teachers. We got to go Manuel Neri&#8217;s studio. You can&#8217;t get bigger than Manuel Neri as a sculptor!&#8221;</p>
<p>One teacher in particular, Bill Iaculla, whose work revolves around using found objects along with clay, inspired Tom to delve into a new medium. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t see that kind of art before,&#8221; explains Tom. &#8220;But something in my brain said I could make it. I really liked it. Bill was an example for me of an adult doing what I wanted to.&#8221; Tom also remembers when he and James started taking life drawing classes through a community art program and how their father, Doug, encouraged them to keep going. &#8220;Life drawing was a big deal and we were young teenagers in a class with naked models, so it was awkward,&#8221; laughs Tom. &#8220;My dad was a fanatical life drawer. He wouldn&#8217;t just do it -- he would overdo it! He had this fanatical art side that I also see in James, and he was obsessed with at least five subjects, so I definitely think that James got a lot of that from Doug, too.&#8221; (Doug died suddenly in 2011 but had started drawing again during the last year of his life.)</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s mother, Betsy, provided a balance to the obsessive side of art making since she channeled her creativity into writing and had a more methodical approach to her work. &#8220;Once James was born, my mom didn&#8217;t have enough time for her art so she turned to writing,&#8221; says Tom. &#8220;She was always writing and she always had crafty things for us to do like collages.&#8221; To date, Betsy has written scores of books for teens as well as scholastic readers that use games and projects to teach basic skills, picture books, edited anthologies of poetry by teens, and more recently, her first book for adults called&#160;<em>Naked</em>&#160;with illustrations by Tom, which has recently been optioned as film. She and Tom, as well as the entire family, have a warm, close relationship and she regularly attends his shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to go to UC Santa Cruz because it&#8217;s such a beautiful campus,&#8221; says Tom. &#8220;I was an art major but I didn&#8217;t want to go to an art school per se because I didn&#8217;t want to just do art. I wanted to learn on a much broader range.&#8221; Before attending UC Santa Cruz, Tom was accepted into the very prestigious California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA) at CalArts, which is a rigorous, pre-professional training program in visual arts that only takes top students. &#8220;It was amazing. There were various disciplines interacting and other artists would come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Tom focused on printmaking, sculpture and metal work. One of his favorite teachers was Jennifer Parker, the current Chair of the Art Department. &#8220;She was awesome and created a good space for us. We all hung out together&#8230;we were the &#8216;metal kids&#8217;.&#8221; Tom also created pieces in the foundry, studying under Doyle Foreman and Sean Monaghan. &#8220;We made a piece with Sean that&#8217;s at the Santa Cruz Veterans&#8217; Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was wonderful to work with,&#8221; observes Jennifer. &#8220;As an undergraduate Tom had an undeniable passion for creativity and a strong drive to acquire contemporary art ideologies and skills to make ideas come to life.&#160;He proved to be a very energetic, creative and intelligent student who displayed a vigorous and focused attitude towards the art making process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His work addressed some gigantic themes that centered on personal relationships and experiences,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;His ability to explore these themes without belittling them was a real tribute to his creative aptitude. Tom challenged his peers to&#160;<em>go beyond</em>&#160;the whimsical and playful aspects of his sculptures&#8230;to look at and investigate seriously what was beyond the very bright and colorful skins he applied to them.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s father had introduced him to meditation, so after graduation Tom decided to use that time to learn more about it. He travelled to upstate New York to a meditation center there and studied the practice for six months. &#8220;I wanted to see if I could spend my life doing that. And I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; laughs Tom. Instead, he used meditation to inform his work and still does that now. &#8220;That&#8217;s a big background to the process &#8211; meditation and visualization. Without that, it doesn&#8217;t go as deep. When students meditate, the creative process goes very deep and comes from a personal space that&#8217;s reflected in their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>While in New York, he also was hired at summer camps for kids and found that he loved teaching and working with them. He was a caregiver for a family, looking after their children, but when he tried to do his art as well, he found that he couldn&#8217;t do both and decided to return to California and focus on his primary passion.</p>
<p>Tom then took classes at California College of the Arts in San Francisco (CCA), studying metal and clay sculpture. &#8220;I realized that metal is the perfect medium because it&#8217;s solid liquid and is its own glue, as is clay,&#8221; he says. &#8220;With clay, I started doing the collaborations. A group of us got together to do projects and take them to the end.&#8221; Tom also met Berkeley sculptor John Toki at CCA who was one of his teachers and mentors. Toki has said of Tom: &#8220;Tom&#8217;s pretty unique in that he&#8217;s brought together a lot of young artists to make and show their artwork. No one knows how he does it. He&#8217;s like four men in one&#8230;.He&#8217;s like an art-development renaissance man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom started going from working in metal to working in clay and then discovered house paint. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as obvious, but it&#8217;s a perfect medium. You can dip things into it and it&#8217;s a wonderful glue because it also has color. I assemble found objects then dunk the piece in paint and people wonder if it was made from clay or ceramics. Doug [my father] was really pushing that on me. He looked at how the found objects could become one piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was further motivated to use found pieces to create his sculptures after reading a book by artist Nancy Graves. &#8220;I found her by chance in the library,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Her work is found objects and it can be plants and various materials, and she casts them all in bronze and then welds them together, which is a&#160;<em>lot</em>&#160;of work! There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to do that, but it has the same effect&#8230;objects transformed into one object so it works as one piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>His time at CCA also lead to his passion for collaborative art making. He and his fellow group of artists decided to get a space together and found an affordable fixer-upper in Berkeley that used to be a UC Berkeley dorm. They rented out part of it as studios and apartments to help pay for it. &#8220;I ended up driving the motivation to keep it going,&#8221; says Tom. &#8220;It was really fun but not a sustainable model because too much time had to be spent on running it.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this time, Tom, true to the Franco family nature of having multiple interests, was not only part of avant-garde dance troop and studying Tai Chi, but was also living at an ashram in Oakland where he met his wife and partner, Julia Lazar. Together they further developed Tom&#8217;s Firehouse Art Collective and expanded on Tom&#8217;s CoLab which gets artists together to create collaborative art projects. With Julia on board, Firehouse grew at a rapid pace and now consists of Firehouse Gilman Village Art Studios, Firehouse Gallery North, Firehouse Adeline Art Studios, Firehouse Harmon Street Studios, and Firehouse Live-Work Spaces at the Lottie Rose House, all in Berkeley. Julia, who died last year after a severe illness, was key in promoting Tom&#8217;s vision and making it all work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It started around food,&#8221; smiles Tom as he reminisces about meeting his wife. &#8220;I needed food and she was starved for art. We lived in the ashram together for about five years, then moved out and became a couple. We had five years as friends, five years as a couple, and one month as married.&#8221; Tom says that what they went through together was an incredible transition. &#8220;During those last five years we did a lot of positive things.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the future, Tom, at age 34, looks forward to going farther with his collaborative art process and, with inspiration from his brothers, is even thinking about making films. He wants to bring the CoLab program to more high schools and universities, or to anybody who would be interested in his innovative, collaborative approach to making art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I want to do more of my own art,&#8221; says Tom about what lies ahead. &#8220;The Firehouse is a lifelong project and I&#8217;m very proud of it. I&#8217;m excited about the vision of having things sustained and more collaborators joining. Most people agree that art is good!"</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d3ce605d8072701764c820a69111ead9"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2016/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/09/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1459547430964</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477419891975</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
