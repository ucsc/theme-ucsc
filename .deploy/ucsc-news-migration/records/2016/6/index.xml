Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).</p>
<p>More than $100,000 has been raised for the endowment to award an annual $2,500 scholarship to a social sciences student committed to social justice and public service. More than 520 alumni, community members, and friends of Zimmerman (Stevenson, sociology) have contributed since the fund was created soon after Zimmerman&#8217;s death. The fund has grown to a size where two annual scholarships may be awarded in the future.</p>
<p>At age 11, Sweeney lost her mother to cancer. Two years ago she received a $10,000 grant from the Livestrong Foundation to start a campus chapter of Camp Kesem, a summer program that supports children coping with a parent with cancer. She has since raised $180,000 to expand the camp. In addition, as a student, Sweeney volunteered at Barrios Unidos and was a resident advisor at Cowell College.</p>
<p>She also trained as a lead investigator at the Santa Cruz Public Defender&#8217;s Office to examine domestic violence, battery, petty theft, and alcohol cases, and is considering law school and the Peace Corps after graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe Katie Sweeney exemplifies the values and commitment to public service exemplified in the all-too-brief life and work of Gabriel Zimmerman,&#8221; faculty advisor Mary Beth Pudup wrote in her nomination letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katie stands for justice and social change,&#8221; said Andrea Steiner, a lecturer in Community Studies, speaking at the May 26 Social Sciences Student Awards Luncheon</p>
<p>Helping present the award was Ian Zimmerman, Gabe Zimmerman&#8217;s cousin. He thanked UC Santa Cruz and the fund&#8217;s many donors for helping keep his cousin&#8217;s memory fresh.</p>
<p>Also attending were the first Zimmerman scholarship winner, Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az (College Nine, &#8217;12, Latin American and Latino studies and sociology) and the 2014 winner Arash Mohajerinejad (Oakes, &#8217;14, sociology).</p>
<p>D&#237;az, who now works for Digital Nest, the Watsonville non-profit founded by alumnus Jacob Martinez (Oakes '04, ecology and evolutionary biology) to bridge the digital divide, reflected how she was deeply honored to be the inaugural recipient.</p>
<p>A job in public service means being a public servant, engaging day in and day out with lived experiences. It is a process that we celebrate today, she added.</p>
<p>Mohajerinejad, who fled his native Iran in 2003 after taking part in student protests, said he traveled to Tucson six months ago to pay his respects to Zimmerman. "I went to the place of tragedy to feel and connect him better and understand the tragedy with my soul," said Mohajerinejad who lives in the East Bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where you are there is always violence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel I have a duty to fight against the violence we are facing here and Gabriel is the light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki served as the master of ceremonies. &#8220;Throughout the luncheon we heard stories of students who have overcome great obstacles and engaged in amazing research and volunteer activities,&#8221; Kamieniecki said.</p>
<p>Also honored were 10 undergraduates who received a Dean&#8217;s Award for an outstanding undergraduate research project&#8211;including three who received a Chancellor&#8217;s Award. Also recognized were this year&#8217;s recipients of the Keeley Coastal Scholarship, Walsh Scholarship, Weiss Family Scholarship, and the Milam McGinty Kaun Award for Excellence in Teaching.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/2016-awards.html</url><title>View all 2015-2016 awards recipients in social sciences</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/camp-kesem-chapter.html</url><title>Senior leaves a legacy for families with cancer</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/12/zimmerman-scholars.html</url><title>How alumni carry on Gabriel Zimmermanâ€™s legacy of public service</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e458dc88072701713dacb134d55d39c"><name>farm-garden-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Farm &amp; Gardenâ€™s weekly CSA and market cart open for the season June 7</title><summary>The opportunity to obtain fresh, organic produce and flowers from the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden opens for the 2016 season beginning Tuesday, June 7.&#13;

<p>The Farm and Garden Market Cart at the base of the UCSC campus will be open from noon to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. Opening day, shoppers will find organically grown strawberries and blueberries, along with beets, spinach, lettuce, kale, and chard. Meyer lemons and flower bouquets will also be available.</p>
<p>June 7 is also the opening of the UCSC Farm&#8217;s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. Each week, members will receive a freshly picked box of organic produce from the UCSC Farm while supporting one of the nation&#8217;s longest-running organic farming and gardening training programs.</p>
<p>The full CSA 2016 season runs for 22 weeks through November 4. Full-season shares cost $560. A payment plan is available as are limited-income shares at $280. The program also accepts SNAP/EBT benefits.</p>
<p>A share of produce contains a diverse supply of freshly harvested organic fruits and vegetables throughout the season (roughly eight&#8211;13 items per week).</p>
<p>New this year will be an optional flower share for an additional $10 per week for 10 weeks (late June through late August). Flower share members will receive one large bouquet a week, featuring seasonal blooms from the farm fields. Additional flowers can be purchased at the market cart farm stand.</p>
<p>The market cart will be open through early November (weather permitting). As the season progresses, shoppers can look forward to heirloom and dry-farmed tomatoes, sweet corn, broccoli, potatoes, sweet and hot peppers, apples, pears, basil, winter squash, and more.</p>
<p>The Farm and Garden will again offer a "late-season share" for $280, with pickups beginning August 16 and extending through November 4.</p>
<p>Also new this year, CSA pickups will be scheduled on Tuesday and Fridays at the recently restored Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, with free parking in the hay barn lot.</p>
<p>The hay barn is the new &#8220;front door&#8221; to the 30-acre Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) farm and represents both the campus&#8217;s respect for its past and its commitment to a sustainable future.&#160; From the hay barn, members can take a path through the Hay Barn Field to pick flowers and herbs at the former CSA pickup site at the top of the Farm.</p>
<p>Pick-ups can also be arranged at the Westside Farm &amp; Feed store on Swift Street on Tuesday afternoons.</p>
<p>To sign up for the UCSC Farm&#8217;s 2016 CSA program, download and fill out the 2016 CSA Pledge Form (available at <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/community/produce-sales/csa-brochure-and-pledge-form.html">http://casfs.ucsc.edu/community/produce-sales/csa-brochure-and-pledge-form.html</a>). Printed copies are available by calling 831-459-3240, or by email at casfs@ucsc.edu.</p>

<p>The park will continue to be a housing option for undergraduate and graduate students for the foreseeable future, said Dave Keller, director of Housing Services.</p>
<p>"This plan will help ensure the Camper Park retains a sense of community, along with the affordability that so many students need," Keller said. "The changes will help more students afford the park by removing the burden to purchase and maintain a trailer for the duration of their residential tenure in the community."</p>
<p>The park has 42 spaces with four currently vacant, two of which are set aside for resident advisors (RAs). The campus will replace at least 12 units this summer and more in the coming years.</p>
<p>The RV replacements will occur as students graduate or otherwise move out, and prepare to sell their units, or when a trailer is so degraded that it is no longer safely habitable.</p>
<p>Continuing students will also have the opportunity to be in a university-owned vehicle if they wish to remove their RV from the park</p>
<p>Students who own a trailer in the park will be able to sell the RV on the open market and have it removed. Alternatively, the student can have the university remove the unit free of charge and receive $2,500.</p>
<p>Having the university own the trailers will remove the need for incoming students to purchase the trailers every summer from outgoing students-often at a significant cost. The monthly rental rate will continue to be low.</p>
<p>"Some students interested in living in the park can't afford to pay up front for a trailer," Keller said. "This change will help make the park affordable for many more students."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12577ce88072701713dacb1332ca59db"><name>zhang-tao</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>International economics graduate named deputy governor of Chinaâ€™s central bank</title><summary>An early graduate of the international economics Ph.D. program at UC Santa Cruz has been named to a top position at Chinaâ€™s central bank, a move seen as a step toward a future high-level appointment to the International Monetary Fund.</summary><start-date>1464891300000</start-date><display-name>Zhang Tao</display-name><path>/2016/06/zhang-tao</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/zhang-tao</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1464891569875</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464893435511</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/zhang-tao-275.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/zhang-tao-275.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zhang-tao-275.jpg</name><display-name>zhang-tao-275.jpg</display-name><file-size>61896</file-size><width>275</width><height>329</height></image><image-alt>zhang tao</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/zhang-tao-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/zhang-tao-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zhang-tao-80.jpg</name><display-name>zhang-tao-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>12302</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>zhang tao</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Zhang Tao received his Ph.D. in international economics from UC Santa Cruz in 1995.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An early graduate of the international economics Ph.D. program at UC Santa Cruz has been named to a top position at China&#8217;s central bank, a move seen as a step toward a future high-level appointment to the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Council appointed Zhang Tao, who received his masters and Ph.D. degrees from UCSC, as deputy governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China. If he replaces Zhu Min, a current IMF deputy managing director (and previous People's Bank deputy governor), in July, as is believed, Zhang will become the second Chinese national to hold a senior position at the Washington, D.C.-based international organization.</p>
<p>In the early &#8216;90s, Nirvikar Singh, UCSC professor of economics and current director of the Center for Analytical Finance, served as Zhang&#8217;s advisor. He remembers him as &#8220;smart, hardworking, and quite charming, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang received his Ph.D. degree from UCSC in December 1995. His research focused on federalism in China, Singh recalled. His dissertation was titled &#8220;Fiscal Decentralization, Public Spending and Economic Growth:&#160;&#160;the Experience in the Post-Reform China.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not surprised he has done well in his career, and I am delighted to hear the news about him,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>Before this most recent appointment, Zhang served as director general of the Legal Affairs Department at the People's Bank of China beginning in January 2015. He was an executive director at the IMF from September 2011 to 2014. Before joining the People&#8217;s Bank in 2004, he held positions at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as a senior economist.</p>
<p>Zhang graduated from Tsinghua University in Beijing before enrolling at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2016/05/20/china-names-new-central-bank-deputy-governor-to-replace-imfs-zhu-min</url><title>China names new central bank deputy governor to replace IMF's Zhu Min</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12d68a508072701713dacb135f9a04df"><name>humanities-awards-celebration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Linguistics professor Pranav Anand receives Dizikes Award for teaching in Humanities</title><summary>Associate professor of linguistics Pranav Anand was presented with the John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities at the Humanities Divisionâ€™s 2016 Spring Awards celebration held at the Cowell Provost House.&#13;

 <br/>
 Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the annual award is named in honor of emeritus professor John Dizikes, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It is designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its impact on undergraduate students.<br/>
 <br/>
 The award comes with an unusual provision. In addition to being honored with a check for $3,000, the faculty winner is also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. Anand chose Dhyana Buckley, a senior linguistics major with a passion for theater arts, who hopes to pursue a career of research in computational linguistics. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Annand noted that after years of teaching, he has learned to take students as they are, and to view them each as individuals. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;In teaching, I have had to reckon with the indirectness of my causal efficacy,&#8221; said Anand. &#8220;In the ideal case, when all things are humming and I have read minds aright, I afford learning by clearing the room of hazards. Indeed, perhaps my teaching philosophy is simply this: to work stridently to render myself invisible, to disappear in plain sight, leaving only blazes to mark the trail ahead.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Student scholarship recipient Buckley added that she appreciated how her linguistics classes promote individual critical thinking and problem solving without explicitly instructing students on how to complete the task at hand. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The sense of accomplishment that I have felt after solving a problem successfully is the highest return,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;This ability to think independently is one of the many skills I am grateful to have learned at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Chancellor George Blumenthal addressed</strong> the audience prior to the presentation of the awards. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I marvel that there still seems to be a question in the minds of some about the value today of a humanities education," said Blumenthal. "Let me be blunt: I think it is more valuable&#8212;and more needed&#8212;than ever.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I came across a quote from environmental attorney and author Gus Speth that sums up my feelings,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This guy has credentials--he is the founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, was an environmental adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton, and is a professor at Vermont Law School and the author of several books. And here is what he said:<br/>
 <br/>
 <em>"&#8216;I used to think the top environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, and climate change. I thought that with 30 years of good science we could address those problems. But I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed, and apathy. And to deal with those, we need a spiritual and cultural transformation&#8212;and we scientists don't know how to do that.&#8217;"</em><br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Truly, it's going to take all of us to get ourselves out of the pickle we've gotten into,&#8221; the chancellor concluded. &#8220;There's a major role for humanists. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you otherwise!&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="171da5a28072701713dacb138fb8c8ec"><name>ice-age-bison</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ice age bison fossils shed light on early human migrations in North America</title><summary>Scientists used bison fossils to date the opening of an ice-free corridor along the Rocky Mountains during the Pleistocene.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro, ancient DNA, steppe bison</keywords><start-date>1465239540000</start-date><display-name>Ice age bison fossils shed light on early human migrations in North America</display-name><path>/2016/06/ice-age-bison</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/ice-age-bison</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1464971665497</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465239498248</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/bison-bison-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/bison-bison-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bison-bison-400.jpg</name><display-name>bison-bison-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>69639</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>bison</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/bison-bison-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/bison-bison-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bison-bison-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bison-bison-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15512</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>bison</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The bison was recently declared the first national mammal of the United States.

The corridor has been considered a potential route for human and animal migrations between the far north (Alaska and Yukon) and the rest of North America, but when and how it was used has long been uncertain.</p>
<p>The researchers combined radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis to track the movements of bison into the corridor, showing that it was fully open by about 13,000 years ago. Their findings, published June 6 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, indicate that the corridor could not account for the initial dispersal of humans south of the ice sheets, but could have been used for later movements of people and animals, both northward and southward.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, geological studies suggested that the corridor might have been the pathway for the first movement of humans southward from Alaska to colonize the rest of the Americas. More recent evidence, however, indicated that the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets coalesced at the height of the last ice age, around 21,000 years ago, closing the corridor much earlier than any evidence of humans south of the ice sheets.</p>
<p>The initial southward movement of people into the Americas more than 15,000 years ago now seems likely to have been via a Pacific coastal route, but the Rocky Mountains corridor has remained of interest as a potential route for later migrations.</p>
<p>"The opening of the corridor provided new opportunities for migration and the exchange of ideas between people living north and south of the ice sheets," said first author Peter Heintzman, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz who led the DNA analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Distinct populations</strong></p>
<p>Previous work by coauthor Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, had shown that the bison populations north and south of the ice sheets were genetically distinct by the time the corridor opened. By analyzing bison fossils from within the corridor region, the researchers were able track the movement of northern bison southward into the corridor and southern bison northward.</p>
<p>"The radiocarbon dates told us how old the fossils were, but the key thing was the genetic analysis, because that told us when bison from the northern and southern populations were able to meet within the corridor," Heintzman said.</p>
<p>The results showed that the southern part of the corridor opened first, allowing southern bison to start moving northward as early as 13,400 years ago, before the corridor fully opened. Later, there was some movement of northern bison southward, with the two populations overlapping in the corridor by 13,000 years ago.</p>
<p>"Bison fossils are the most widespread Quaternary mammal in western North America and of interest because they survived the extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene, unlike most other North American large mammals," said coauthor Duane Froese of the University of Alberta. "We were able to sample bison fossils, largely from museum collections, including critical ones from central Alberta that dated to the initial opening of the corridor."</p>
<p><strong>Human migration</strong></p>
<p>According to Shapiro, archeological evidence suggests that human migration within the corridor was mostly from south to north. Sites associated with the Clovis hunting culture and its distinctive fluted point technology were widespread south of the corridor around 13,000 years ago and decline in abundance from south to north within the corridor region. A Clovis site in Alaska has been dated to no earlier than 12,400 years ago.</p>
<p>"When the corridor opened, people were already living south of there. And because those people were bison hunters, we can assume they would have followed the bison as they moved north into the corridor," Shapiro said.</p>
<p>The steppe bison of the Pleistocene <em>(Bison priscus)</em> were much bigger than modern bison <em>(Bison bison)</em>, she said. Before the corridor closed, prior to the last glacial maximum, they moved freely up and down between the ice-free regions in the north and grasslands south of the ice sheets. After the ice sheets coalesced, the population that was cut off to the south contracted, leaving one genetically distinct southern lineage.</p>
<p>The DNA analysis used in this study focused on mitochondrial DNA, which is easier to recover from fossils than the DNA in chromosomes, because each cell has thousands of copies of the relatively short mitochondrial DNA sequence. While Shapiro's lab led the DNA analyses, Froese's lab led the radiocarbon dating work.</p>
<p>Many of the fossils they analyzed came from collections at the Royal Alberta Museum in Edmonton and other institutions. "Thousands of steppe bison fossils are recovered in northern Canada every year," said coauthor Grant Zazula of the Government of Yukon Palaeontology Program in Whitehorse. "Most of these fossils are uncovered by mining or gravel pit operators and later made available to scientists for study. These results speak to the importance of collecting and preserving fossils in order to better understand our history."</p>
<p>The research team included coauthors from UC Santa Cruz, the Government of Yukon paleontology and archaeology programs, Pennsylvania State University, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Center, Simon Fraser University, Royal Alberta Museum, UC Irvine, and UCLA. This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Canada Research Chairs program, and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="177b64b58072701713dacb132bf8f1e7"><name>griggs-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gary Griggs honored by Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</title><summary>Geologist Gary Griggs received the Laura Hecox Naturalist Award from the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History.</summary><keywords>Gary Griggs, Laura Hecox</keywords><start-date>1464937200000</start-date><display-name>Gary Griggs honored by Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</display-name><path>/2016/06/griggs-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/griggs-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1464977809246</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464978288101</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/gary-griggs-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/gary-griggs-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gary-griggs-350.jpg</name><display-name>gary-griggs-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>77686</file-size><width>350</width><height>444</height></image><image-alt>Gary Griggs</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19178</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Gary Griggs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Gary Griggs&#160;received the Laura Hecox Naturalist Award last month at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History.

<p>Griggs is the first recipient of the Laura Hecox Naturalist Award, which honors Santa Cruz community members who exemplify the museum&#8217;s mission to connect people with nature in ways that help others to appreciate, understand, and protect the wonders of the natural world.</p>
<p>Laura Hecox, in addition to being Santa Cruz&#8217;s lighthouse keeper in the late 1800s, was a naturalist who deeded her collection of shells and fossils to the community for the establishment of the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History. The museum established the award in her honor to recognize those who generously and enthusiastically share their knowledge and love of natural history and inspire others to do the same.</p>
<p>Heather Moffat, executive director of the museum, said Griggs was a natural choice to be the first recipient of this award. "A world-renowned scientist, Dr. Griggs is equally respected for his passion and talent for educating and inspiring generations of students, as well as the public, about the fascinating world around us and our role within it," she said.</p>
<p>Griggs will give a public presentation this fall on behalf of the museum about his research on the impact of sea level change on California&#8217;s coastline. In his research and teaching, Griggs has focused on the coast of California, including coastal processes, hazards, coastal engineering, and sea level rise. He is the author of several books, including <em>Living with the Changing California Coast; The Santa Cruz Coast: Then and Now;</em> <em>California&#8217;s Coast and Beaches</em>; and, most recently, <em>Our Ocean Backyard: Collected Essays</em>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="183549ff8072701713dacb13d55bce0d"><name>ucla-incident</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Incident at UCLA and UC Santa Cruz resources</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz community remains saddened today about the apparent murder-suicide incident at UCLA.

<p>Tragic news can be difficult to process. I encourage students who wish to speak with someone to contact Counseling and Psychological Services at 831-459-2628. Faculty and staff may call the Employee Assistance Program at <a href="tel:866-808-6205" target="_blank" value="+18668086205">866-808-6205</a></p>
<p>The news from UCLA comes at a time when students may be feeling pressure or anxiety as they work on important assignments and take final exams. "Healthy" stress associated with the end of the quarter can provide that extra little push that can help students complete assignments. However, stress that feels punishing or inescapable to the point that it interferes with the achievement of goals raises concerns; there are campus resources that can help all members of the UC Santa Cruz community through such difficult times.</p>
<p>f you find yourself struggling, please seek support. You may contact the Dean of Students Office or the Slug Support Program at <a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a> or 831-459-4446.

<br/>
The training is designed to prepare our police department, local allied law enforcement agencies, and local fire agencies on how to respond to an active shooter incident using the latest tactics and equipment available. <br/>
<br/>
As such, some areas around Kresge College and adjacent parking lots will be cordoned off by yellow tape and signs, and will be off-limits to anyone not participating in the training exercises. In addition, those near the area may hear sounds of screaming, simulated gun fire, and other noises as part of the training.<br/>
<br/>
This annual training is a continuation of ongoing efforts to prepare the campus for workplace violence and active shooter incidents. <br/>
<br/>
These training sessions are not open to the public. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause, but it is imperative that these activities take place.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as with every year, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department will be preparing a series of three-hour training sessions on community response to active shooter incidents for the UC Santa Cruz community. If you are interested in receiving this training, please email <a href="#">police@ucsc.edu.</a> <br/>
<br/>
If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext 1.<br/>

On Friday alone, there are 16 departmental or organizational celebrations scheduled throughout the day, resulting in hundreds of visitors needing on-campus parking. Parking in the East Remote lot will be free on Friday to accommodate many of them. However, traffic on campus will be much heavier than usual, and parking for some celebrations will be in centrally-located parking lots. Please consider coordinating with your supervisor to work off-site or from home on Friday, or consider using alternative transportation to get to campus. Metro buses serving the UCSC campus will be fare-free on Saturday and Sunday. Campus shuttles will be operating on the summer intersession Loop bus schedule (starting at 7:30 a.m.) on Friday, with added evening Loop buses operating until 10 p.m. During the weekend campus Loop shuttle service will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
If you routinely park on campus with a valid UCSC parking permit, you should be able to park in the lot you normally use on Friday. Display your permit as usual, and please don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs, "Special Pass" holders, or disabled visitors.<br/>
<br/>
If you will be on campus during the weekend, please be aware that traffic restrictions will be in place on Hagar Drive, which will be closed in the downhill direction from Steinhart Drive to the East Remote parking lot. If you will be leaving campus from the west side or campus core, please use Coolidge Drive, as Heller Drive may be heavily impacted with commencement ceremony traffic.<br/>

<p>The authors, including David Haussler, scientific director of the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> at UC Santa Cruz, as well as a diverse team of international leaders in academia, research, medicine, and industry, argue that a common framework of principles, protocols, and interoperable technical systems are necessary to enable responsible and effective data sharing.</p>
<p>GA4GH was established in 2013 to bring the community together to build the tools and establish the standards necessary to achieve that goal. Today, it counts more than 400 organizations and more than 700 individuals in its membership, which spans more than 70 countries. &#8220;These stakeholders are working together across traditional boundaries to create the common framework that will allow us to make best use of the millions of genome sequences that currently sit in siloed databases around the globe,&#8221; said Peter Goodhand, GA4GH executive director and a member of the author group.</p>
<p><strong>Data sharing projects</strong></p>
<p>To date, GA4GH has created a toolkit of diverse products, including the Genomics API, which allows disparate technology services to exchange genotypic and phenotypic data, as well as the Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health Related Data, which outlines the basic principles and core elements for responsible data sharing. GA4GH has also catalyzed the development of three data sharing projects which aim to illustrate the value of sharing data in real world contexts. These consist of (i) an open-ended approach to sharing data across the internet (the <a href="https://beacon-network.org/#/">Beacon Network</a>), (ii) an international collaboration among breast cancer genetics experts (the <a href="http://brcaexchange.org/">BRCA Challenge</a>), and (iii) a peer-to-peer network of clinicians (<a href="http://www.matchmakerexchange.org/">Matchmaker Exchange</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;While still nascent, these projects are already having a positive impact; their true value will come when the tools are applied at scale," said Haussler, who also serves as co-chair of the GA4GH Steering Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining challenges</strong></p>
<p>In addition to outlining successes, the paper notes a variety of remaining challenges to sharing data across national and institutional boundaries. For example, the membership is currently working on solutions to secure data access while maximizing the scope of information that can be shared, to create tools that are flexible enough to be readily implemented in different knowledge domains, and to establish sustainable funding models that support data curation, hosting, and computation.</p>
<p>"Millions of genome sequences are being generated around the globe, but to gain the full benefits from these data &#8212; to advance human health and to prevent and treat disease &#8212; laboratory and clinical investigators will need more effective means of access to data, regardless of where the data are stored,&#8221; said Professor Harold Varmus of Weill Cornell Medical College, former director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and chair of the GA4GH Scientific Advisory Board. &#8220;The only way to do that is for the global community to come together across traditional boundaries &#8212; be they national, institutional, or technical &#8212; to create a federated ecosystem that works for everyone. The GA4GH has begun to do that in the projects described in this new report.&#8221;</p>

The awards honor instructors who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.</p>
<p>Students make the nominations and more than 620 were received this year. Nine faculty members from engineering, humanities, sciences, and social sciences were selected for their inspirational teaching.</p>
<p>The awards include a cash prize. Nominees are also asked to submit a personal statement on their teaching philosophies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bring caring, passion, talent and commitment to teaching,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said at the June 2 luncheon when the awards were presented. &#8220;I&#8217;m delghted to present these awards to you today."</p>
<p>Blumenthal noted that excellent teaching is a core value at UC Santa Cruz and central to the student experience.</p>
<p>The winners of the Excellence in Teaching Award for 2016 are:</p>
<p><strong>Caitlin Binder</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in chemistry</em><br/>
 Caitlin Binder is the recipient of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>Binder wrote in her statement that she thinks of her classes as being a performance, catching the attention of her students and giving them something memorable to take home. In <em>Organic Chemistry</em>, she brings students to the front of the class and connects them with bungee cords to demonstrate resonance and molecular geometry. She also uses &#8220;acro-chemistry&#8221; in the classroom, integrating movement and acrobatics into her lessons.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students get to see my active and goofy side that I rarely get to express as a lecturer,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;I close with the message that they can achieve anything if they practice enough.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Bonett</strong><br/>
 <em>Professor of psychology</em><br/>
 Douglas Bonett teaches upper-division statistics, a required course for psychology majors, who bring a wide range of comfort levels to the subject. Students praised him for a clear, calm teaching style and for making the material interesting and relevant in the real world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I encourage students to ask questions at any time during the lecture. In large lecture sections, I will stop lecturing about every 10 minutes and ask a few questions about material just covered,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Student responses and questions also provides valuable feedback about their level of understanding and if I need to explain some concepts again with different examples or from a different angle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonett also emphasizes the need to be ethical and conservative with statistics. As the director of the Center for Statistical Analysis in the Social Sciences, he developed two popular concentration programs for graduate students.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Crosby</strong><br/>
 <em>Professor of psychology</em><br/>
 Faye Crosby teaches research methods. She wrote that there are three components that make up good teaching: instruction, engagement, and inspiration. Instruction involves the transfer of knowledge. It&#8217;s useful and necessary&#8212;but not nearly as exciting or enriching as inspiration, which touches students&#8217; emotions and motivates them to take action. The job of the professor, she noted, is to arrange material in such a way that students become engaged in the subject matter. Because ultimately, it is students who teach themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must adapt our techniques to the situation,&#8221; Crosby wrote. &#8220;In a large lecture class, I structure every minute and throw oranges to the students to keep them alert. In an advanced seminar, I try to speak less than the students and throw no oranges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crosby&#8217;s students describe her as the most caring, enthusiastic, and loving professor they&#8217;ve ever had. One wrote, Faye&#8217;s personality &#8220;radiates throughout every lecture.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Larrabee</strong><br/>
 <em>Professor of computer engineering</em><br/>
 Tracy Larrabee teaches Computer Systems and Assembly Language, the first course in hardware design that&#8217;s required for all engineering majors. For many students, it&#8217;s a new and intimidating experience. Students said Larrabee works hard to make her teaching personal, motivational, and participatory.</p>
<p>She emphasizes that computer engineering is inherently challenging and reassures students that failure is part of the learning process&#8212;and she celebrates their success when they triumph over perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell (students) that the best sign of a good study session is waste basket filled with discarded calculations (even if these days that waste basket might be an electronic one),&#8221; Larrabee wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Lasar</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in history</em><br/>
 Matthew Lasar wrote that the central message of history is choice. No chapter of human history was inevitable. No chapter was devoid of choice&#8212;nationalism, slavery, romantic love, free labor. Past generations have always made choices, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These discoveries free us, I think. They empower us to make decisions in our time; to act conservatively in some instances, or radically in others. Our ancestors chose then. We can and must choose now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lasar makes himself available to students for an extraordinary level of counsel and support. Even in a class of 40 students&#8212;with no TA support&#8212;he meets individually with each student. One student wrote that Lasar brings wit and humor to his lectures, during which he reads speeches, sings songs, and even danced to the Bee Gees.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Mathiowetz</strong><br/>
 <em>Associate professor of politics</em><br/>
 Dean Mathiowetz wrote that he considers kindness the most important aspect of his approach to teaching. He has high standards and provides generous feedback on student work&#8212;but kindness is what allows students to take risks, to ask difficult&#8212;or sometimes very basic&#8212;questions, and to be comfortable with the important role that not knowing plays in learning.</p>
<p>His students admire and appreciate him, writing that he is &#8220;the most intelligent and remarkably engaging individual I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to learn from here at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221; One student marveled at coming to love reading Aristotle, Augustine, and Plato, while another wrote, &#8220;I left his classroom every day with a renewed sense of purpose and ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>To model the contribution of &#8220;not knowing,&#8221; Mathiowetz shows up to class prepared with an outline and clear sense of the end point, but the path isn&#8217;t set in stone. Students&#8217; contributions can always shift the route.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn Millhauser</strong><br/>
 <em>Distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry</em><br/>
 Glenn Millhauser wrote that he feels fortunate to teach chemistry, a subject that is connected to so many critical issues today, from climate change to genetic disorders. He uses pressing topical issues to engage students in the classroom.</p>
<p>The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, became a galvanizing &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; in Millhauser's Chemistry 1 class this year. Early in the quarter, he gave a mini-lecture on the chemistry of water passing through lead pipes&#8212;noting that pipes in Santa Cruz also leach lead into drinking water&#8212;and watched students sit up and take notice, empowered by their understanding of basic chemistry and what it means in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Students describe him as devoted, passionate, and approachable, and say his teaching is outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Mitchell</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in mathematics</em><br/>
 For 32 years, Richard Mitchell has taught a range of mathematics courses at UC Santa Cruz. His courses have ranged from math for nonmath majors to honors-level calculus for math and physics majors.</p>
<p>Mitchell wrote that it has been his mission to invite students to look deeply into what he calls &#8220;this strangely beautiful realm of thought.&#8221; Many students come in having had bad experiences with math, and Mitchell tackles the challenge head on.</p>
<p>He tries to break down stereotypes associated with mathematics and mathematicians&#8212;and to overcome students&#8217; expectations that they will never understand math. He relies on a process he calls demystification, which begins with helping students master the language of mathematics. Demystification ends when students gain a deep conceptual understanding of&#8212;and appreciation for&#8212;mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Sanders-Self</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in literature</em><br/>
 Melissa Sanders-Self is a lecturer in literature who wrote that she feels privileged to teach creative writing. For undergraduates who are just starting out, she considers her most important job to be helping them discover a love and passion for reading and writing that will endure throughout their lives.</p>
<p>For upper-division students who want to be writers, she said her job is to guide them&#8212;which often involves instilling an appreciation for rewriting, editing, and polishing their work.</p>
<p>Sanders-Self helps students find their voice as writers, and she works hard to create a safe environment emotionally for students to express themselves on the page and in the classroom. Her feedback is legendary: she often writes one- to three-page responses, covering line edits as well as big-picture thoughts.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b8c24378072701713dacb13e4851d53"><name>women-in-engineering</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Baskin School recognizes women graduating with engineering degrees</title><summary>Women make up 19 percent of engineering undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz this year, up from 12 percent in 2005.

<p>The event, at College 9/10&#8217;s Bhojwani Dining Room, was the first of its kind on campus, attracting about 150 attendees, mostly undergraduate women, professors and engineering alumni. It was inspired by a similar event at Indiana University, which like UC Santa Cruz, is a member of the National Center for Women and Information Technology, a nonprofit working to close the gender gap in computing.</p>
<p>Women make up 19 percent of engineering undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz this year, up from 12 percent in 2005, according to Charlie McDowell, computer science professor and one of the event&#8217;s organizers.</p>
<p>One of the reasons he wanted to hold the event is to help retain women in the engineering school, he said. Most of the students in attendance were in their first or second year. When he asked the audience how many were surprised to see so many other female computing majors in the room, most raised their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to help them build more community and not feel like they&#8217;re one of a few in a male-dominated major,&#8221; McDowell said.</p>
<p>Remington Maxwell, a computer science major and computer engineering minor, is graduating magna cum laude this spring and has taken an engineering job at Grass Valley, a software company. For the past three years, Maxwell has advised her peers as a leader at <a href="https://awesome.soe.ucsc.edu/">Project AWESOmE</a>, a Baskin School of Engineering group dedicated to advancing women in engineering, and one of the banquet&#8217;s sponsors.</p>
<p>Common themes Maxwell heard from other women was that they felt isolated in their major, and also felt pressure to hide any struggles they had with the work because they didn&#8217;t want to seem weak.</p>
<p>Maxwell said she felt the same pressures, and advised other students to network with professors in the department, and attend office hours even if they didn&#8217;t have specific questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It created a support network, so if I had any issues I knew where to go and I had people who could advocate for me,&#8221; Maxwell said.</p>
<p>Project AWESOmE hosts speakers, workshops, mentoring and social events to help women engineering students network. It was co-founded in 2011 by McDowell and Adrienne Harrell, while she was serving as the Baskin School&#8217;s director of undergraduate student affairs. Project AWESOmE is one of a number of Baskin School of Engineering programs designed to support women in engineering.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s message, Harrell said, is that &#8220;just because it&#8217;s hard doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not good at it. And I think that&#8217;s something that does impact women&#8217;s confidence, so that&#8217;s a message that we&#8217;re constantly trying to fight against, that failure and things being difficult is part of the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Friday&#8217;s event, 18 faculty and staff, nominated by students, were recognized for their role in mentoring and motivating female engineering students.</p>
<p>Suzanne da Camara, a graduate student instructor for an introductory computer programming course, was one of those nominated. After the dinner, former students approached her to say hello and ask advice about graduate school.</p>
<p>At the beginning of her course, da Camara asks students to write their biggest fears about the introductory course, and she said she&#8217;s shocked how many are terrified of computer programming.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my job,&#8221; da Camara said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to show them that when you think you can&#8217;t&#8212;you can.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2bb1867c8072701713dacb13c953c491"><name>lee-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring 2016 academic curriculum updates</title><summary>By Herbie Lee, Vice Provost Academic Affairs â€” Every year, faculty add, update, and occasionally discontinue academic programs to ensure our students get the best possible education.

This year, we are making changes to the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, as well as to our online offerings.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce these enhancements to the UC Santa Cruz curriculum:</p>
<p>Following the department establishment in 2014, a proposal for a Ph.D. and an M.S. in Computational Media is awaiting UC systemwide approval. These degree programs will provide students with an interdisciplinary education in a computing field that integrates arts and humanities research and practice. Both degrees aim to prepare students to be leaders in computational media, with master&#8217;s students performing innovative media creation and doctoral students researching at the forefront of computational media and contributing to the development of the field.</p>
<p>Two designated emphases have been established for graduate students to broaden their training in a related or different field from their declared degree program. The Designated Emphasis in Human Language Media and Modeling enhances the training in conducting research around issues related to theories and computational models of human language data in a range of media. The Designated Emphasis in Scientific Computing provides a formal opportunity to demonstrate mastery in scientific computing through coursework and research in computer simulations, numerical algorithms, and techniques for data analysis, visualization, and storage. Both of these programs are available to either master&#8217;s or doctoral students.</p>
<p class="DefaultCxSpLast">The Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) Teaching Certificate available to graduate students is offered by the Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators (ISEE). The certificate recognizes graduate students who have completed the requirements of the ISEE Professional Development Program, including lesson plan development, practical teaching experience, and post-teaching reflection.</p>
<p>The Collaborative Leadership Ed.D. program has been discontinued.</p>
<p>The Department of Economics has established a partnership with Hastings College of Law, allowing Hastings law students to pursue the M.S. in Applied Finance and Economics while completing their Juris Doctor degree from UC Hastings.</p>
<p class="DefaultCxSpFirst">Adding to the existing five-year contiguous bachelor&#8217;s/master&#8217;s paths in Computer Engineering, Linguistics, and Physics, new programs have been established in Computer Science, Philosophy and Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology. Five-year contiguous bachelor&#8217;s/master&#8217;s programs (previously called 4+1 programs) benefit students by providing qualified undergraduates increased opportunities for career and/or future academic success. Students are be able to deepen their knowledge and experience in an academic field, complete both degree programs efficiently and often in a shorter time, obtain additional employment credentials, and improve their competitiveness for pursuing doctoral studies in top programs.</p>
<p class="DefaultCxSpMiddle">Two new minors have been established. The minor in History of Consciousness provides undergraduate students engagement with the knowledge and critical approaches distinctively associated with the department&#8217;s graduate program. The minor in Music will provide undergraduate students a focus for music activities as well as a background in music theory, history, and performance.</p>
<p>The minor in Sociology has been suspended. The courses covering requirements of the minor will be continued, allowing currently declared minors to complete the program with respect to catalog rights.</p>
<p>The Literature Department has discontinued the concentrations in English Language Literatures, Modern Literary Studies, Pre- and Early Modern Studies, and World Literature and Cultural Studies. This change is a result of faculty realigning the bachelor&#8217;s program from a focus on national literary canons to a focus on critical approaches.</p>
<p>Faculty have also been active in developing and offering fully online courses on several interesting topics. This summer, faculty will offer 13 different online courses, making it a great time to continue learning. These courses are fully online, allowing you to take them from anywhere in the world where there is Internet access. Here&#8217;s a link to online summer courses: <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/courses/online-courses.html">http://summer.ucsc.edu/courses/online-courses.html</a></p>
<p>The campus is currently offing two free online courses on Coursera: <em>C++ for C Programmers (Part A)</em>, and <em>The Holocaust</em> (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/ucsc">https://www.coursera.org/ucsc</a>). If these courses don&#8217;t pique your interest, this summer the campus will release three more free courses: <em>C++ for C Programmers (Part B)</em>, <em>Bayesian Statistics</em>, and <em>Children Acquiring Literacy Naturally</em>. I hope you&#8217;ll take advantage of these opportunities to continue learning.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2c474d2c8072701713dacb135139bdd3"><name>planet-hunting-grad-student</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The sky is no limit for planet-hunting grad student</title><summary>Astronomy grad student Jennifer Burt helped write software that turned a powerful telescope at Lick Observatory into the first automated planet finder in the world.</summary><keywords>Astronomy, Jennifer Burt, Lick Observatory, Automated Planet Finder</keywords><start-date>1465282800000</start-date><display-name>The sky is no limit for planet-hunting grad student</display-name><path>/2016/06/planet-hunting-grad-student</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/planet-hunting-grad-student</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1465326716894</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465600305193</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/burt-jennifer.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/burt-jennifer.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>burt-jennifer.jpg</name><display-name>burt-jennifer.jpg</display-name><file-size>36043</file-size><width>404</width><height>604</height></image><image-alt>Grad student Jennifer Burt, above, "played the linchpin role in writing the software that </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/burt-jennifer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/burt-jennifer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>burt-jennifer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>burt-jennifer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3127</file-size><width>84</width><height>84</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Grad student Jennifer Burt, above, "played the linchpin role in writing the software that </image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Grad student Jennifer Burt, above, "played the linchpin role in writing the software that puts the &#8216;A&#8217; in the APF (Automated Planet Finder) Telescope,&#8221; said Greg Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics.

<p>While most people slept, Burt would examine weather, atmospheric conditions, and time of year before deciding which stars on a long list of possibilities would be the best targets for a powerful telescope located at Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton. A run of fingers over computer keys would then start the telescope searching portions of the night sky for its prey: planets that orbited stars beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a year,&#8221; said the 28-year-old with a laugh, &#8220;I thought maybe we should automate this thing because I would like to sleep at night."</p>
<p>Which is exactly what the competitive ballroom dancer and former Cornell University grad did. She went to work helping write software that turned the $12 million telescope into a robotic version of herself. It became the first automated planet finder in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenn played the linchpin role in writing the software that puts the &#8216;A&#8217; in the APF (Automated Planet Finder) Telescope,&#8221; says Greg Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;With hard-won night after night of on-sky experience, she was able to gain a full understanding of all the nuances, subtleties, and contingencies that occur in the course of operations. She was then able to fully translate this intuitive understanding into the stark, fully defined logical structure that permits a computer to take over the night-to-night role of a human observer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon, however, Burt will give up the redwoods of Santa Cruz for the historic streets of Cambridge, Mass., where she won a post-doc fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and hopes to work on a NASA project aimed at discovering more about these so-called extrasolar planets or exoplanets. The project, dubbed TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), is designed to determine the radii and orbits of the planets it detects. More than 3,000 have already been discovered.</p>
<p>With nearby Harvard also taking part in the project, &#8220;it&#8217;s a cool place to be for someone like me,&#8221; Burt says. She notes however, the opportunity might not have happened without the guidance of her UC Santa Cruz mentors and a $10,000 scholarship from the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation.</p>
<p>Tall, with long, dark hair and a way of explaining astronomy that can make even a science-phobe get excited about stargazing, Burt came to her career thanks to an old telescope set up at a family cabin in the Adirondacks and an energetic teacher who ran a NASA club at her high school in upstate New York. A club visit to Arizona State University, where NASA projects were being undertaken, sealed her fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That trip made it clear early on for me that astronomy was a viable career path,&#8221; Burt says.</p>
<p>At Cornell, Burt&#8217;s attention was grabbed by the emerging field of exoplanet research, which led her to UC Santa Cruz and two professors of astronomy and astrophysics, Laughlin and Steve Vogt. Here, she began her nocturnal planet detecting with the result that her team was able to discover three different planetary systems using the APF telescope&#160;and its high-precision instrument, the Ken and Gloria Levy Spectrometer.</p>
<p>The finding that most electrifies her was the detection of six planets orbiting a nearby star with the decidedly un-electrifying name of HD219134.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s especially exciting because the star is very bright so we can do a lot of follow-up studies,&#8221; Burt says. &#8220;The second thing that makes it cool is that at the same time we found six planets, another team in Switzerland found the same system but it had only seen the inner four planets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burt also is credited with locating a Neptune-sized planet orbiting a red dwarf star, and, while she admits there was nothing exceptional about this particular planet, the discovery showed the APF telescope and Levy Spectrometer are designed perfectly for their job, which is to find even the most common planets.</p>
<p>For Burt, who sports a star-shaped ring and a galactic-themed cell phone cover, the future holds the promise of discovering more about these exoplanets: their properties, their origin and, as always, whether there are other habitable Earth-sized planets out there.</p>
<p>Delving into far-flung mysteries is exactly the place a sci-fi-loving scientist like Burt wants to find herself. But she wouldn&#8217;t have arrived, she says, without the ARCS scholarship&#8212;which allowed her to travel to meet prominent people in the field, resulting in a post-doctoral position&#8212;and also without the help of Laughlin and Vogt.</p>
<p>Burt, who also coached the UC Santa Cruz ballroom dance team and designed a training program for teaching assistants on campus, says Vogt &#8220;taught me everything I know about finding planets&#8221; while Laughlin, a theorist, &#8220;taught me to look for the big science questions that were interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any scientist&#8217;s eventual success is based, in part, on the people who supported them along the way,&#8221; Burt says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been extremely fortunate to work with advisors who were always willing to share their knowledge, while also continually pushing me to become a better researcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge advantage when you&#8217;re starting out.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/Jennifer-Bert-295-128.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/Jennifer-Bert-295-128.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Jennifer-Bert-295-128.jpg</name><display-name>Jennifer-Bert-295-128.jpg</display-name><file-size>10088</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>JENNIFER BURT</title><description>The astronomy Ph.D. candidate helped write software that turned a powerful telescope at Lick Observatory into the first automated planet finder in the world.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cbd30c98072701713dacb1303cb71fb"><name>antonio-lamb</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biology grad wins seed funding for biotech startup company</title><summary>Antonio Lamb followed his passion for molecular biology, and his biotech startup now has $100,000 in seed funding.</summary><keywords>Antonio Lamb, Microsynbiotix, IndieBio EU</keywords><start-date>1465398000000</start-date><display-name>Biology grad wins seed funding for biotech startup company</display-name><path>/2016/06/antonio-lamb</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/antonio-lamb</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1465334442762</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465398075864</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/antonio-lamb1-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/antonio-lamb1-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>antonio-lamb1-350.jpg</name><display-name>antonio-lamb1-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>73627</file-size><width>350</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Antonio Lamb</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24226</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Microsynbiotix logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Antonio Lamb graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2015 and cofounded Microsynbiotix, a biotech startup working to produce oral vaccines for farmed fish.

<p>Inspired by professors such as Jeremy Lee and Michael Rexach in the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental (MCD) Biology, Lamb grew increasingly interested in both the concepts of genetics and molecular biology and their practical applications in biomedicine and other areas. He became a regular at <a href="http://biocurious.org/">BioCurious</a>, a community "biohacker" space in Sunnyvale, where he experimented with plant tissue culture and other techniques. He even bought some used equipment on eBay and set up a laboratory in his garage so he could practice the concepts he was learning in his classes.</p>
<p>Lamb's DIY approach to molecular biology seems to be paying off. After graduating in June 2015 with a B.S. in MCD biology, he cofounded a biotechnology startup company, <a href="https://www.microsynbiotix.com/">Microsynbiotix</a>, which recently won $100,000 in seed funding from <a href="https://eu.indiebio.co/">IndieBio EU</a>, a synthetic biology accelerator program.</p>
<p><strong>Oral vaccines</strong></p>
<p>In addition to a $50,000 cash investment, IndieBio is providing the company with laboratory space and equipment in a biotech incubator at University College Cork, Ireland, as well as mentorship and other services. Lamb is now in Ireland working on a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate the feasibility of the company's plan to produce oral vaccines for farmed fish using genetically modified microalgae.</p>
<p>"It doesn't surprise me that he's doing this," said Jarmila Pittermann, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who had Lamb as a student in her plant physiology class and was struck by his curiosity and sincere interest in the material. "He would regularly ask questions after class, and he was especially interested in the molecular aspects of plant physiology. He impressed me as someone who is very creative, and looking for novel ways to solve problems."</p>
<p>"He's totally unconventional," said Rexach, who had Lamb in his advanced cell biology class. "He was very inquisitive and seemed especially interested in learning how to do things. I never got the impression he wanted to get an A. He just wanted to learn how to manipulate the biochemistry of organisms."</p>
<p>Through connections he made in the biohacker community, Lamb met scientists interested in microalgae as a biotechnology platform for producing oral vaccines, including Simon Porphy, a biochemical engineer with expertise in algal fermentation, and Jeffrey Boore, an adjunct professor at UC Berkeley and CEO of Genome Project Solutions. They launched a <a href="https://experiment.com/projects/support-our-efforts-to-demonstrate-that-insulin-and-oral-vaccines-can-be-cheaply-made-in-microalgae">project</a> on the crowdfunding platform <a href="https://experiment.com/">Experiment</a> that eventually led to the founding of Microsynbiotix.</p>
<p><strong>Aquaculture</strong></p>
<p>Their focus now is to develop a working prototype to demonstrate that protein production in algae is a viable approach for making oral vaccines for aquaculture. Bacterial and viral diseases are a serious problem in aquaculture operations, requiring the use of antibiotics to control disease or costly vaccination procedures that involve injecting each fish individually.</p>
<p>"Effective and affordable oral vaccines could reduce the risk of devastating diseases that can destroy entire stocks of farmed fish," Lamb said. "With microalgae genetically modified to express oral vaccine proteins, the algal cells serve as the delivery vehicle, because algae are a natural part of the diet for the fish."</p>
<p>Genetically engineered microorganisms have been used since the 1980s to produce proteins such as insulin for medical use. Using algal cells as the protein factories, rather than bacteria or yeast, is relatively new, but Lamb says it is now feasible and economically viable. For the proof-of-concept project, he said, the company is inserting a gene for synthetic insulin into the chloroplasts of microalgae, where the protein can accumulate to high concentrations without disrupting cellular functions.</p>
<p><strong>Industry investors</strong></p>
<p>Through the IndieBio EU accelerator program, the company hopes to attract the interest of investors in the aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries, Lamb said.</p>
<p>His pathway into the biotechnology industry has not followed the usual route. The traditional path for a student interested in a field like molecular biology would be to earn a Ph.D., followed by a postdoctoral fellowship, and then they might land a faculty position or a job in industry. Lamb's approach has more in common with the Silicon Valley startup culture, Rexach said. "I think what he's doing is good," he said. "I'm impressed."</p>
<p>Lamb calls his nontraditional path a new model for funding scientific research. "Crowdfunding is now a viable system for funding research projects," he said. "And organizations like IndieBio and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> offer opportunities for funding that students and entrepreneurs can take advantage of."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ce887b38072701713dacb13063537ad"><name>diversity-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellorâ€™s Achievement Awards for Diversity honor work, commitment</title><summary>The campus recognized work done by students, faculty, staff, and programs to promote diversity and inclusion on campus through the 2016 Chancellorâ€™s Achievement Awards for Diversity.&#13;

<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal noted the award ceremony is one of his year's highlights and praised the work of Campus Diversity Officer for Staff and Students Sheree Marlowe, who accepted a job to become chief officer of diversity and inclusion at Clark University in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheree joined us in 2013 and has expanded our diversity initiatives and programming in bold and lasting ways,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;She has been a great bridge-builder: working with students, staff, academic departments and divisions, and other campus units, including the Academic Senate and my Diversity Advisory Council.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://psychology.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=fjcrosby">Faye Crosby</a>, distinguished professor of psychology and provost of Cowell College, received the Lifetime Achievement Award. As a scholar, she is best known for her work on affirmative action, as well as diversity issues in education and business.</p>
<p>Crosby discovered a phenomenon called &#8220;the denial of personal disadvantage,&#8221; which revealed how people imagine themselves to be exempt from injustices that affect their group. The insight fueled her commitment to affirmative action&#8212;and later, to mentoring as a strategy to bring about change in the workplace.</p>
<p>Associate professor of history <a href="http://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=danthony">David H. Anthony III</a> was honored for for his leadership inside and outside the classroom, as well as in the community.&#160;As a scholar, Anthony&#8217;s focus is on African and African-American history, art, music, literature, and cinema, as well as African diaspora studies. He also serves as emcee for the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation. A former provost of Oakes College, his legacy includes helping to establish a service-learning program, as well as a peer-to-peer mentorship program.</p>
<p><a href="http://cowell.ucsc.edu/advising/ContactHours/whoarewe.html">Ethan Hutchinson</a>, lead academic preceptor for Cowell College, has emerged as a strong and powerful voice for social justice since joining campus a few years ago. He has organized welcome events for traditionally underserved communities, including Educational Opportunity Program participants, international and out-of-state students, and LGBTQ+ students, as well as developed a Bystander Intervention Training and an interactive Academic Integrity Seminar.</p>
<p><a href="http://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/detail.php?type=people&amp;uid=ricki">Ricki Carr</a>, lead senior analyst in the Enterprise Financial Systems unit, started the Staff Diversity Group after being in the first cohort to complete the campus&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program in 2010. Carr also had the idea to launch a campus-wide campaign to promote the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a>, an effort that&#8217;s reached nearly everyone on campus.</p>
<p>Joanna Bucio Villase&#241;or, an undergraduate student from Oakes College majoring in Molecular, Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology, was recognized for her participation in the California Alliance for Minority Participation, a statewide initiative that supports underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).</p>
<p>For the past two years, she has served as the president of the UC Santa Cruz chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Latinos and Native Americans in Science and has mentored her peers and helped build community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tishabohr.com">Tisha Emily Bohr</a>, a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Molecular, Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology, was honored for seeking out innovative and inclusive teaching practices, as well as for her work as outreach coordinator for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucscwise/">Women in Science and Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>She is engaged in the recruitment and retention of younger women, and has coordinated activities and workshops at local schools and conferences to encourage girls and young women to go into STEM fields. She also worked with the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and the Graduate Division to launch a Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program for graduate students.</p>
<p><a href="http://ucscgeodes.wix.com/home">GEODES</a>, a student organization made up of six graduate students in the Earth and Planetary Science department, was recognized for its work to enhance diversity in the geosciences by supporting students from all backgrounds and by raising awareness of diversity issues among students, faculty, postdocs, and staff.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://airc.ucsc.edu/student-resources/poc-sustainability-collective/index.html">People of Color Sustainability Collective</a> was founded to engage students of color in sustainability efforts&#8212;and to recognize contributions that were being overlooked. The collective was recognized for highlighting the work that communities of color have done to advance sustainability and for working to redefine sustainability to include diverse cultural interpretations.</p>
<p>The Women in Science and Engineering Award was given to <a href="http://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/detail.php?type=people&amp;uid=apaytan">Adina Paytan</a>, a research scientist in the Institute of Marine Sciences. She is a passionate advoacate for women and other underrepresented groups in STEM fields.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s recruited graduate students from her lab to reach out to high school girls in Salinas through Expanding Your Horizons, a science program that encourages girls to pursue STEM careers. They also teamed up with the High School Summer Intern program to bring 50 economically disadvantaged and underrepresented high school students to campus.</p>

<p>So maybe it wasn&#8217;t surprising that given a gun belt with handcuffs, inert pepper spray and a rubber handgun, she reacted as she did during a classroom scenario that was part of the UC Santa Cruz Police Department&#8217;s spring 2016 Citizens Police Academy. Sent out to investigate an abandoned golf cart as part of the scenario, she immediately encountered a man&#8212;another student acting the part&#8212;who shouted, &#8220;Hey, what are you doing with my vehicle?&#8221; Ordonez grabbed her gun and immediately pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how quickly these things happen, how quickly they can escalate, and how what you do can look to the public,&#8221; said&#160;Officer Nathaniel Calhoun, who was overseeing the scenario.</p>
<p>Ordonez was one of 31 students who graduated from the <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/get-involved/academy.html">Citizens Police Academy</a> in June. The nine-week program is offered three times a year to give a behind-the-scenes, hands-on perspective of the roles and responsibilities of law enforcement. The course covers such topics as community-oriented policing, crime classifications, constitutional rights, DUI/drug use, search and seizure, defensive tactics, and evidence processing.</p>
<p>In another scenario, psychology major Maddy Brokman drove a police cruiser with Chief Nader Oweis in the passenger seat. Told that the car in front of her might have been speeding, she turned on the overhead lights and signaled the driver to pull over. She parked, pulled the emergency brake, and got out to investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize just how much goes into a simple traffic stop,&#8221; Brokman said. &#8220;You have to make decisions in a split second. It&#8217;s much harder and more stressful than it looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>During another class, the students visited the Santa Cruz County Jail on Water Street. Brokman described that experience as &#8220;very surreal and disturbing&#8212;a little like a TV show and also like being at a zoo. They&#8217;re locked up, and we&#8217;re peering in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luis Arroyo, a fourth-year student majoring in sociology, said he appreciated getting an insider view into the world of public safety, and now he&#8217;s considering a career in law enforcement.</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t be the first graduate of the program to do that. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/police-ambassadors.html">Wesley Huynh</a>, who went on to become a <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/get-involved/student-ambassador.html">UC Santa Cruz police ambassador</a> after citizens academy, graduated last year with a degree in business management economics and is now a sworn officer with the Oakland Police Department.</p>
<p>Oweis has run the citizens academy since 2011, when he took over the department after serving 20 years with the UC Davis Police Department.</p>
<p>As part of the program, he said he wants to dispel misperceptions that policing is an easy job and demonstrate how service to the community is the overarching philosophy of the department.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stress critical thinking to understand the role of law enforcement as peacekeepers, caretakers, and enforcers of the law, when it is reasonable and prudent to enforce,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of all, we try to humanize the badge.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/police-ambassadors.html

UC Santa Cruz students will team with UCSC faculty and staff to improve campus and community food systems as part of the UC Global Food Initiative&#8217;s fellowship program.<br/>
<br/>
 Three graduate and two undergraduate students have received $4,000 UC Global Food Initiative (GFI) Fellowships for the 2016&#8211;2017 academic year, and will be involved in ongoing GFI projects at UCSC. These include efforts to improve student food security, expand experiential learning opportunities, and disseminate information on the campus&#8217;s work in agroecology.<br/>
<br/>
 Graduate students Keli Benko, Hamutahl Cohen, and Emily Reisman, and undergraduates Cassidy Carmichael and Anne Wiesenfeld are part of a cohort of GFI fellows from throughout the UC system who are advancing work to increase food system sustainability and improve food access and nutrition at the state, national, and international levels.<br/>
<br/>
 &#160;&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see what these five outstanding women will do as GFI fellows,&#8221; said Stacy Philpott, associate professor of environmental studies and interim director of the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS)</a>. &#8220;Their interests in food and farming are diverse, and they are all poised to make a difference for our university and community.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The five new UCSC GFI Fellowship recipients are:<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Keli Benko</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in sociology, is studying the way that new proposals to expand buffer zones for fumigant use around schools, hospitals, and day care centers in the Pajaro Valley would affect strawberry growers, farmworkers, and residents. While attending Cabrillo College and UC Berkeley, she developed an interest in sustainable food systems, and wrote an honors-winning thesis, &#8220;Table Talk: A History of Sustainable Food and Culinary Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1970-2012.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Her work as a GFI fellow will seek to clarify the positions of various stakeholders in regards to fumigant regulation and the future of the strawberry industry in the Pajaro Valley.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Cassidy Carmichael</strong> is an undergraduate majoring in environmental studies. An internship at Everett Family Farm helped spark an interest in becoming a farmer, and through the GFI Fellowship she plans to support ongoing agroecology, campus CSA, and campus farmers&#8217; market efforts. &#8220;As a student it is important to ensure that fellow classmates and people in the community have access to clean, healthy food and create a relationship with their community in supporting their local farmers and small businesses,&#8221; Carmichael says.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Hamutahl Cohen</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies, also received a GFI Fellowship in 2015. Her research on the landscape epidemiology of pathogens in domesticated and wild bees sits at the intersection of urban agroecology, pollinator conservation, and California food systems.<br/>
<br/>
 The research draws from her first-hand experiences as an undergraduate working with the Student Organic Garden Association (SOGA) at UC Berkeley and as an apprentice and then graduate student at UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Building on her work as a GFI Fellow in 2015, she is particularly interested in helping establish the Blum Center food hub with Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology, and in improving food security for UCSC students. &#8220;I would like to work towards creative solutions towards food insecurity at the UCSC campus that provide donated food to students while still preserving and honoring student dignity,&#8221; Cohen says.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Emily Reisman</strong> is a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies studying water and pollination resources with a focus on the agro-environmental history of California&#8217;s almond industry. Her background includes work with agroforestry projects in Togo and community seed banks in India, as well working with startups on projects to coordinate food waste recovery and improve food literacy.<br/>
<br/>
 As a GFI fellow, Reisman looks forward to contributing to a more just and sustainable campus community through engagements with food equity and experiential learning, as well as improving food literacy.&#160; &#8220;In particular I&#8217;m interested in fostering critical food literacy,&#8221; Reisman says, &#8220;a perspective that includes consideration not only of the environmental aspects of food production, but also of the conditions of food workers whose wellness is essential to a just and sustainable food system.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Anne Wiesenfeld</strong> is an undergraduate majoring in environmental studies, with a concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems. Her interest in the food system began in middle school when she worked to improve conditions for factory-farmed animals, and continued in high school with efforts to ban plastic grocery bags in Los Angeles. As a GFI fellow focused on food equity and sustainable food procurement projects, she hopes to better understand the sustainable food system process and its implications. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested not in how to continue the cycle of healthy food for those who can afford it, but incorporating those who can&#8217;t,&#8221; she says.<br/>

In recent years, attention has turned away from the fibrils themselves to an intermediate stage in the aggregation of amyloid beta. "Oligomers" consisting of a few molecules of the protein stuck together are more mobile than the large, insoluble fibrils and seem to be much more toxic.</p>
<p>The actual structure of these soluble oligomers remains unknown, however, and it's unclear how they trigger the neurotoxic effects that lead to Alzheimer's disease. A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz may help lift the veil on the structure and behavior of these neurotoxic oligomers.</p>
<p>The researchers made a subtle alteration to the amyloid beta protein that had striking effects on its properties. By replacing one amino acid with its mirror image, they created a version of amyloid beta with a reduced rate of fibril formation, different fibril structure, and increased toxicity in cell culture compared to the normal or "wild type" protein.</p>
<p>"We perturbed the system very slightly and got enhanced cytotoxicity and destabilization of fibrils," said Jevgenij Raskatov, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of a paper on the findings to be published in <em>Chemistry - A European Journal</em>. The <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201601763/abstract">accepted article has been posted online</a> prior to editing and formal publication of the final version of record.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Subtle change</strong></p>
<p>Most amino acids can occur in two mirror-image forms, a "left-handed" or L-form and a "right-handed" or D-form, but living cells only make proteins out of L-amino acids. Raskatov's team changed one amino acid in the amyloid beta protein to its D-form: the&#160; glutamate at position 22.</p>
<p>"This subtle change stabilizes a prefibrillary intermediate that has higher toxicity," he said, noting that the stable intermediate could be a very useful tool for investigating the neurotoxic effects of amyloid beta oligomers. The role of the amyloid beta protein in Alzheimer's disease is complicated and remains poorly understood. With a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, researchers hope to identify new targets for drug development efforts.</p>
<p>Several mutations associated with inherited early-onset Alzheimer's disease affect position 22 in the amyloid beta protein, either changing it from glutamate to another amino acid or deleting it. The new findings underscore the importance of the amino acid at position 22 for amyloid beta toxicity.</p>
<p>Raskatov's team--postdoctoral researchers Christopher Warner (first author) and Subrata Dutta and graduate student Alejandro Foley--used a variety of techniques to investigate the properties of the altered amyloid beta protein and the oligomers and fibrils it forms. Using small-angle x-ray scattering analysis, they found evidence that the protein forms a soluble oligomer with an ordered structure.</p>
<p>"The scattering experiment provided an indication of structure, and there is a chance we can use this information to gain some structural insights," Raskatov said. "We're pretty excited about that, because if we can understand the structure of the neurotoxic oligomers, that could help efforts to design molecules to disrupt them."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3b9adb168072701713dacb13e251fe2d"><name>conferencefeature2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz is a summer conference hotspot</title><summary>Whether you are interested in studying planets, dowsing the days away, or learning a brand-new cheerleading technique, thereâ€™s a UC Santa Cruz conference that will suit your needs.</summary><start-date>1465583400000</start-date><display-name>Summer conferences</display-name><path>/2016/06/conferencefeature2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/conferencefeature2016</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1465583850641</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465862265145</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/conferencegreatview.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/conferencegreatview.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>conferencegreatview.jpg</name><display-name>conferencegreatview.jpg</display-name><file-size>32609</file-size><width>375</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/conferenceupwardboundthumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/conferenceupwardboundthumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>conferenceupwardboundthumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>conferenceupwardboundthumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>17167</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>With stunning views like this, along with its strong academic reputation, it's no surprise that UC Santa Cruz is a hotspot for summer conferences.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/conferencemathscienceupwardbound.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/conferencemathscienceupwardbound.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>conferencemathscienceupwardbound.jpg</name><display-name>conferencemathscienceupwardbound.jpg</display-name><file-size>61376</file-size><width>375</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Be on the lookout for lots of youthful faces on campus during this summer conference season, including these Upward Bound participants.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>This season, the campus will welcome 109 groups comprising a total of 10,000 attendees. </article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz becomes a hotspot for conferences in the summertime. Whether you are interested in studying planets, dowsing the days away, or learning a brand-new cheerleading technique, there&#8217;s a conference that will suit your needs.</p>
<p>This season, the campus will welcome 109 groups comprising a total of 10,000 attendees.</p>
<p>Sandi Vargas, who oversees UC Santa Cruz conferences, says the campus&#8217;s ideal, forest-like setting is conducive to academic groups here who focus on higher learning, college preparation, and musical endeavors, as well as youth and sports camps. Groups range in size from 30 to 500, and classes are taking place in all kinds of venues, from small classrooms to large lecture halls.</p>
<p>Expect to see a lot of young people out and about; roughly 70 percent of the conferees are youths.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://conferenceservices.ucsc.edu/current/index.html">current list of conferences</a> puts a strong emphasis on college preparatory classes, including <a href="http://www.mpc.edu/student-services/specialized-programs/trio-programs/math-science-upward-bound">Upward Bound</a>, Trio, and Smart Choices,whose mission is to inspire a first-generation crop of new college-bound students from their underserved communities.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s offerings also include <a href="http://sustainableaged.org/conferences/2016-santa-cruz-ca/">a conference on the ecology of food systems</a>, sponsored by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). The conference has a strong focus on social justice, and will draw students from across the globe.</p>
<p>You will also find some one-of-a-kind options, including <a href="http://www.dowserswestcoast.org/">the West Coast Dowsing Conference in early July.</a> The group&#8217;s website defines dowsing as &#8220;an ancient art practiced throughout the world," and states that a dowser communicates with the universe through the use of mind, body, and unique tools such as pendulums and L-rods. This seasoned group encompasses 20-somethings as well as people well into their 80s and even their 90s, sharing a strong focus on metaphysics as well as mindfulness.</p>
<p>Dowsing is one way of connecting with nature, and so is the painstaking art of science illustration. The Guild of Natural Science Illustrators is putting on a conference this year that runs July 3&#8211;9. Check out their website if you want to see <a href="https://www.gnsi.org/">some truly stunning art featuring wildlife</a>. Among the lineup of speakers will be the highly respected illustrator and &#8220;nature journaling evangelist&#8221; John Muir Laws. (Laws, by the way,&#160; is not related to the legendary writer, mountaineer and pioneering environmentalist John Muir; Laws's mother, who worked as a lawyer for the Sierra Club, named Laws after him.)</p>
<p>As usual, the rock 'n&#8217; roll summer camp, Soundwall, will give students as young as 6 a chance to rock out and have a fine time in the process. The Soundwall Music program provides intensive training on guitar, bass, vocals, and keyboard and culminates with an impressive concert performance at the university's Recital Hall.&#160; <a href="http://www.rockcamp.org/#%21videos/citr">Those who might wish to enroll can watch some high-energy music videos featuring Soundwall students in action</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ussportscamps.com">Nike Sports Camps</a> once again bring their varied youth sports camps, representing a wide spectrum including football, basketball, swimming, lacrosse, running, rugby, and tennis. &#160;And UC Santa Cruz is also a place for practicing <a href="https://usa.varsity.com">cheerleaders</a>, who will return to campus to spread the team spirit once again.</p>
<p>The conference season is a boon for conference-goers, and also benefits UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#160;The average gross revenue of over $4.5 million from the conferences, generated within a 10-week period, goes to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s housing system and helps offset student housing costs during the academic year. It also provides jobs for student staff members who help coordinate the groups and keeps custodians, dining staff, and other campus service providers employed during the summer.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3bd4d3da8072701713dacb130e58ef2f"><name>renew-parking-permits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Time to renew parking permits and Metro bus passes  </title><summary>Annual parking permits and staff/faculty Metro bus passes expire on June 30, 2016. </summary><start-date>1465282800000</start-date><display-name> Time to renew parking permits and Metro bus passes  </display-name><path>/2016/06/renew-parking-permits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/renew-parking-permits</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1465587650088</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465587650088</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>Annual parking permits and staff/faculty Metro bus passes&#160;expire on June 30, 2016.

<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz attacked this problem by focusing on perovskite nanocrystals, in which the instability problems are magnified by the large surface area of the particles relative to their volume. Atoms on the surface are vulnerable to reactions that can degrade the material, so molecules that bind to the surface--called surface ligands or capping ligands--are used both to stabilize perovskite nanocrystals and to control their properties.</p>
<p>In a paper <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201602236/full">published June 13 in <em>Angewandte Chemie</em></a>, the UCSC researchers reported the results of experiments using unique branched ligands to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals with greatly improved stability and uniform particle size.</p>
<p>"This new strategy to stabilize organometal-halide perovskites is an important step in the right direction," said corresponding author Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. "Our hope is that this could be used not only for perovskite nanocrystals but also for bulk materials and thin films used in applications such as photovoltaics."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Capping ligands</strong></p>
<p>Zhang's team tested the effects of different types of capping ligands on the stability of perovskite nanocrystals. Conventional perovskite nanocrystals capped with ligands consisting of long straight-chain amines show poor stability in solvents such as water and alcohol. Zhang's lab identified unique branched molecules that proved much more effective as capping ligands.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, the branching structure of the ligands protects the surface of the nanocrystals by occupying more space than straight-chain molecules, creating a mechanical barrier through an effect known as steric hindrance. "The branching molecules are more cone-shaped, which increases steric hindrance and makes it harder for the solvent to access the surface of the nanocrystals," he said.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to control the size of the nanocrystals by adjusting the amount of branched capping ligands used during synthesis. They could obtain uniform perovskite nanocrystals in sizes ranging from 2.5 to 100 nanometers, with high photoluminescence quantum yield, a measure of fluorescence that is critical to the performance of perovskites in a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Zhang's lab is exploring the use of perovskite nanocrystals in sensors to detect specific chemicals. He is also working with UC Santa Cruz physicist Sue Carter on the use of perovskite thin films in photovoltaic cells for solar energy applications.</p>

<p>The $100,000 grant to Manduchi is the first RPB/RDPFS Innovations in Technology Low Vision Research Award. Manduchi is developing an economical and easy-to-use screen magnifier for people with low vision. The award supports solutions for people with remaining functional vision rather than those who are totally blind, with a focus on mobile and wearable innovations that can be implemented on multiple platforms, such as electronic tablets or phones.</p>
<p>Manduchi's project will use an eye-tracking system to control screen magnification, so that the part of the display that is magnified is determined by where the viewer is looking, rather than by using a mouse or trackpad. He said the use of &#8220;gaze-dependent displays&#8221; is not a new idea, but these systems tend to be expensive and require special hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to have a compact, affordable system that works on an ordinary laptop or tablet using the built-in camera,&#8221; Manduchi said. &#8220;By moving the magnification location as you move your eyes, it becomes automatic and seamless. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Manduchi is tackling an extremely important problem for those with low vision: frequent losses of place on highly magnified views of the screen,&#8221; said Susan Olivo, executive director of RDPFS. &#8220;This is the kind of new solution to a widely experienced problem that we hoped would emerge from our partnership with RPB.&#8221;</p>
<p>Low vision refers to chronic impairment that is not correctable by eyeglasses, medicines, or surgery. Many eye disorders can lead to low vision, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Injury to the eye or to a portion of the brain involved in sight can also produce low vision. Low vision significantly and negatively impacts a person&#8217;s visual activities of daily living and quality of life. The National Eye Institute estimated that 3 million U.S. persons suffered low vision in 2010, with projections that this number would increase to nearly 5 million in 2030 and 9 million in 2050.</p>
<p>Research to Prevent Blindness, in partnership with the Lions Clubs International Foundation and Reader&#8217;s Digest Partners for Sight Foundation, announced the first grantees in its $1.2 million, two-pronged research initiative to address urgent needs in understanding and treating low vision on June 10. Separate awards will fund researchers working on ways to improve the brain&#8217;s ability to take information from a compromised visual system and create vision, and on technology solutions to make daily tasks easier for those with vision loss.</p>
<p>According to Brian F. Hofland, president of RPB, the Low Vision Initiative emerged from internal discussions on underserved areas of vision research and how the organization might address those needs. &#8220;We are hoping to shine a spotlight on and increase attention to low vision issues and to make a difference for millions of people whose quality of life is significantly and negatively impacted by this often neglected condition,&#8221; Hofland said. &#8220;Our aim is to provide seed money for innovative thinking, and our funding partners share the same objectives.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4c0ad4bc8072701713dacb130937511b"><name>commencement-feature-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A day in the sun for UC Santa Cruz grads</title><summary>As they awaited to receive their diplomas, UC Santa Cruz scholars reflected on friendship, mentors and inspiration. </summary><start-date>1465858800000</start-date><display-name>Commencement 2016</display-name><path>/2016/06/commencement-feature-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/commencement-feature-2016</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1465859624801</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1466463185195</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/commencemasterseducation.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/commencemasterseducation.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>commencemasterseducation.jpg</name><display-name>commencemasterseducation.jpg</display-name><file-size>36627</file-size><width>234</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/commencethumbnail80</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/commencethumbnail80</link><site>news</site><name>commencethumbnail80</name><display-name>commencethumbnail80</display-name><file-size>16313</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Laura Acantar, after receiving her master's in education and her teaching certificate, will teach at the Watsonville elementary school where she was once a student.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/commencewellwishers.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/commencewellwishers.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>commencewellwishers.jpg</name><display-name>commencewellwishers.jpg</display-name><file-size>47327</file-size><width>350</width><height>234</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Family and friends came out in droves to give their regards to the graduates.

Another professed: &#8220;The courage to change the things I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has always been a combination of intellectual heft and quirk, so it made sense that graduates wore Bermuda shorts beneath their gowns and leis around their necks. It was hard to blame them, considering the balmy temperatures.</p>
<p>Ceremonies for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 10 colleges, graduate division, and Baskin School of Engineering, took place June 10-13 with 3,330 undergraduate and 175 graduate students participating. In all, more than 4,700 UCSC students earned undergraduate and graduate degrees during the 2015-2016 academic year.</p>
<p>Some things never change: &#160;parents grumping about the uphill walk from their parked cars, and the fact that the shaded seats were jam-packed; sunny seats not so much.</p>
<p>But this year stood out in several ways. This was the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary edition of the graduate division commencement, which was much more well-attended than the first-ever ceremony a half century ago, when a single Ph.D. candidate arose to receive a diploma.</p>
<p>This year also had an unusual number of high-profile alumni taking the podium to deliver commencement addresses, including <em>New Yorker</em> writer William Finnegan (Cowell, &#8217;74, English literature) winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his memoir <em>Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</em>. Finnegan spoke to Cowell graduates Saturday afternoon. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Making dreams come true</strong></p>
<p>Another highly successful journalist&#8211;<em>Rolling Stone</em> writer and author Claire Hoffman (Kresge,'99, anthropology) urged graduating Kresge students to &#8220;give a little time and thought to your future self. I want you to conjure that being and then put them somewhere inside of you, where you can take care of them and tend to them for the years and decades to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoffman also urged Kresge graduates to remain true to themselves and their dreams&#8211;and shared sobering stories of rock stars who struggled with hidden torments.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I spent the evening with Amy Winehouse, three years before she died, I saw a 24-year-old girl who had an incredible dream and ambition but who had lost sight of it. She had hit up against reality&#8211;fame, addiction, success&#8211;and it was hurting her ...&#160; When I interviewed Prince, eight years ago, I saw a man who was conflicted about who he was and who he wanted to be.&#160; I saw somebody who, while incredibly talented, had a degree of self-loathing and repression that I wouldn&#8217;t wish on anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In light of those stories, she urged students to &#8220;hold on to your ideals, your dreams, your sense of self. &#160;But you also need to accept reality, and let it become an ingredient in your ambition, not something that opposes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another highly influential Slug journalist, Nikki Silva (Porter '73, aesthetic studies), radio producer and one half of the Peabody Award-winning public radio team, the Kitchen Sisters, addressed Porter students with a rousing talk about the power of collaboration and the importance of &#8220;sharing your passions and projects with others.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also addressed the importance of looking for cultural treasures, collaborators and inspiration where you live. &#8220;It&#8217;s all within 10 feet &#8230;&#8221; &#160;Silva said. &#8220;This commandment actually comes from my husband Charles who always says this when anything is needed or wanted and people are being tempted to go out searching far and wide.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also put forth a few other important credos for budding journalists, including this one: don&#8217;t be scared to talk to strangers and get their stories. Silva also told the crowd that &#8220;collaboration is king. Davia Nelson (her broadcasting partner, also a UCSC grad) &#160;and I have been collaborating for years with each other&#8211;urging each other on, bolstering each other, making each other laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A time to pay tribute</strong></p>
<p>Silva urged graduating Porter students to honor their elders: the mentors, the guiding hands, who showed them the way.</p>
<p>At the graduate division ceremonies at the East Field on Friday, Robert Majzler, getting ready to receive his Ph.D. in psychology and feminist studies, demonstrated that same spirit: paying tribute to a caring mentor who had a strong and nurturing influence on his life.</p>
<p>His guiding light was Professor Aaronette M. White, associate dean of equity and social responsibility in the Division of Social Sciences, who died at age 51 in 2012. She was a highly regarded professor of social psychology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe so much to her,&#8221; said Majzler, who held a framed photo of White in his hands as he prepared to walk out onto the field. &#8220;I was a proto-feminist before I met her but she totally expanded my notion of what is possible and who can be a feminist.&#8221;</p>
<p>White showed him how scholarship and activism could change the world, Majzler said. &#8220;This is bittersweet. I just know she&#8217;s here with me. I&#8217;m carrying her picture. Her legacy continues with us, her students.&#8221;</p>
<p>When White died, Majzler was so distraught, he considered discontinuing his studies. But then White&#8217;s mother reached out. &#8220;She sent me a card saying, &#8216;Rob, you meant a lot to Aaronette. You honor her by continuing the work you did together.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Scenes of joy and gratitude</strong></p>
<p>Everywhere you looked at the East Field, prior to the graduate division ceremonies, students shared stories of self-reinvention, of paying back to a community, of taking risks and pursuing ambitions.</p>
<p>Laura Acantar, on the verge of receiving her master&#8217;s degree in education, attended the Alianza Charter School in Watsonville as a child. Now she&#8217;s heading back to that school, this time as a second-grade teacher. &#8220;I always wanted to go into education because I wanted to see teachers who looked like me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Acantar is a strong believer in bilingual education. &#8220;It helped me value my language and culture,&#8217;&#8217; she said. Now she is teaching in a dual immersion program. &#8220;I just want to go back and be able to do for others what my teachers did for me,&#8217;&#8217; Acantar said.</p>
<p>Standing in the field house, the graduate students took the time to think about their missions, their purposes, the reason for the long hours of study and hard work.</p>
<p>Later, they listened in rapt attention that afternoon when Jennifer Gonzalez, associate professor of history of art and visual culture at UC Santa Cruz took the podium and addressed big questions that were already on the minds of the graduates: &#8220;why are we here? &#8230; What is to be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>In her words, the university is a place to ask &#8220;questions that matter, of thinking very specific thoughts, about the subtleties of art, poetry, literature, the limits of the physical universe, the biology of our oceans, the histories of our nations, the ecologies of our landscapes, the health and education of our children. &#8220;</p>
<p>She also urged them to cherish the moment: &#8220;&#8230; that is a truly remarkable thing: that at some crucial moment you each found that rare and ineffable, but palpable and real, internal commitment, internal drive, to create, to discover, to think original (and sometimes radical) thoughts, to speak the truth with precision and determination. You have already commenced, and today you fly forth.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucsantacruz/</url><title>More photos on the UC Santa Cruz Flickr page</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50f261a68072701713dacb13e801ca83"><name>summer-session-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Summer Session becoming the hot way to get ahead</title><summary>Summer Session is an educational boon for students, whether they are fulfilling their general education requirements or getting a jump on their college educations.</summary><start-date>1465941600000</start-date><display-name>summer session feature story </display-name><path>/2016/06/summer-session-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/summer-session-2016</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1465941908551</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465946173474</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/Summer session staff.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/Summer session staff.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Summer session staff.jpg</name><display-name>Summer session staff.jpg</display-name><file-size>66506</file-size><width>350</width><height>234</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/summersessionthumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/summersessionthumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>summersessionthumb80.jpg</name><display-name>summersessionthumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><div style="margin-left: 2em;">This Summer Session 2016 staff photo features, from the top, LR: Laura Wu-Ohlson, Monica Santiago, Monica Parikh, Camille Torres, Calvin Lu; bottom L-R - Jimmy Qiu, Jesse Huynh, Jennifer Gallacher, Jennifer Hamilton and Elizabeth Volz.&#160;</div></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Classes held during summer break are quickly becoming a popular option, helping students fulfill their degree requirements or even graduate in only three years.
</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s popular Summer Session program was once the &#8220;best kept secret&#8221; on campus, a low-profile but sure-fire way for students to get a jump on their college educations or make sure they got the classes they needed.&#160;Now the secret is out&#8212;and thousands of students are taking advantage of this educational boon.</p>
<p>Summer Session&#8212;a series of intensive classes held during the summer break&#8212;is quickly becoming a popular option that helps students fulfill their major requirements and or even &#8220;fast track&#8221; their education, enabling them to graduate in only three years.</p>
<p>In other words, Summer Session is as far as you can get from that outdated stereotype of &#8216;summer school equals bummer school.&#8217; &#160;</p>
<p>Instead, &#8220;it's a chance to get way ahead&#8221; says Monica Parikh, who oversees Summer Session for UC Santa Cruz.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s more flexible; students can complete classes in five weeks, still have time for work and vacation, or to study abroad while taking online classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>A modest sampling of the courses UC Santa Cruz offers every summer includes statistics, marine ecology, genetics, general and organic chemistry, calculus, computer programming, economics, natural history of the UCSC campus, introduction to film studies, screenwriting, preparatory musicianship, politics, and public speaking.</p>
<p>The campus prides itself on offering the classes current UC Santa Cruz students need to graduate; they are the priority. To that end, Summer Session is offering 250 classes this summer, including many specific classes that fill general education requirements. There are also online options&#8212;new initiative that has grown by leaps and bounds this year&#8212;and special classes offered by individual colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Making the most of summer</strong></p>
<p>However, offering needed classes for undergraduates is only one of the focuses of the multifaceted Summer Session.&#160; Motivated students can also use their summer as a means to &#8220;squeeze in a minor,&#8221; Parikh said.</p>
<p>Highly self-motivated incoming first-year and transfer students could opt to get a strong start on their education.&#160; Enrolling in Summer Session courses or the Summer Academy earns them credits even before they start in the fall, Parikh said.</p>
<p>Summer Academies &#8212; exclusively for new admits &#8212; will welcome over 200 students this July.&#160; Students will earn credits toward degree requirements, live in residence halls, and learn how to navigate &#160;campus life.</p>
<p>Summer Session has many courses geared to high school students who will be juniors or seniors in fall. &#160;They can earn UC credits over the summer and get a 50% tuition discount for each course. Not only that, but those credits are transferable to any UC campus or other university.</p>
<p>Summer Session now has high school students from the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas. The program also draws students from California&#8217;s southlands, as well as the east coast and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Three-year pathways to success</strong></p>
<p>Students have always had plenty of reasons to enroll in Summer Session, and now they have one more: a brand-new &#8220;three-year pathways&#8217;&#8217; program instituted this year.</p>
<p>In fact, the program is so new at this point that the campus does not have records of anyone who has officially followed this fast-track pathway just yet, but the ultimate goal is to have 5 percent of students systemwide pursuing an accelerated three-year program by summer 2017, according to Stacey Sketo-Rosener, assistant vice provost for undergraduate advising at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>So far, 12 departments have committed to designing their bachelor&#8217;s degree programs so students can finish their studies in three years instead of four, said Summer Session Director Parikh.</p>
<p>Those departments offering an accelerated pathways option&#8212;with help from Summer Session&#8212;include anthropology, art, business management and economics, environmental studies, film and digital media, history, legal studies, literature, politics, psychology, and sociology.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in this kind of fast tracking should be aware of a few stipulations. These &#8220;three-year pathways&#8221; work best for single-major students who decide not to change their major. Those who take this route are advised to fulfill their entry-level writing requirement by the end of their first term, and commit themselves to enrolling in Summer Session after their first and second years.&#160;</p>
<p>For many students, the attraction to the three-year pathway will be financial.&#160; By paying tuition, fees, and housing for fewer quarters, the cost of earning a degree can be less. And by graduating early to start graduate school or the career path, students can maximize their lifetime earnings. "Whether you take a class for your major, or to explore an interest, there is something special about summer at UCSC,&#8221; noted Parikh, &#8220;the small classes, the personal attention, students get a campus experience not found any other time of the year.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="511929928072701713dacb13bf1aef9e"><name>health-center-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Services closing 2 p.m. Wednesdayâ€”8 a.m. Friday</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Student Health Services (HC, SHOP and CAPS) will close at 2 p.m. Wednesday, June 15, and reopen 8 a.m. Friday, June 17, due to planned power outage in the Student Health Services building complex. </summary><start-date>1465801200000</start-date><display-name>Student Health Services closing 2 p.m. Wednesdayâ€”8 a.m. Friday</display-name><path>/2016/06/health-center-closure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/health-center-closure</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1465944450117</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465944613797</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The UC Santa Cruz Student Health Services (HC, SHOP and CAPS)</span>&#160;will close at <span tabindex="0"><span>2 p.m.</span></span> <span tabindex="0"><span>Wednesday, June 15,</span></span> and reopen 8 a.m. <span tabindex="0"><span>Friday, June 17,</span></span> due to planned power outage in the&#160;Student Health Services&#160;building complex.</p>

 This violence targeted members of the LGBTQ community in a place of celebration, a place that should have been a safe space. This hate-filled act compels us to recommit to building a strong, unified, supportive community&#8212;one in which everyone enjoys the safety and freedom to be themselves.<br/>
 <br/>
 News of this tragedy is difficult to process. I encourage students who wish to speak with someone to contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 831-459-2628. For faculty and staff, support is available through the Employee Assistance Program at <span><a href="tel:866-808-6205" target="_blank" value="+18668086205">866-808-6205</a></span>.<br/>

 UC Santa Cruz is not immune to hate- and bias-related incidents. Embracing our differences and supporting each other takes effort, but it's worth it. It's the path to the world we want to live in.

<p>Fortino Morales III, 28, worked with CASFS after graduating from UC Riverside in 2011. As an undergraduate, he founded UCR's community garden, established the garden&#8217;s first student-run course, the Urban Garden Seminar, and ushered through a student referendum to fund sustainability engagement. He later returned to UC Riverside as the first manager overseeing the 3-acre sustainable community garden called R&#8217; Garden.</p>
<p>The 30 Under 30 awards recognize 30 young pioneers and innovators inside and outside the UC system who have made outstanding contributions to a wide array of food-related fields, including food production, food access and security, food sourcing, food education and communication, and food policy and public impact.</p>
<p>UC President Janet Napolitano started the awards to highlight and amplify the work being done by 30 young leaders and further encourage dialogue about food education, access and security, health and sustainability, in line with the initiative&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>The honorees were selected through a comprehensive nomination and review process, with a selection committee of industry leaders and influential voices in the food movement, both from within the UC system and the broader public.<br/>
<br/>
 Napolitano launched the Global Food Initiative in 2014 to develop, demonstrate and export solutions that help put the world on a path to sustainably and nutritiously feeding itself. &#8220;Food is at the heart of issues related to sustainability, climate security and healthy communities,&#8221; Napolitano said.</p>
<p>The initiative involves all 10 UC campuses, UC&#8217;s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Lawrence&#160; Berkeley National&#160; Laboratory. It is guided by a systemwide working group appointed&#160; by Napolitano and the UC chancellors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://30under30.universityofcalifornia.edu/</url><title>Global Food Initiative 30 under 30</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/37945</url><title>UCRâ€™s Fortino Morales III Wins the Global Food Initiative 30 Under 30 Award For His Work with Râ€™Garden</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5b7b7f8d8072701713dacb13469b7207"><name>reading-list-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Rebels and visionaries' are the focus of Social Sciences' summer reading list</title><summary>From farmer to feminist, hacker, judge, surfer, scientist, geologist, and community organizerâ€“meet the people who dared to think and act differently in the Division of Social Sciencesâ€™ Second Annual Summer Reading List.</summary><start-date>1466118900000</start-date><display-name>Social Sciences' reading list 2016</display-name><path>/2016/06/reading-list-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/reading-list-2016</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1466118666782</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1466120288810</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/reading-list-2016-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/reading-list-2016-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reading-list-2016-400.jpg</name><display-name>reading-list-2016-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>206073</file-size><width>500</width><height>502</height></image><image-alt>book cover collage</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/reading-list-2016-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/reading-list-2016-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reading-list-2016-80.jpg</name><display-name>reading-list-2016-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8689</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover collage</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>These are some of the titles selected by students, staff, faculty, and alumni for the second annual Social Sciences summer reading list.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6bc50e22-5b7c-bee7-702a-f6684b201d66"><span>From farmer to feminist, hacker, judge, surfer, scientist, geologist, and community organizer&#8211;meet the people who dared to think and act differently in</span> <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/reading/2016.html"><span></span><span>the Division of Social Sciences&#8217; Second Annual Summer Reading List</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Rebels and Visionaries&#8221; is the theme for 2016, inspired from the division&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/EonDADhZ_w4?t=5m17s"><span></span><span>Dream is Still Alive</span></a> <span>video. We asked students, faculty, staff, and alumni from the social sciences to share a book about an inspiring person or a provocative idea, a social movement or an influential leader. Who questioned authority? Who pioneered a bold concept? Who sought social, political, economic, or environmental change?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The suggestions form a rich collection that crosses disciplines and spans decades.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Chancellor George Blumenthal recommended</span> <em>Go East Young Man</em> <span>(Random House, 1974), the memoir of U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas&#8217; pre-judicial life. Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences and a professor in the environmental studies department suggests Rachel Carson&#8217;s</span> <em>Silent Spring</em> <span>(Houghton Mifflin, 1962), one of the first books to raise awareness about environmental problems to a wider public.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Others recommendations include recent Pulitzer prize winner</span> <span><em>Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</em>,</span> <span>by alum and now</span> <em>New Yorker</em> <span>writer, William Finnegan (Cowell, '74, English literature) and</span> <em>Saving Capitalism</em> <span>by former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,</span><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/reich-visit.html"><span></span><span>who spoke to the UC Santa Cruz community earlier this year</span></a> <span>about politics and capitalism. Distinguished UC Santa Cruz professor Bettina Aptheker&#8217;s memoir,</span> <em>Intimate Politics: How I Grew Up Red, Fought for Free Speech and Became A Feminist Rebel</em> <span>was also suggested for its relevance today.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additional suggestions acknowledge the previous generation that helped inspire the next.</span></p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In her first few months on the job, University Archivist Teresa Mora has set out to change the way faculty, staff, and student organizations handle the dusty piles of accumulated papers and digital folders stashed away on forgotten hard drives.</p>
<p>For Mora, the first person to hold the newly created position of campus archivist, the essence of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 51-year story is in the details&#8212;the newsletters, meeting minutes, images, correspondence, and dog-eared reports stashed away in forgotten boxes.</p>
<p>Her campuswide campaign is aimed at reminding people that one&#8217;s recycle bin could be an <a href="http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/speccoll/university-archives">archival treasure</a>. People often think their documents don&#8217;t matter but these seemingly mundane pieces of history may illuminate the unique history of the campus, Mora said.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is really a very special place, and it&#8217;s amazing how that comes through in the documents,&#8221; Mora said. &#8220;It may be a single folder of materials dropped off in my mailbox or dozens of cartons offered by a retiring faculty or staff member. My biggest concern is getting myself out there and making sure people understand I&#8217;m a resource.&#8221;</p>
<p>To amass and organize materials for campus posterity is no small task, especially at the end of the year as retirees prepare to leave campus, and staff and faculty work to clear the clutter of a busy year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original culture and its very intimate campus communities have allowed for lot of creativity and very unique programs to come out of UCSC,&#8221; Mora said. &#8220;I want to make sure those stories aren&#8217;t forgotten. It&#8217;s really easy for people to throw something in the recycling bin, but in 40 years&#8217; time, it might be the thing that really tells the story of the campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of particular interest are the programs that were cutting edge offerings when they were first created and reflected the culture of the campus, such as Feminist Studies, Community Studies, the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the Chicano Latino Research Center, and the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory.</p>
<p>The new wave of archival practice involves organizing the massive amount of digital content now created, which may involve capturing old websites and digital correspondence, as well as photos, video, and audio files.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t take everything but we want to have the broadest potential for storytelling,&#8221; said Elizabeth Cowell, Richard L. Press University Librarian and Presidential Chair.</p>
<p>While the university has a diverse trove of special collections and has collected pieces of campus history over the years, this is the first time the university has had its own dedicated archivist to build a more comprehensive campus story. The importance of the position became critically apparent as the campus prepared for last year&#8217;s 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>The long-awaited position was made possible through a generous donation by the Webster Family Foundation, which endowed the university librarian position through the Presidential Chair program of the University of California Office of the President. Alec Webster (&#8217;02, College Eight) and his wife, Claudia Webster, wanted the gift to create the university archivist position as they have a particular interest in campus history. The gift is part of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which&#160;supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future.</p>
<p>Long-standing campus benefactors, the Websters have contributed to many vital campus projects including the renovation and programming for the Cowell Hay Barn at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Collections are arranged and described for use by the campus community, outside researchers, and the general public. Many of them are digitally available as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The impact of this position is far more valuable than the amount of the gift,&#8221; Cowell said.</p>
<p>In addition to documenting the past, Mora is trained to identify key materials of the campus story as it unfolds. She scans the calendars for campus events to make sure documentation makes its way to the archives.</p>
<p>&#8220;What people are creating is important to the historic record,&#8221; Mora said. &#8220;If you start wondering whether or not something is important or not, you can contact me and I can walk through that with you. That&#8217;s my job: to assess whether or not it&#8217;s something that should be saved for posterity.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5b92d7618072701713dacb13e790b1ce"><name>meditation-sessions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Meditation sessions open to campus community</title><summary>The sessions are free and open to faculty, staff, and students.

<p>Now, Houser (College Eight &#8217;16, MCD biology) is being honored for her dedication and outstanding work; she is this year&#8217;s recipient of the prestigious Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.</p>
<p>The Steck is the highest academic award for undergraduate academic achievement at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Houser, 22, worked under the mentorship of two MCD biology faculty members: professor Bill Saxton and research scientist Inna Djagaeva on the project, which is titled "Editing of Kinesin Heavy Chain to Elucidate its Roles in Neurodegenerative Diseases."</p>
<p>Djagaeva was unstinting in her praise of Houser: &#8220;She&#8217;s one of the best students we&#8217;ve had,&#8221; Djagaeva said. &#8220;She is very dedicated and very passionate about research. I almost didn&#8217;t have to mentor her at all. After some initial training, she could do many things on her own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Djagaeva also praised Houser for going far beyond &#8220;simply following directions&#8221; by taking initiative and coming up with new ideas that were at the level of high-performing graduate students, and for taking a leadership role and training other students who were working on the project, mentioning that she was &#8220;highly qualified&#8221; to do the training.</p>
<p>Houser, Saxton and Djagaeva were recognized at the Chancellor's Undergraduate Awards Luncheon.</p>
<p>Houser worked as a part of a lab that studies the mechanisms and specific proteins that regulate muscle movement. By studying these mechanisms in fruit flies, the team is hoping to come away with a better understanding of degenerative muscle diseases. The lab studies &#8220;motor proteins&#8221; that transport proteins, mitochondria, and other organelles throughout the body, and how breakdowns in those proteins can lead to degenerative muscle diseases.</p>
<p>Houser&#8217;s project focused on using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool to develop mutations in the common fruit fly that mimic mutations found in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.&#160; CRISPR/Cas9 is a recently discovered gene-editing tool that has a higher specificity than any other previously used mechanism. This system is so new, there is still a lot of fine tuning to be done with it. Djagaeva and Houser spent a year optimizing this gene-editing tool that could be used to solve a number of genetic diseases in the future.</p>
<p>And while Houser&#8217;s work is extremely complex, her reaction to the reward was very simple and straightforward: She was shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was totally out of the blue,&#8217;&#8217; Houser said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has a longstanding tradition of keeping the Steck Award winner&#8217;s name a closely guarded secret right up to the last second. Such was the case last week. But Houser thought something a little bit fishy was going on when she saw that Saxton had walked to the podium to introduce the winner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering to myself: Why is he up there, and why is he announcing the winner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon enough, she found out that his presence up there at the front of the room was no coincidence.</p>
<p>Houser, who hails from Santa Maria, has an interest in sciences that dates back to when she was a little girl. A friend of the family used to take her into fields where Houser would study plants and birds and painstakingly &#8220;put owl pellets back together.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, she had no idea that cellular biology was going to be her favorite topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I realized, from an early age, that science was going to be really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73), who sits on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Board of Trustees, was part of the distinguished selection committee that chose to recognize Houser&#8217;s project. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6f2553be8072701713dacb13610517ce"><name>overtime-compensation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2016-2017 annual overtime compensation election for represented non-exempt employees</title><summary>During the month of June, for the departments/units that continue to offer the option of compensatory time, employees in the bargaining units listed above can make a change to their current overtime compensation election. </summary><start-date>1466406000000</start-date><display-name>Annual overtime compensation election</display-name><path>/2016/06/overtime-compensation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/overtime-compensation</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1466448563724</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1466454331141</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The month of June is the annual overtime compensation election period for represented non-exempt employees in the following bargaining units:</p>

<p>During the month of June, for the departments/units that continue to offer the option of compensatory time, employees in the bargaining units listed above can make a change to their current overtime compensation election. To make this change, the employee must file a written indication of preference to receive compensatory time off (CTO) for overtime hours worked. The effective date of change for this election period is July 3, 2016.</p>
<p>If an employee wishes to make a change to their current overtime compensation election, the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/forms/shr-2041.pdf">2016/2017 Annual Overtime Election Form</a> must be completed and submitted to their <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">Staff Human Resources Operations Specialist</a>, no later than June 30, 2016. Employees who do not return an election form will have their current preference for CTO or pay continued.</p>
<p>Employees in the following units are not being asked to complete an overtime election form at this time because their labor agreement does not require a June election:</p>

A 66-year-old Southern California litigator and actress named Terry is ill with the same malady.</p>
<p>The two women have never met, but a series of six-degrees-of-separation events has resulted in a <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3757">free, upcoming performance of a one-woman play titled <em>The Voice Bank</em></a>, which deals with the struggles and lessons of living with ALS. The performance will be at 2 p.m. July 9 at the UC Santa Cruz DANM Digital Arts Resource Center Room 108.</p>
<p>&#8220;This play is a little bit about making your own rules and defining your own health and the question of who owns the knowledge of your body,&#8221; says Andrea Caban, 39, a professor of speech and voice and an actress who not only wrote the play based on her own experiences but will perform the work as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also,&#8221; she says, &#8220;about letting go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavanelli, who taught a variety of subjects at UC Santa Cruz including popular classes on female physiology and the biology of AIDS, was a dedicated athlete before she was diagnosed with ALS 2 1/2 years ago. She&#8217;d entered 15 Ironman-length triathlons (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run) and ran a number of marathons, including a 2011 half-marathon in Antarctica. She was one of those competitors who might never stand on the winner&#8217;s podium but who pushed her way through whatever hardship the race threw her way.</p>
<p>Now, according to her sister, 55-year-old Terry Zavanelli Koenig, of Concord, Zavanelli is unable to walk, needs assistance with just about every part of life, and speaks mostly with the help of technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;ALS is probably the most vicious disease I&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; Koenig says. &#8220;It truly robs a person of everything except mind and spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease each year. Its most famous sufferers are physicist Stephen Hawking and baseball player Lou Gehrig.</p>
<p>Zavanelli, however, still loves visitors, watching movies, buying plants for her extensive garden, going to physical therapy, and the companionship and care of her two phenomenal caregivers, says her sister. The announcement that plans were in the works to bring <em>The Voice Bank</em> to UC Santa Cruz resulted in a smile of &#8220;pure joy,&#8221; Koenig says.</p>
<p>Caban, who teaches at California State University, Long Beach, along with running a private practice as a vocal coach, said the play came from her work with a woman she identified only as Terry.</p>
<p>Terry had come to her before her ALS diagnosis, but when she received the news of her illness she began working with Caban to develop a way of speaking that allowed her to overcome some of the effects of the disease on her vocal tract.</p>
<p>&#8220;We called it her &#8216;Voice Number Two,&#8217;&#8221; Caban says of the accented speech style they created that Terry still uses today.</p>
<p>As they worked together, Caban and Terry also grew close, and Caban began to feel the emotional effects of watching her friend face what is always a terminal disease. Caban, an award-winning actress with three one-woman shows on her resume, wrote a play that deals not only with the innovative vocal work the two women did but also about the outward-rippling effects of ALS.</p>
<p>It was a series of fortunate events that brought the play to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In the audience, as Caban gave the play&#8217;s debut performance at California State University, Long Beach, last October, were Terry Zavanelli Koenig and Zavanelli&#8217;s niece, Nicole Koenig, who is working on a master&#8217;s degree in the theater management and business administration departments at Cal State Long Beach. The Koenigs were so moved by the performance, they told Mary about the play.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of Abbi Davis, UC Santa Cruz associate director of development, physical and biological sciences, <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3757">the play will now be performed on the UC Santa Cruz campus</a> with Mary Zavanelli and her family among those in the audience. The play is open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;To go from independence to full dependence requires so much trust in others,&#8221; Terry Koenig says. &#8220;I think Mary&#8217;s determination (to cope) comes from her races. From falling down and getting back up and still racing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by the dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences along with the Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology departments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fcf09b18072701713dacb13b475782b"><name>orlando-altar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus altar honors lives lost in Orlando</title><summary>The CantÃº Queer Center, the Chicano Latino Resource Center, and the Womenâ€™s Center have created an altar that will be on display through July.

The university's Whistleblower Policy provides multiple avenues for employees to bring forward concerns of potential employee misconduct. Faculty and staff are encouraged to bring forward concerns about possible improper governmental activity directly to their supervisor, department head, locally designated official (LDO) or other appropriate university offices or officials.<br/>
 <br/>
 The university established a systemwide independently operated whistleblower hotline to allow for calls or web-based reporting from faculty, staff and students with a provision for anonymous reporting. The hotline relays the reported concerns to appropriate university officials for processing. This hotline is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours per day and is capable of receiving reports in a number of different languages.<br/>
 <br/>
 The university-wide toll-free number is 1-800-403-4744. Web-based reports can be made by accessing <a href="#">http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline</a>. More information about the whistleblower process can be found on the <a href="www.ucop.edu/uc-whistleblower/index.html">UC Whistleblower website</a>, the <a href="http://whistleblower.ucsc.edu/index.html">UCSC Whistleblower website</a> and on posters displayed in various employee areas. The university's whistleblower poster identifies other channels for reporting improper governmental activity, including the California State Auditor, the California Attorney General and locations for reporting fraud and abuse involving federal programs.<br/>
 <br/>
 The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a brochure from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.

<p>The competition, held in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/takeover">Electronics Entertainment Expo</a> (E3), the world's largest computer and video game event, challenged student game designers to develop new game ideas that promote positive and sustainable social connection among users, particularly for people age 50 and older.</p>
<p>"This is a big achievement for the team, and a significant honor for the program," said Michael John, director of the UCSC Games and Playable Media master's degree program. "We're especially pleased because the competition was outside the usual game design parameters, and the team did some impressive research on the demographic they were designing for, including their existing gaming habits, the hardware and software they typically have access to, and their motivations."</p>
<p>The team, called <a href="http://trainwreckgames.com">Trainwreck Games</a>, consists of graduate students Pedro Cori, Alexander Formoso, and Cong Liu. Their game proposal, <em>Letters of Mystery</em>, is a cooperative email-based "escape the room" adventure. Escape the room games in the physical world involve a group of players locked in a room who have to find clues and solve puzzles together to unlock the door. In <em>Letters of Mystery,</em> players work together in groups to complete objectives, getting clues from a server and discussing actions to take among themselves before submitting answers.</p>
<p>The team decided that using email as a platform made the most sense for the target demographic. "Most adults over 50 use email, but they don't necessarily want to install apps or register for gaming sites," Cori said.</p>
<p>The students also learned from their research that competitiveness tends to decrease with age, and people start to look for more intellectually challenging games. "So we came up with the idea of escape the room games, which are age-neutral, cooperative games played in groups, and thought about how we could adapt them to this medium," Cori said.</p>
<p>They didn't have to create a working prototype for the competition, but the team did create a detailed mock-up of the game for pitching it to the judges. <em>Letters of Mystery</em> was a side project for the Trainwreck Games team, which has been focused on their capstone project for the master's program, a game called <a href="http://trainwreckgames.com/projects"><em>Ulama: Arena of the Gods</em></a>.</p>
<p>The AARP/ESA Social Connection GameJam was produced with the support of the Higher Education Video Game Alliance (HEVGA).</p>
<p>AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said games can help family and friends stay connected with one another. "The Social Connection GameJam demonstrates the innovative ways that video games foster social connections and enable us to keep in touch with each other," she said. "AARP congratulates GameJam finalists for their creativity in bringing to life new games that foster social interaction."</p>
<p>"The AARP/ESA Game Jam was an unprecedented opportunity for our industry's next generation of video game developers to push boundaries and expand the understanding of who plays video games," said Michael D. Gallagher, president and CEO of ESA, which represents the U.S. video game industry and owns E3.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="748fb7798072701713dacb13b31a3ea8"><name>star-trek-opera-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sci-fi meets soprano with Star Trek opera</title><summary>UC Santa Cruzâ€“affiliated professors and staff are boldly going where no one has gone before by taking Star Trek into the high-culture realm of arias and recitatives.</summary><start-date>1466539200000</start-date><display-name>Star Trek opera</display-name><path>/2016/06/star-trek-opera-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/star-trek-opera-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1466539422190</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1568302928445</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/star-trek-one.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/star-trek-one.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>star-trek-one.jpg</name><display-name>star-trek-one.jpg</display-name><file-size>63927</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/star-trek-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/star-trek-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>star-trek-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>star-trek-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15312</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lincoln and Lee Taiz wrote the libretto for the Star Trek-based opera.

<div></div></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8211;affiliated professors and staff are boldly going where no one has gone before by taking <em>Star Trek</em> into the high-culture realm of arias and recitatives.</p>
<p>Some sci-fi buffs think of <em>Star Trek</em>, Gene Roddenberry&#8217;s wildly successful television and movie series, as a "space opera&#8221;&#8212;in other words, a broad, splashy melodrama that takes place in other galaxies.</p>
<p>But Captain Kirk and Mister Spock have never had a chance to sing their lungs out in an actual <em>Star Trek</em> opera&#8212;until now, that is.</p>
<p>Thanks to the creativity of a diverse group of professors, staff members, and their associates, <em>Star Trek&#160;</em>has been turned into a real opera.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re curious to see what happens when you mix Vulcans, tenors, warp speed, phasers, and mezzo sopranos, here is your chance: A free &#8220;workshop performance&#8221; of the first act of the opera,&#160; with an orchestra and electronic back-up, takes place June 26 at 7:30 at the UC Santa Cruz Music Center Recital Hall. It&#8217;s a rare opportunity to experience an opera under construction.</p>
<p>This workshop performance, which presents the first act of the opera, is a way to try out and gather feedback as the creators work to shape it into its final form.&#160;</p>
<p><em>Star Trek</em> superfans should be pleased to know that the opera&#8217;s director is John De Lancie, who played the villainous and powerful Q, antagonist of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>.</p>
<p>And though <em>Menagerie: The Trial of Spock</em> is a full-fledged opera, the running time, for this one-time-only performance of the first act is just 45 minutes.</p>
<p>It is a special-effects-free dress rehearsal, so transporters, prosthetic pointy ears, and devastating phaser blasts will not be a part of this production.</p>
<p><strong>The trek to an opera</strong></p>
<p>This opera has deep roots that go all the way back to the tumultuous 1960s, when one of the project&#8217;s creators&#8212;renowned plant biologist and science writer Lincoln Taiz, now an emeritus professor at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;became a lifelong Trekkie.</p>
<p>Taiz wrote the libretto for the opera along with his wife, Lee. Early in the writing process, David Cope, a long-time friend of Taiz in the UC Santa Cruz Music Department, suggested fellow UC Santa Cruz professor of music Ben Carson, as a possible composer for the &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; opera. Carson liked the idea, and soon he and Taiz joined forces and became fast friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it's been one of the most joyous collaborations of my life,&#8221; Carson said. &#8220;Linc and Lee put together a greatly enhanced version of Roddenberry's story ... as creative intellects they've merged the world of <em>Star Trek</em> and the world of opera in a way I found irresistible.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also had some help from Perre diCarlo, who is involved in the film industry.</p>
<p><strong>An early obsession</strong></p>
<p>Taiz takes his <em>Star Trek</em> obsession seriously, but he has a droll wit and a wistful quality that came into play when he looked back on his first exposure to the TV series.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a kid I watched Flash Gordon, with Buster Crabbe as Flash, on our old black- and- white TV,&#8221; Taiz recalled. &#8220;Kirk to me was a more sophisticated, tongue-in-cheek version of Flash. Of course the U.S.S. Enterprise, with its sleek design, huge on-deck viewing screens, and mind-bending warp drive, was a much cooler ship than that old clunker Flash used, which tended to jiggle on its string as it sped toward the planet Mongo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Taiz has devoted much of his life to the sciences, the arts run in his bloodstream. Originally from Philadelphia, his mother, Malvena Taiz, was a modern dancer who studied with Martha Graham. She was a friend of John de Lancie Sr., the principal oboist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and father of the actor John De Lancie Jr.</p>
<p>In fact, De Lancie was the one who first suggested staging a workshop version of the space opera and using audience feedback to help shape the opera into final form, a common practice among directors of stage plays. &#8220;To our infinite delight, he offered to come to Santa Cruz and help us pull it off,&#8221; Taiz said.</p>
<p>While the creative talent and the will to produce a <em>Star Trek&#8211;</em>based opera was in place, the opera team faced a variety of obstacles in their path to the debut performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before the writing began, the first major hurdle was to get permission to proceed with the project from the owner of the copyright, CBS,&#8221; Taiz said. &#8220;This was somewhat nerve-wracking, but in the end we got what we (wanted). CBS signed off on the condition that the opera adaptation was not a money-making venture."</p>
<p>If the creators ever monetize this production, they would need to check in with CBS once more and work out some sort of arrangement.</p>
<p>But so far that has not happened, and the opera-makers are free to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next for the space opera?</strong></p>
<p>So what happens to this ambitious production after the workshop performance this month? Taiz calls this the $64,000 question: &#8220;How do we get the opera produced? It&#8217;s said that that two most expensive things in the world are &#160;war and opera.&#8221;</p>
<p>This being the perception, opera companies tend to play it safe by sticking with the tried and true,&#8221; Taiz said. However, they also realize that opera will fade away without at least some new contemporary works, he added. &#8220;An opera based on <em>Star Trek</em> has the advantage that, as a modern American myth, it comes with a ready-made fan base.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first step is to bring the opera to the attention of various opera companies through personal contacts, both in the U.S. and abroad, and through a video that will be shot of the June 26 performance and made available online.</p>
<p>After that, who knows? For now, composer Ben Carson and his cohorts are squarely in the captain&#8217;s seat at this point, exploring a strange new mash-up of sci-fi and opera, ready to beam it out to the world.</p>

How would you convince your parents, an employer, a politician, or others that there is value in pursuing the humanities?</p>
<p>Those were the questions posed to students across the country by a new contest in response to recent media reports of pessimism about studying the humanities.<br/>
<br/>
 Sponsored by <a href="http://4humanities.org"><strong><em>4Humanities.org</em></strong></a>&#8212;a grass roots organization initiated In the U.S., Canada, and England&#8212;the competition encouraged undergraduates to make the case for the importance of the humanities in any medium or format for a public audience.</p>
<p>The contest was run by Alan Liu, a professor of English at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>"I remember how hard it was for me in the 1970s to tell my engineer dad that I was going to be an English major," said Liu, who came up with the idea for the contest.</p>
<p>"Today after the Great Recession, it's even harder to have such conversations. I hope young people today, no matter what career they want, will be willing to speak up to parents, employers, and politicians about why great societies also need great humanities, and why they personally value the humanities."<br/>
<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz team of The Gail Project took first prize for <a href="https://medium.com/the-gail-project/do-you-have-a-passport-d0915ec58ed2#.rcz4liha3"><strong><em>Do You Have a Passport?</em></strong></a>--an essay/memoir about the project written by team member Stella Fronius.<br/>
<br/>
 <a href="https://gailproject.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>The Gail Project</strong></em></a> is a collaborative, international public history project that explores the founding years of the American military occupation of Okinawa. The project is inspired by a collection of photos taken in Okinawa in 1952 by an American army captain, Charles Eugene Gail. The photos were donated to Special Collections at McHenry Library and made available for student research.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Stella made the case for the importance of the humanities by telling the story of her own path into the Gail Project,&#8221; said history professor Alan Christy, director of the project. &#8220;She won the judges over by describing how the prospect of the work captured her imagination and how her work in the project itself challenged her horizons and her own sense of her abilities.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;During the time Stella worked with me, I've seen her grow tremendously in confidence and capacity,&#8221; Christy added. &#8220;She has managed work teams, planned fundraising, worked on grant applications, and brainstormed the future directions of the project. And, of course, she has done some great research on modern Okinawan history. She has experienced the full range of work that a historian might do and has made the foundation of a bright future for herself.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Fronius, a history student who graduated from UC Santa Cruz with Honors last week, also received the top humanities undergraduate research award at the Humanities Division&#8217;s <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/humanities-awards-celebration.html"><em><strong>2016 Spring Awards Celebration</strong></em></a>. She participated in The Gail Project for two years and was also the Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Intern for the Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The &#8216;Shout Out for the Humanities&#8217; contest was open to students from all over the country and submissions were judged by a very distinguished panel of judges--including presidents of universities, research libraries, and major funding organizations; journalists and researchers in North America and Europe; and important players in media and industry,&#8221; Christy noted. &#8220;To win top prize in a competition of that scale from a panel of judges of such distinction is an enormous accomplishment.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78d4f01e8072701713dacb13c9e26795"><name>goldwater-scholar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergrad wins prestigious Goldwater Scholarship</title><summary>Kfir Dolev, a double major in physics and computer science, was named a 2016 Goldwater Scholar.</summary><start-date>1466578800000</start-date><display-name>Undergrad wins prestigious Goldwater Scholarship</display-name><path>/2016/06/goldwater-scholar</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/goldwater-scholar</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1466611067553</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1466611209199</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/kfir-dolev.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/kfir-dolev.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kfir-dolev.jpg</name><display-name>kfir-dolev.jpg</display-name><file-size>54703</file-size><width>300</width><height>326</height></image><image-alt>Kfir Dolev</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/kfir-dolev-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/kfir-dolev-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kfir-dolev-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kfir-dolev-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18451</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Kfir Dolev</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Kfir Dolev</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kfir Dolev, an undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a 2016 Goldwater Scholar by the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</p>
<p>The Goldwater Scholarship is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The scholarships provide up to $7,500 per year for sophomores and juniors from across the country to cover the costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses.</p>
<p>The foundation awarded 252 scholarships this year, selecting the scholars on the basis of academic merit from a field of 1,150 students nominated by representatives of colleges and universities nationwide.</p>
<p>Dolev, a double major in physics and computer science, will be a senior in the fall. His career goal is to earn a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and conduct research on dark matter phenomenology.</p>
<p>The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986 to honor Senator Barry Goldwater. The scholarship program was designed to foster and encourage outstanding students to pursue careers in the fields of mathematics, the natural sciences, and engineering.

</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Scientists and global leaders are busy seeking solutions to climate change, but a growing number of experts in the field think that another group will have to play a critical role: entrepreneurs. And now is the time for entrepreneurs to enter the fray.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only been in the last five years that we&#8217;ve seen the real impacts of climate change on our livelihood, and that&#8217;s going to cause the right situation for entrepreneurs to play a role in climate change mitigation,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz physics professor and tech entrepreneur Sue Carter.</p>
<p>The impact of climate change couldn&#8217;t be more real to Carter. In 2015, her house burned to the ground in California&#8217;s massive Butte fire, during the worst wildfire year on record in the western U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was so hot that even the wood burning stove was completely melted,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>When climate change is a vague, distant concept, it&#8217;s easy to ignore. When your house burns to the ground, you pay attention. But where others might have just seen tragedy, as both a researcher and entrepreneur, Carter saw opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Climate entrepreneurship gets hot</strong></p>
<p>Multiple factors are coming together at the same time, according to Carter. In addition to the increased visibility of climate change&#8217;s effects, there is a culture shift led by the current generation of students, record-low prices for clean energy that are becoming competitive with fossil fuels, and increasingly favorable policy changes.</p>
<p>Policies have proven to be effective to change behavior, and can provide opportunities for clean tech businesses to gain a competitive advantage. Soliculture, Carter&#8217;s own startup that sells solar greenhouse technology originally developed in her UC Santa Cruz lab, has benefited from the tax rebates available to consumers who invest in solar building projects.</p>
<p>Even the increasing rate of natural disasters has a silver lining for Carter. Disasters can free up money for quick action, sidestep political hurdles, increase a problem's visibility and provide an opportunity to rebuild in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can use the huge influx of cash from natural disasters to cause change to happen on a much faster timescale than is normally possible,&#8221; said Carter. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to rebuild a home with insurance money, you can now build back your home in a completely net-zero way. In fact, you can even generate extra electricity, so it&#8217;s better than net-zero.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Time is of the essence</strong></p>
<p>Time to market is a challenge for all entrepreneurs, doubly so for those in the clean energy and climate change space. Conventional wisdom is that it takes 20 years to advance from invention to market for a brand-new technology, but climate change isn&#8217;t waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;A 20-year delay is equivalent to about a one-degree Celsius rise and a one-meter rise in sea level,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>To Ilan Gur, founding director of Cyclotron Road, an energy technology incubator at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, speed is where research university-based technology incubators can play a critical role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very early-stage tech startups might spend the first few years in research and development. Why not do it within a research university lab environment? The facilities are already there &#8211; it allows you to get started quickly, without wasted money, and to pivot as needed,&#8221; said Gur.</p>
<p>&#8220;For hard tech, physical-science-based startups, the biggest issue right now is that no investors are interested in funding companies at the earliest stage,&#8221; said Gur. &#8220;The timescale is too long and too risky for most investors. But that means it can be nearly impossible for innovators to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyclotron Road is trying to bridge this funding gap, providing early-stage funding for promising energy tech entrepreneurs that get accepted into the incubator, combined with access to the facilities and expertise at Berkeley Lab. The current group of incubating innovators includes Marcus Lehmann, founder of CalWave, a startup with a novel approach to harnessing the power of the ocean to create clean electricity, and the founders of Spark Thermionics, who are developing microfabricated devices that convert wasted heat into electricity.</p>
<p>Thanks to growing entrepreneurship programs within universities and a generation of students that is highly aware of the impact climate change will have on their future, clean tech entrepreneurs are getting an early start.</p>
<p>The effect of these programs has been clear at the University of California. Over the past five years, nearly half of all startups to emerge from UC have been based on student inventions, a rapid acceleration &#8211; and many of these companies are in the clean tech space.</p>
<p><strong>Getting traction</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the problem with new ideas is that they&#8217;re new.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an idea is sufficiently powerful that it matters, it will sound impossible,&#8221; said Gavin McCormick, co-founder and executive director of the clean tech startup WattTime. &#8220;It often comes down to one really well-done proof of concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need a proof of concept to get funding, but you need funding to make a proof of concept. Many great ideas get stuck here, before they can gain momentum.</p>
<p>McCormick was a graduate student at UC Berkeley when he and co-founder Anna Schneider came up with the concept for WattTime, a software tool that allows internet-connected devices to selectively draw power when the local grid has surplus clean power. The idea was exciting, but they needed funding to make it real.</p>
<p>They found an early group of supporters close to home: UC Berkeley undergraduates, who awarded them seed funding from the UC Berkeley Green Initiative Fund, which provides grants to support sustainability projects on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were willing to take the risk,&#8221; said McCormick. &#8220;There&#8217;s a culture of trying at universities, and particularly among students, that can be really supportive of new ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the initial round of funding, WattTime got a further push from the CITRIS Foundry at UC Berkeley, an applied tech incubator that supports early-stage startups and helps them develop and refine prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>Catching the big ideas</strong></p>
<p>University-based incubators can play another key role, according to McCormick: not letting new, potentially world-altering ideas slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>Gur concurs. &#8220;Right now, if there are 20 people graduating with a Ph.D. who could go on to change the world in energy, chances are there are 20 people scratching their heads wondering where to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCormick might never have started WattTime had he not attended a campus hack-athon that opened his eyes to the possibility of founding an organization. It hadn&#8217;t occurred to him as a real prospect before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most researchers aren&#8217;t looking to start a business &#8211; many don&#8217;t even know that they can,&#8221; said McCormick. &#8220;They&#8217;re often not even aware how valuable their ideas are. Someone has to give them that first nudge.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCormick thinks this nudge is essential if we&#8217;re to get the limited funding available to companies that can have the greatest effect on climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all energy technology helps climate change,&#8221; said McCormick. &#8220;There&#8217;s much more acceptance now that things can change, but along with that there&#8217;s also very little vetting of ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crowdfunding, for example, has resulted in both notable successes and failures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enthusiasm is good, but we need better systems for experts to be consulted on business ideas. With the right information, entrepreneurs can both do good and do well.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/phEReDvQToM</url><title>VIDEO:

StoryCruz captures first-person narratives from graduate students describing their research and their hopes</article-subhead><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Graduate student researchers from across the divisions explained their work to a diverse audience during the 12th Annual Graduate Research Symposium at McHenry Library in April. The symposium included graduate student presentations in a variety of formats, including posters, short talks, films, and other media.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/sets/storycruz">StoryCruz</a>, UC Santa Cruz's oral storytelling project, was there to capture the stories of graduate students and their research.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Dan Killam and Carolyn Branecky, both of the Earth and Planetary Science Department, discussed their research and why they were sharing it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I wanted to share with the community what research was going on with my lab group in particular and share some of the research that happens in Antarctica, a place that people don&#8217;t get to visit,&#8221; said Branecky, who presented on a measurement of geothermal heat that a team of researchers collected in Antarctica.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Killam&#8217;s research is with unusual bivalves from the early Jurassic. He hopes to use the past to advocate for conserving unusual organisms that might not get as much attention as others in conservation efforts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jason Ostrove, a linguistics student, presented his research on an indigenous language of Mexico and his work to figure out how to write the language down, since it currently has no writing system.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;There are thousands of speakers of it right here, right now in Santa Cruz County, and there&#8217;s no real way to talk to them because most of them don&#8217;t speak Spanish,&#8221; said Ostrove. &#8220;The places where their language is spoken are mostly in the mountains of Mexico, places the Mexican government hasn&#8217;t tried very hard to access.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Maho Morimoto of the Linguistics Department and Daniel Alves of Computer Engineering spoke of their research on communication.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m generally interested in cross-linguistics phenomena, so borrowings between different languages and between speakers and listeners of different languages,&#8221; said Morimoto. &#8220;And I want to do something that may potentially contribute to the technology advancements these days.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the topic of why they chose to go to graduate school, Alves, who is Brazilian, said, &#8220;I want to have better opportunities of work when I go back home, and also I like research by itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Paulo Quadri of the Environmental Studies Department and Eric Garcia of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program, both of whom are from Mexico, talked of how they appreciated presenting at the symposium because it offered them the chance to see a diversity of work from other departments and field unexpected questions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I like coming here because then you get people from all the departments and you get very different views and sometimes people who have never seen a similar study as yours can ask you the best questions,&#8221; said Garcia. &#8220;The simple questions are the best and are the hardest to answer, as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked what was the most surprising thing he&#8217;d found about UC Santa Cruz, Garcia replied he was amazed at the relaxed atmosphere of his department. &#8220;Very 'Santa Cruzy,'&#8221; he said with a laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I thought you were going to say how good I was at soccer,&#8221; joked Quadri.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Well &#8230; I think we know the answer to that,&#8221; replied Garcia.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was the strength of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s research that lured Quadri, who came from a professional masters at Yale University.</span></p>
<span id="docs-internal-guid-ce288293-8453-ea95-5f7d-2f03a036eb91"><span>&#8220;What surprised me about UC Santa Cruz is how strongly research-oriented it is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here I found really deep research, both applied and basic, that I think contributes a lot to research worldwide. And I&#8217;m really proud of being here because of that.&#8221;</span></span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/graduate-research.html</url><title>Awards recognize top presentations at Graduate Research Symposium</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="84f876de8072701713dacb135225708a"><name>murray-art-journal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Derek Conrad Murray appointed to Art Journal editorial board</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz associate professor Derek Conrad Murray, an interdisciplinary theorist in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department, has been appointed to the Editorial Board of Art Journal.</summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, art journal, derek conrad murray, UCSC history of art and visual culture</keywords><start-date>1466814600000</start-date><display-name>Derek Conrad Murray appointed to Art Journal editorial board</display-name><path>/2016/06/murray-art-journal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/murray-art-journal</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1466814722031</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1467745188517</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/derek-murray-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/derek-murray-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>derek-murray-400.jpg</name><display-name>derek-murray-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>117582</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz associate professor Derek Conrad Murray</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/06/images/derek-murray-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/06/images/derek-murray-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>derek-murray-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>derek-murray-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28924</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz associate professor Derek Conrad Murray</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Derek Conrad Murray</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz associate professor Derek Conrad Murray, an interdisciplinary theorist in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department, has been appointed to the Editorial Board of <em>Art Journal</em>.</p>

<p>Kroeker, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, was chosen for the award by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/index.html">Sustainability Office</a> and the Academic Senate's Committee on Research. She will receive $25,000 to fund the activities outlined in her proposal, as well as $6,000 to host a Carbon Neutrality Fellow, who will work with the Sustainability Office to support faculty and student engagement in climate action.</p>
<p>Kroeker's proposal includes plans to expand her research on the ecological effects of climate change and ocean acidification to include the potential repercussions of these changes on human health. One concern is that increased temperatures and other effects of climate change in estuaries and coastal waters could lead to an increase in the prevalence of waterborne infectious diseases, such as cholera. Kroeker will convene a working group of scientists to study these issues and to look into whether the spread of infectious diseases in coastal waters can be reduced through nature-based strategies, such conservation and restoration of seagrass beds and other marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>"My research is motivated by a desire to improve our ability to forecast and manage the emergent ecological effects of environmental change in coastal ecosystems, as well as to develop actionable solutions," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach to local high schools</strong></p>
<p>A novel outreach program planned in conjunction with this research will target local high school students. Kroeker will train undergraduate and graduate students in climate change communication and outreach, and she will visit high school science classes with her students to give short presentations on climate change, ocean acidification, and human health. They will also produce videos on these issues to be hosted on a Coastal Sustainability Blog and used together with activities for high school students related to climate change action and science careers.</p>
<p>Kroeker said she expects the outreach program and blog to extend beyond the tenure of her one-year award as Climate Action Champion. She also plans to organize a panel discussion on the links between climate change and human health. The panel will include members of the scientific working group and will be open to all students and the public.</p>
<p>In addition, Kroeker will be developing two graduate courses as part of the core curriculum for the proposed Coastal Sustainability Graduate Program. "Facilitating Change" will be a skills-based course in effective leadership and management, focusing on the skills needed for stakeholder engagement, conflict resolution, team building, and project management. "Adaptation and Planning in a Changing Climate" will be a project-based course in which students will work with a local organization, agency, or group to address a real-world problem related to climate change.</p>
<p>Kroeker has been a leader in solutions-based climate change science and planning, working with international organizations such as the World Bank and the Nature Conservancy, briefing Congress on the potential effects of ocean acidification, and engaging in local planning for climate adaptation in the Central California Marine Sanctuaries.</p>

Odigie earned his Ph.D. in environmental toxicology in 2014.</p>
<p>The Kharaka Award is given to scientists from developing countries. Odigie, who is from Nigeria, is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey science center in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"He is a stellar individual, whose research is truly deserving of such recognition," said Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology and Odigie's thesis adviser at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Odigie's Ph.D. dissertation, "Pyrogenic Remobilization of Toxic Metals," used isotopic lead composition to investigate sources of toxic metals from wildfires. His work focused on lead and toxic metal mobility related to wildfires in southern California, central Africa, and South America, and led to several publications, including papers in <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em> and <em>Applied Geochemistry</em>.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the International Association of Geochemistry noted that Odigie's research "illustrates an important application of geochemistry to the solution of the global problem of toxic metals in the environment." The announcement also described Odigie as "a young geochemist from a developing country with a great career ahead of him in trace metal cycles and climate change related issues."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/grad-project-2014-odigie-kingsley.html</url><title>The impact of wildfires</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8aaf80380727017030a023db4ac2be3"><name>message-08</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wrapping up a great year</title><summary>s students take their finals and the campus gets ready for commencement, I want to thank the UC Santa Cruz community for another great year.</summary><start-date>1465369200000</start-date><display-name>Wrapping up a great year</display-name><path>/2016/06/message-08</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/06/message-08</link><created-by>pguther</created-by><created-on>1477345735266</created-on><last-modified-by>pguther</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477589240485</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As students take their finals and the campus gets ready for commencement, I want to thank the UC Santa Cruz community for another great year.</p>
<p>Recent events remind me that we are stronger when we join together.</p>
<p>First, we had a challenging conversation about the future of NCAA Division III athletics, but the outcome is positive. I appreciate student willingness to support the programs, as expressed in the recent <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/athletics-poll.html">opinion poll</a>, and I recognize that students can't bear the entire financial burden. Faculty, alumni, and trustees also stepped forward to join this conversation. Together, we'll figure this out.</p>
<p>Second, I had the pleasure yesterday of presenting a lifetime achievement <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/diversity-awards.html">award for diversity and inclusion</a> to Distinguished Professor of Psychology Faye Crosby. This award is presented annually to an individual who has made an extraordinary contribution to our diversity efforts. Through her scholarship on affirmative action, her mentoring of students, and her community-building as provost of Cowell College, Faye exemplifies the spirit of the award.</p>
<p>Third, as our graduates head out into the world, let's reflect on the quality of education they've received here. Our faculty value teaching, and they bring boundless creativity and care to the task. Computer Engineering Professor Tracy Larrabee, one of this year's recipients of an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/teaching-awards.html">Excellence in Teaching Award</a>, reminds her students that the material is inherently challenging, and failure is part of the learning process&#8212;not a sign of personal deficit.</p>
<p>Great teaching is only part of the equation, of course. Our goal as educators is to instill a lifelong desire to learn, and students ultimately determine whether we're successful.</p>
<p>That's why it's so gratifying to hear about the accomplishments of our alumni, like the computer engineering major who studied Latin and landed a competitive job in Silicon Valley because her employer said "someone who knows Latin can bring something extra." Or the recent graduate who is developing oral vaccines to improve the health of farmed fish--and reduce their environmental impact. Or the psychology graduates whose knowledge of human behavior is shaping the next generation of technology.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is making wonderful contributions to the world.</p>
<p>To our graduates, congratulations and keep in touch. You're leaving the campus but joining a network of more than 100,000 alumni, many of whom are eager to help new graduates. Check out the <a href="http://careers.ucsc.edu/student/networking/career-advice-network.html">Career Advice Network</a>, follow UCSC on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, email your professors and let them know what you're up to. Graduation isn't the end&#8212;it's the beginning of a new phase of your relationship with UC Santa Cruz.</p>
