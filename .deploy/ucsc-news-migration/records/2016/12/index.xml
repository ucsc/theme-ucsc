The number of mosquito species in these areas increased two- to four-fold in the same period.</p>
<p>A new study finds the main drivers of these changes were the gradual waning of DDT concentrations in the environment and increased urbanization. The findings were published December 6 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>The potential effects of climate change on the spread of insect-borne diseases is a major public health concern, but this study found little evidence that mosquito populations in these areas were responding to changes in temperature or precipitation.</p>
<p>"At first glance, recent increases in mosquito populations appear to be linked to rising temperatures from climate change, but careful analyses of data over the past century show that it's actually recovery from the effects of DDT," said corresponding author Marm Kilpatrick, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick explained that the effects of climate change are expected to be seen at the edges of species' geographic ranges, as species adapted to warm climates move further north and cold-adapted species retreat from the southern parts of their ranges. So a tropical species like <em>Aedes aegypti,</em> which transmits Zika, dengue, and other human diseases, could expand its range northward in the United States as temperatures warm.</p>
<p>"On the cold edge of a species' distribution, temperature matters a lot. In Washington D.C., for example, where <em>Aedes aegypti</em> is not common now, it might become more common if the winters get milder. Whereas in Florida, urbanization and mosquito control efforts are more likely to be the dominant drivers of mosquito populations," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>Urbanization is an important factor because it changes the species composition in an area, favoring the types of mosquitoes that live near and feed on people, such as <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, and causing other species to decline, such as those adapted to wetlands and other natural habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Mosquito control</strong></p>
<p>Mosquito control programs continue to help limit mosquito populations in many areas, but currently available techniques are not nearly as effective as DDT was, Kilpatrick said. "Everyone knew DDT was an extremely effective insecticide, but I was surprised by how long-lasting its effects were. In some areas, it took 30 to 40 years for mosquito populations to recover," he said.</p>
<p>More than a billion pounds (600 million kilograms) of DDT were used in the United States from the 1940s through the early 1970s. Its use was curtailed in the 1960s and finally banned in the United States in 1972 because of adverse environmental effects, especially on birds and other wildlife, as well as potential human health risks. Yet DDT was still detectable in soil cores as recently as 2000 in New York state, where DDT use was much higher than in New Jersey and California.</p>
<p>In all three regions, both mosquito abundance and the number of species decreased dramatically during the period of DDT use, then steadily increased as the amount of DDT in the environment declined. In New York, the researchers found, patterns of DDT use and its concentration in the environment could explain most of the long-term trends in mosquito populations. In New Jersey and California, however, the analyses showed that urbanization was also an important factor.</p>
<p>Average annual temperatures showed surprisingly little correlation with mosquito population trends. "Precipitation was more important than temperature, but land use was more important than either of those factors," Kilpatrick said. "The long-term impacts of land use changes on ecosystems are sometimes underappreciated."</p>

<p>This morning, at approximately 12:45 a.m., a female student reported that while she was waiting for a bus at the Kresge College bus stop at the corner of Heller Drive and McLaughlin Drive, she decided to hitchhike a ride from an oncoming vehicle to the base of campus.</p>
<p>The driver, described as a Hispanic male, approximately 24 years old, with short slicked back hair, speaking with a Spanish accent, who also appeared to be intoxicated and smoking marijuana, agreed to provide the ride and began casual conversation. Once they arrived at High and Bay streets, the driver did not stop to allow the student to exit the vehicle and continued down Bay Street toward Mission Street.</p>
<p>The student repeatedly requested that the driver pull over or stop, and he ignored her requests. When approaching Mission Street from Bay Street, and as the vehicle slowed to make a right turn to head northbound on Mission Street, the student exited the vehicle as it was slowly moving. The driver continued driving and fled the area. The student suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>The vehicle was described as newer model 4-door sedan with dark gray or silver paint. It had red paper dealer plates from a Watsonville dealership.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding this investigation is encouraged to immediately call the UCSC Police Department at 831&#8211;459&#8211;2231, ext. 1.</p>

<p>The project, receiving $278,000, was chosen from a pool of more than 100 proposed projects.</p>
<p>Fehren-Schmitz&#8217;s project will have a particular emphasis on graduate student training in this emerging field. By analyzing DNA from ancient humans, pathogens and other genomes, the lab looks to understand how the twin forces of culture and biology have shaped human genomic diversity, demography, and health.</p>
<p>Napolitano launched the President&#8217;s Research Catalyst Awards in 2014 to foster multicampus, interdisciplinary research in areas of strategic importance to California and the world. Since its inception, the program has provided nearly $10 million for research focused on climate change, cultural preservation, drought, basic science and more, and afforded research opportunities for 50 UC faculty, nearly five dozen graduate students and 20 undergraduates.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s awards fund projects aimed at improving teacher training and student outcomes in California&#8217;s K&#8211;12 schools; enhancing knowledge of human health through paleogenomic research; and studying the effects of megafires on ecology and natural food webs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state faces a serious teacher shortage, especially in math, science and other STEM fields,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;This teacher training grant will create a statewide network that aims to put highly qualified teachers in every California classroom, for every subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recipients were selected following a highly competitive review process. A panel of experts evaluated applications based on scholarly merit and likely impact. President Napolitano selected the winners from among the top-ranked proposals representing all areas of university scholarship. The other funded projects are:</p>
<p><strong>California Teacher Education Research and Improvement Network ($1.5M)</strong></p>
<p>Tine Falk Sloan, director of the Teacher Education Program at UC Santa Barbara, will lead a nine-campus research consortium focused on teacher preparation and training. Working with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the California State University System and the California Department of Education, the consortium will research the efficacy of teacher preparation programs; create an infrastructure for statewide data collection; and serve the state through research on policy implementation. It will also develop cross-campus doctoral programs in teacher education scholarship. By helping to develop research-informed policy and training in the K&#8211;12 arena, UC scholarship will also help inform national debates about improving academic outcomes across the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Megafires and Ecological Networks ($271K)</strong></p>
<p>UC Davis conservation biologist Rahel Sollman will lead a project to study the impacts of megafires on the food web network and pollination networks. Better understanding of how megafires affect forest ecology is an increasingly urgent question in California and the western United States. Fire suppression, logging, drought and climate change are all contributing to the severity of fires across the western landscape. Sollman will lead an effort that draws on expertise at UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara and work closely with the U.S. Forest Service to analyze the ecological disruption of megafires and their impact on ecosystem integrity. Funding for the Catalyst Awards comes from the UC president&#8217;s endowment funds, which support systemwide initiatives and projects.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bc8b6dbc8072701752a34ca33fec60c5"><name>uc-principles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC policy on undocumented members of our community</title><summary>Issued yesterday by the UC Office of the President, this statement clearly articulates UC’s commitment to the privacy and civil rights of everyone in our community. </summary><start-date>1480629600000</start-date><display-name>Campus community</display-name><path>/2016/12/uc-principles</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/uc-principles</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1480632002665</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1480632002665</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to share the following UC statement of emphatic support for undocumented members of our community.</p>
<p>Issued yesterday by the UC Office of the President, this statement clearly articulates UC&#8217;s commitment to the privacy and civil rights of everyone in our community. This affirmation of our values, in the wake of divisive presidential campaign rhetoric and uncertainty regarding federal policies under the new administration, makes me proud to be part of this great public university.</p>
<p>These principles reflect input from leaders across the UC system, including myself, and I look forward to continuing to work with partners on this campus and beyond to protect all members of our community. The statement is also <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-releases-principles-support-uc-community-members">available online</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The University of California today (Nov. 30) announced that it will vigorously protect the privacy and civil rights of the undocumented members of the UC community and will direct its police departments not to undertake joint efforts with any government agencies to enforce federal immigration law.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federal administration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during the presidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm that UC will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our community have the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all UC locations,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p>The University issued its Statement of Principles in Support of Undocumented Members of the UC Community after Napolitano met earlier today with UC staff coordinators who support undocumented students at all 10 UC campuses. Napolitano also reviewed the recommendations of a UC task force that she established to study the most effective ways to protect undocumented students and other undocumented members of the UC community.</p>
<p>The principles are to be implemented through policies and procedures at all UC campuses and medical facilities. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University will continue to admit students consistent with its nondiscrimination policies so that undocumented students will be considered for admission under the same criteria as U.S. citizens or permanent residents.</li>
<li>No confidential student records will be released without a judicial warrant, subpoena or court order, unless authorized by the student or required by law.</li>
<li>No UC campus police department will undertake joint efforts with local, state or federal law enforcement agencies to investigate, detain or arrest individuals for violation of federal immigration law.</li>
<li>Campus police officers will not contact, detain, question or arrest any individual solely on the basis of (suspected) undocumented immigration status.</li>
<li>The University will not cooperate with any federal effort to create a registry of individuals based on any protected characteristics such as religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation.</li>
<li>UC medical centers will treat all patients without regard to race, religion, national origin, citizenship or other protected characteristics and will vigorously enforce nondiscrimination and privacy laws and policies.</li>

<p>&#8220;As the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing USDA&#8217;s budget, I&#8217;m really pleased to support this research and help bring this grant home for UCSC,&#8221; said U.S. Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel) about the award. &#8220;Not only is the Central Coast a leading producer of fresh produce for tables across the nation and abroad, we&#8217;re also leaders in agriculture research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to support from the USDA and Rep. Farr, Philpott will be able to help urban farmers and gardeners better understand the relationships between vegetation management, landscape composition, socio-cultural diversity and biodiversity. She will study 25 urban gardens on the California central coast, including spaces in San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Salinas, and Monterey.</p>
<p>Over recent years, American urban areas have experienced a boost in small scale, local food production. Urban farms and gardens have provided residents&#8212;especially those living in underserved communities&#8212;with the fresh produce and nutrition lacking in these areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many urban gardeners lack regionally appropriate agricultural knowledge regarding pest control, pollination, water storage, and garden sustainability,&#8221; says Philpott. She has been studying insect biodiversity in urban gardens to better understand the ecological roles that natural enemies of pests and pollinators provide in these green spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;This missing knowledge is especially concerning given increasing food demands, increased climate-induced ecosystem stress, and the increasing importance of urban agriculture for providing for food security, especially in communities where food access is quite limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Philpott points out, ecosystem services like pest control and pollination are a necessary function of biodiversity and a critical factor to a successful crop yield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the known importance of ecosystem services for crop yields in urban farms, there is a gap in our understanding of ecosystem services for urban agriculture,&#8221; Philpott says.</p>
<p>Philpott and her research team will look at what production practices are essential to promoting pest control, pollination, and water conservation in urban gardens&#8212;essential to providing food for urban gardeners.</p>
<p>Throughout his tenure in political office, Rep. Farr has advocated for organic agriculture for California and the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;During my 40-plus years in elected office, I&#8217;ve been a champion for increasing access to fresh fruits and vegetables and for improving sustainable agriculture practices,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Rep. Farr has also been a strong supporter of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UCSC&#8217;s farm and garden program. In 2012 he presented a $665,000 USDA grant to the school for its organic farming training program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=70203&amp;format=WEBLINK</url><title>Grant announcement from USDA</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://farr.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1276-farr-announces-440-000-grant-for-ucsc</url><title>Statement from Rep.

This year the campus will be closed from Friday, December 23, 2016 through Monday, January 2, 2017, re-opening on Tuesday, January 3, 2017. The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers, and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p>
<p>During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.</p>
<p>If you are required to work all or part of this closure, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:jcmisuna@ucsc.edu">jcmisuna@ucsc.edu</a>, by campus mail to Jill Misunas, Physical Plant at Barn G, or by fax (9-5121) no later than Wednesday, December 14, 2016, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time.

(Photo by Getty Images)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UC Santa Cruz, is the winner of a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for revealing how the complex molecular machines called ribosomes translate genetic code and build the proteins in all living cells.</p>
<p>The award will be presented Sunday evening, December 4, at a star-studded ceremony at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. The ceremony, to be broadcast live at 7 p.m. Pacific Time on the National Geographic Channel, will be hosted by Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman. The Breakthrough Prizes were founded in 2013 by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Sergey Brin and Anne Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, and Yuri and Julia Milner.</p>
<p>"Harry Noller has performed a tour de force in molecular biology for the past 50 years," said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. "This recognition is well-deserved."</p>
<p><strong>Practical applications</strong></p>
<p>Noller's research group was the first to solve the complete structure of a ribosome, publishing landmark papers in 1999 and 2001. More recent work in his lab has shown how the ribosome actually works to carry out protein synthesis. This research has practical applications because many antibiotics work by blocking the activity of bacterial ribosomes. Understanding the structure of the ribosome has enabled the development of novel antibiotics that hold promise for use against germs that have developed resistance to current drugs.</p>
<p>Noller's discoveries also shed light on fundamental questions about the origins of life. Ribosomes are ancient structures that provide the link between the genetic instructions encoded in DNA and RNA molecules and the proteins that carry out most of the activities of living cells.</p>
<p>Each ribosome is composed of both proteins and RNA molecules interlaced together. When Noller first proposed in the 1970s that the RNA component performs the ribosome's key functions, the idea met stiff resistance because only proteins were thought capable of catalyzing biochemical reactions. But he turned out to be right.</p>
<p><strong>Paradigm shift</strong></p>
<p>"This was a huge paradigm shift. It turned our understanding of molecular biology upside down," said Noller, a professor emeritus of molecular, cell and developmental biology. "Many people in molecular biology now believe that life originated in an RNA world. In other words, RNA was doing everything, before proteins and even DNA came along."</p>
<p>The Breakthrough Prize recognizes Noller "for discovering the centrality of RNA in forming the active centers of the ribosome, the fundamental machinery of protein synthesis in all cells, thereby connecting modern biology to the origin of life and also explaining how many natural antibiotics disrupt protein synthesis."</p>
<p>The Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences are funded by a grant from Sergey Brin and Anne Wojcicki's foundation, The Brin Wojcicki Foundation; a grant from Mark Zuckerberg's fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation; a grant from Jack Ma's Foundation; and a grant from the Milner Foundation.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>For Bronwen Stanford, the scholarship she received from the Northern California Association of Phi Beta Kappa has been a crucial element in supporting her work in studying stream restoration as she pursues a Ph.D. in Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely been helpful,&#8221; Stanford said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hugely important to get funding for all these research expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally from Washington, Stanford earned an undergraduate degree at Stanford University, studying human biology with an emphasis on conservation and development.</p>
<p>Having performed well in a variety of academic areas during her undergraduate program, Stanford was offered membership into the <a href="https://www.pbk.org/web/">Phi Beta Kappa Society</a>, the oldest and&#8212;some would argue&#8212;the most prestigious honor society in the United States of America.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard of it until I was nominated,&#8221; Stanford said. &#8220;But they looked at my academic record and I was accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz chapter of&#160;Phi Beta Kappa&#160;has now been in existence for 30 years will celebrate its anniversary from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Friday at the Merrill Provost House. Members of the campus community <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdALIWcUqsJWhqGiW4hdXtPp80N2lFkuJ8RkeWLUDyHDzYV1Q/viewform">are invited and are asked to RSVP&#160;online</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for students to remain unaware of Phi Beta Kappa until they are offered induction into its sacrosanct ranks, said William Ladusaw, a professor of linguistics, who also serves as the Phi Beta Kappa historian for UCSC.</p>
<p>While the honor society may not have a wide public profile, those initiated into its ranks understand acceptance means academic excellence in the arts and sciences at the collegiate and university level.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was created to encourage the values of a liberal education, excellence in intellectual accomplishment and a life-long love of learning,&#8221; Ladusaw said. &#8220;At least for most of the life of the republic it has been a noticeable honor, one puts it on the vita as a sign of accomplishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The society notes that 17 U.S. Presidents, 28 U.S. Supreme Court Justices and 136 Nobel Laureates are members of Phi Beta Kappa. Ralph Waldo Emerson, T.S. Elliott, Henry Kissinger, Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, W.E.B. Du Bois, President George H.W. Bush, Francis Ford Coppola, Pearl Buck, and President Bill Clinton are just a few of the notable members.</p>
<p>The honor society, which was the first fraternity to use combinations of the Greek alphabet as its name, was founded in 1776 in the Apollo Room of the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg, by students at William and Mary College. The honor society, which was secret at the time, soon spread to the Ivy League, adopted by Yale and Harvard.</p>
<p>It grew rapidly from there, but Phi Beta Kappa does not open a chapter on every college campus. Instead, it employs a degree of selectivity, choosing to open chapters only at higher learning institutions that embody its values of intellectual breadth as well as accomplishment.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s founding of its chapter in 1986 was not without difficulty.</p>
<p>When Ladusaw arrived at the UCSC campus in 1984 as a junior faculty member in the Humanities Division, a group of senior professors were mounting a campaign to bring the honor society to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>While UCSC&#8217;s interdisciplinary approach to the academy and its insistence that its students incorporate breadth as well as depth into their liberal arts harmonized with the values of Phi Beta Kappa there was one sticking point &#8212; UCSC didn&#8217;t give out grades.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until 2000 that UCSC moved away from its traditional alternative to the grade point average system, as prior to that professors would give narrative evaluations of their students&#8217; performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The society was skeptical that we could prove our students were excelling to a level of satisfaction nationally,&#8221; Ladusaw said.</p>
<p>But a group of UCSC senior faculty led by Don Osterbrock, a distinguished astronomy professor and Brewster Smith, a distinguished professor in psychology, persisted in their efforts to make a case to Phi Beta Kappa, eventually prevailing upon them to include UCSC.</p>
<p>Currently about 10 percent of the higher learning institutions in the United States feature a chapter. There are 286 of them. Of the Phi Beta Kappa chapters, only about 10 percent of the student body is offered and awarded memberships into the society.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of high GPA students who are not in the society because they take a minimalist path toward graduation,&#8221; Ladusaw said. &#8220;The values of the society assert the point of education is not just workforce preparation, but life-long learning and achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Stanford, these values are part of the appeal and honor of membership.</p>
<p>&#8220;They clearly believe the purpose of education is making better world citizens,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Throughout my undergrad I had been taking classes across a lot of different departments because that was what interested me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool that type of broad interest is something they value.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d17c6b7d8072701752a34ca37cc95ece"><name>water-main-flushing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Flushing of campus water mains begins Wednesday, Dec. 14</title><summary>Beginning Wednesday, Dec. 14 and continuing through Thursday, Dec. 22, Physical Plant crews will conduct a campus water-main-flushing program.</summary><start-date>1480982400000</start-date><display-name>Water main flushing </display-name><path>/2016/12/water-main-flushing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/water-main-flushing</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1480983340637</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481042577898</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="article-body">
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Physical Plant is responsible for maintenance of all water mains on campus. Beginning Wednesday, Dec. 14 and continuing through Thursday, Dec. 22, Physical Plant crews will conduct a campus water-main-flushing program.</p>
The annual water-main-flushing program is a vital part of maintaining water quality standards mandated by the state of California. Water main flushing also assures availability of water at appropriate pressures in the event of emergencies.<br/>
<p>Flushing requires a high flow of water for short periods of time and is done at key fire hydrant locations around campus. Campus crews make an effort to minimize the impact to roads and landscape during the brief, high-flow periods and ask for patience and understanding while the process is underway.</p>
<p>The health and welfare of all on campus is in the mission statement of the Physical Plant and hydrant flushing is part of that mission. Physical Plant thanks you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Sara Hoda, who graduated from Merrill College in 2009, died in the fire, as did Cash Askew, a Kresge College student who attended from 2012-14.</p>
<p>Sara, 30, graduated with dean's honors and taught at a Montessori school in Oakland, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Cash, who grew up in San Francisco, was working toward a degree in art at UC Santa Cruz and remained connected to the university after she left campus</p>
<p>The scope of this tragedy is difficult to fathom. Authorities continue to say they expect to recover additional victims, which means it is possible Sara and Cash may not be the only campus affiliates who lost their lives. What is certain is that our community has been touched by this tragedy. Please join us in extending support to friends and colleagues who may need comfort today and in coming days.</p>

Researchers from UC Santa Cruz analyzed infection data and population trends of the little brown bat in the eastern United States and found that populations in New York that had stabilized after initial declines had much lower infection levels at the end of winter than populations that were still declining.</p>
<p>The little brown bat was previously one of the most abundant bat species in the eastern United States, but was reduced to less than 10 percent of its former population with the arrival of white-nose syndrome. The fungus was introduced to New York State in 2006, and it continues to spread in the United States and Canada, causing declines of 90 percent or more in several species.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz researchers led by biologists Marm Kilpatrick and Winifred Frick have been at the forefront of research on the disease, conducting field surveys to help track its spread and studying the dynamics of disease transmission and the impacts on bat populations.</p>
<p>In the new study, researchers sampled hibernating bats at nine sites in New York, Illinois, and Virginia, using a standardized sampling technique to detect and quantify the amount of fungus on each bat. They then used mathematical modeling techniques to examine differences in disease dynamics between persisting and declining populations. Their findings were published December 5 in the journal <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1712/20160044"><em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Populations of little brown bats have declined dramatically across their range. There have been several reports that populations in New York, where the disease was first introduced, are no longer declining, but no one understood why,&#8221; said first author Kate Langwig, who worked on the study as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is now at Harvard University. &#8220;This study is the first to indicate that little brown bats appear to have evolved resistance to the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers considered several possible hypotheses for the ability of some bats to persist with the fungus: host resistance, host tolerance, and lower transmission. Their results pointed toward host resistance causing lower growth rates of the fungus during late winter. The results did not support the other hypotheses, Langwig said.</p>
<p>The mechanism underlying the resistance of little brown bats remains unknown. &#8220;It could be changes in arousal behavior, differences in skin microbes, or an activation of the immune response by bats after infection has reached a moderate level. Future studies are needed to uncover these details,&#8221; Langwig said.</p>
<p>The authors emphasized that they have only examined populations of a single bat species. &#8220;For other species, like the northern long-eared bat, we don&#8217;t have evidence to suggest populations are persisting inside hibernacula,&#8221; Langwig said. &#8220;While this study is good news for some colonies of little brown bats, other species show little sign of being able to persist with the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Langwig, the coauthors of the paper include Winifred Frick and Marm Kilpatrick, both faculty members in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UC Santa Cruz; Joseph Hoyt, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz; and Katy Parise and Jeffrey Foster at the University of New Hampshire.

<p>Of the more than 722 entering students who completed math placement via online assessment during the summer of 2015 and made use of adaptive learning software to review and reassess, 84 percent showed marked improvement that enabled them to qualify for higher math courses. Many students who had placed into College Algebra (Math 2), for example, were placed into Pre-Calculus (Math 3) or Calculus after working through online adaptive instruction. Others who had initially placed into more advanced courses than College Algebra also improved their placement, enabling them to make more rapid progress toward their academic goals. All of this was accomplished without worsening overall pass rates in these courses.</p>
<p>Last summer, even more UC Santa Cruz students improved their math placement: 88 percent of the 731 students who reviewed and reassessed qualified for more advanced math courses.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s new placement process uses McGraw-Hill&#8217;s Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) math placement system. This artificially intelligent assessment and learning system addresses college preparedness, course performance, and retention with its Placement, Preparation, and Learning (ALEKS PPL) platform. Using adaptive technology, ALEKS provides personalized learning in basic math through calculus to help students qualify to take more advanced courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;When students arrive on campus better prepared in math, they have a better chance of making good progress toward their degree and graduating on time,&#8221; says Jaye Padgett, Interim Vice Provost for <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu">Student Success</a>.</p>
<p>How does ALEKS PPL work? ALEKS is an interactive, web-based system that uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately estimate the student&#8217;s mathematical knowledge. ALEKS then offers instruction on the topics the student is most ready to learn; as the student progresses, ALEKS makes periodic reassessments to ensure the material is mastered and retained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine the student&#8217;s knowledge space as a jigsaw puzzle, in which each of the 314 pieces represents a specific math skill or concept,&#8221; said UCSC mathematics Professor Debra Lewis. &#8220;The complete picture contains 11 interconnected images corresponding to key areas of mathematics. In Placement mode, ALEKS assembles the parts of the puzzle modeling the student&#8217;s current understanding. In Preparation and Learning mode, ALEKS helps the student complete their puzzle, offering material that interlocks with the skills and knowledge already in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>ALEKS was developed at UC Irvine in 1994 with support from a National Science Foundation grant, and in 2007, ALEKS Corporation was approached by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which had concerns about its students entering Calculus I without prerequisite skills. The mathematics department piloted the ALEKS Prep for Calculus for course placement and found a relationship between the scores on the ALEKS assessments and course outcomes.</p>
<p>For now, the goal is to use ALEKS PPL to reduce the number of students needing College Algebra and Pre-calculus without jeopardizing those students&#8217; success in math, to expedite the time it takes students to graduate, and to improve retention and graduation rates, particularly for those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e4a498218072701752a34ca3d158d49f"><name>alexa-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz team chosen to compete in Amazon's Alexa Prize Challenge</title><summary>UCSC computer scientists have won a sponsorship from Amazon to develop a "socialbot" that can converse with humans. </summary><keywords>Marilyn Walker, Amazon Alexa, Alexa Prize, socialbot, natural language, dialogue management, Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab</keywords><start-date>1481270400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC team chosen to compete in Amazon's Alexa Prize Challenge</display-name><path>/2016/12/alexa-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/alexa-prize</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1481304740554</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481306847880</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/slugbot-team-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/slugbot-team-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slugbot-team-425.jpg</name><display-name>slugbot-team-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>109534</file-size><width>425</width><height>319</height></image><image-alt>SlugBots team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/echo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/echo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>echo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>echo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16702</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>echo photo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The UC Santa Cruz SlugBots team: Jiaqi Wu, Kevin Bowden, Amita Misra, Marilyn Walker, and Shereen Oraby.

<p>The UCSC team, called SlugBots, is one of 12 university teams sponsored by Amazon to try to develop a "socialbot" that can converse coherently with humans using Alexa, the voice-controlled digital assistant in Amazon's Echo and other devices. Amazon is giving each of the 12 teams, selected from more than 100 applicants, a $100,000 stipend, Alexa-enabled devices, free access to Amazon Web Services, and support from the Alexa team.</p>
<p>The team with the highest-performing socialbot will win a $500,000 prize. An additional prize of $1 million will be awarded to the winning team's university if their socialbot achieves the grand challenge of conversing coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>"Dialogue interaction has always been the core interest of my lab, so this challenge fits well with the research projects my students are working on," said Walker, who heads the <a href="https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/">Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab</a> in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Conversational AI</strong></p>
<p>The SlugBots team consists of four computer science graduate students in her lab: Kevin Bowden, Shereen Oraby, Amita Misra, and Jiaqi Wu. Bowden, the team lead, was already working on a socialbot project, although with a narrower focus than the Alexa Prize competition. The SlugBots approach builds on this and other ongoing work in Walker's lab on various aspects of what is sometimes called "conversational artificial intelligence."</p>
<p>For a digital agent to carry on a conversation, it has to be able to make sense of what is said to it; find relevant information and, based on the context, find potential content for a response; then choose appropriate content for the response from a range of possibilities; and finally construct a coherent and grammatical spoken response.</p>
<p>"Those are the high level tasks, and each one is a big research problem on its own," Oraby said. "And then you want it to be unpredictable and engaging, so it doesn't seem to be mechanically plugging information into slots."</p>
<p>In addition to Amazon's Alexa, the digital assistants now on the market include Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and a growing number of others. But none of them can really carry on a conversation.</p>
<p>"Research on conversational agents is exploding right now, and there are tons of people working on the problem," Walker said. "That's a good thing, because there is a lot of room for improvement. I expect our work here at UCSC on expressive language generation, understanding informal language, and statistical approaches to dialogue management to be key to making SlugBots competitive. I am so proud of my team for being selected out of over 100 teams that applied."</p>
<p>Much of the work in Walker's lab is data driven and involves mining social media to compile a large database of examples of social language and casual dialogue, and then analyzing and annotating them so they can be used to train computer algorithms using machine learning techniques.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Sarcasm and humor</strong></p>
<p>Things like sarcasm and humor are especially challenging for a computer algorithm to identify or to use. Oraby's thesis research has focused on identifying and classifying different styles of expressing sarcasm, and developing algorithms both to detect it in the user and to use it in a response. "It can give the socialbot personality, but it's important to know when it's appropriate," she said.</p>
<p>Wu is tackling another aspect of natural speech that digital agents have trouble with: emotional content, or how a person feels about a situation or event. Simply identifying whether something is good or bad is difficult unless the speaker uses words with clear positive or negative connotations. "For example, if you tell Siri you broke your leg, it doesn't respond appropriately," Wu said.</p>
<p>Misra's research focuses on argumentative dialogue and involves analyzing debates on social media. "We have these huge dumps of data from social media sites, and we want to develop an algorithm that can extract the arguments used by different sides in debates on key topics like gun control or the death penalty," she explained. "Alexa could then analyze what the user is saying, identify their position, and present different arguments."</p>
<p>"We're interested in features we can use to give personality to the socialbot to make the conversation more engaging," said Bowden, whose research includes work on an algorithm to generate dialogue from a narrative, with variations that alter the personality represented by each speaker.</p>
<p>The teams will get feedback from Alexa users to help them improve their algorithms. Beginning in April 2017, as part of the research and judging process, Alexa customers will be able to converse with a socialbot about a current topic of interest to them, such as sports, politics, celebrity gossip, or scientific breakthroughs. The feedback from Alexa users will be a factor in selecting the best socialbots to advance to the final round of the competition. Winners will be announced in November 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/09/marilyn-walker.html</url><title>Teaching computers the nuances of human conversation</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/n0XYVVDNbeo?t=17m45s</url><title>Video: Can we teach computers to say what we feel?</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/y-oar0WBcew</url><title>Video: "Hey Siri, Let's Talk"</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e5062bd98072701752a34ca3c14bf633"><name>in-memoriam-renee-ropp</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam - Renee Ropp</title><summary>&#13;

Please note that the S&amp;E Library building will be open, and library services available, during the project. The only exception is December 12-22, 2016 when the building will be closed for demolition in project space. During this brief closure, collection material located at S&amp;E will be available during the closure by emailing, <a href="mailto:circulation@ucsc.edu">circulation@ucsc.edu</a>, or calling the McHenry Library service desk at 9-5185. Campus planners scheduled the most disruptive construction activity during the break between academic quarters in an effort to mitigate the impact on faculty, students, and staff who use the S&amp;E Library. ALC construction is scheduled to conclude in September 22, 2017.</p>
<p>The University Library and Division of Physical and Biological Sciences are excited to be launching this project to create the first classroom of its kind at UC Santa Cruz. The ALC will accommodate up to 99 people in an open floor plan with flexible furnishings and technology systems to facilitate active inquiry-based student-group-instructor interactions. Library patrons will be able to access the ALC when not in use by PBSci for classes. The target for ALC operation is Fall Quarter 2017.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Office of Research has started a new quarterly program to acknowledge researchers for their U.S. patent awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Groundbreaking research is conducted on campus every day,&#8221; said Mohamed Abousalem, who recently stepped into a newly created position&#8212;assistant vice chancellor for the Office of Research&#8217;s Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization (IATC).</p>
<p>With more than 25 years of&#160;technical and business management experience, Abousalem was most recently founding CEO of TECTERRA Inc., a not-for-profit organization helping Canadian startup and small companies develop and commercialize innovative technologies. He is now leading UCSC efforts to bolster patent activities and services for technology transfer and help faculty, students and staff commercialize inventions and discoveries.</p>
<p>It is not a new focus for the office, but one that puts a greater emphasis on customer service and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>&#8220;The effort reflects a broader UC strategy to foster innovation and entrepreneurship,&#8221; Abousalem said. &#8220;We want to acknowledge the hard work and the success that is here and let employees know we are open for business to help them realize the value of their inventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>This quarter, the office recognized six researchers whose work resulted in the recent award of four diverse patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patents include a new method for genome assembly that is already being used in a commercial venture, an appetite-stimulating protein for people suffering from loss of hunger, a method to help screen for bacteria in worms that cause tropical diseases and the discovery of new methods for improving certain antibiotic function. These patents grew out of the 40&#8211;50 disclosures fielded by the IATC unit annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to increase the number of annual disclosures to 100 in the near future,&#8221; Abousalem says.</p>
<p>Top on his agenda is improving services for university employees who are mandated by contract to file disclosures on all their inventions, both on campus and off campus regardless of whether it is work-related. Generally, about a third of the disclosures are pursued for patent prosecution. UC bears all expenses related to the prosecution of these patents and the recruitment of licensees.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a little bit of encouragement, I wound up launching a startup company,&#8221; said Ed Green, a genome scientist in the Biomolecular Engineering Department who developed a faster method to assemble genomes in vitro. Green, who filed a preliminary disclosure with the then Office of Management of Intellectual Property in 2013, saw his patent approved in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a complete novice to the intellectual properties aspect,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;They held my hand and set me up with a lawyer to get the patent process off the ground. They were very encouraging about getting a startup going.&#8221;</p>
<p>His company, Dovetail Genomics, which opened its doors in summer 2013 in a bio-incubator space on campus, now employs about 20 people in its own office in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re putting together a lot of genomes of plants and animals,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing exceptionally well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also recognized this quarter were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Glenn Millhauser, a professor in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry who discovered an appetite stimulating protein that can help people suffering from the side affects of certain treatments such as chemotherapy;</li>
<li>William Sullivan, professor of Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology, who&#8212;with Catharina Casper-Lindley, a senior scientist in the Sullivan Lab, and Pamela White, a graduate student in the Sullivan Lab&#8212;discovered a way to screen for bacteria in worms that are responsible for several life-threatening diseases in third world countries; and</li>
<li>Joseph Konopelski, professor of chemistry, whose identification of new ways to build compounds in certain antibiotics could be of use to the drug development community.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Office of Research aims to be customer-focused, connecting the university community with the right industry contacts and potential partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will help you build your intellectual property portfolio and realize its value through market deployment for economic and societal returns.,&#8221; Abousalem says. UCSC already has a formidable presence in several areas. &#8220;We want to grow it and expand it into other areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abousalem also hopes to encourage young professors and inventors who haven&#8217;t yet thought of pursuing a patent to engage with the IATC office to start building their IP portfolio.</p>
<p>In the spring, several new initiatives from the UC Office of the President will be rolled out across the 10 campuses to further innovation, commercialization, and entrepreneurship and highlight the growing body of research providing public benefit. The IATC office will lead the implementation of these initiatives with various leaders around campus to bring these opportunities to the entire university community.</p>

<h3>Faster, Better Genome Assembly</h3>
<p><em>Edward Green<br/>
</em> Assembling genomes is like solving a giant, 3 billion-piece jigsaw puzzle. The invention describes a streamlined way to figure out which pieces are near other pieces so the puzzle can be reconstructed more accurately and quickly. Licensed by Dovetail Genomics in Santa Cruz, the invention has been used to assemble the genomes of hundreds of plant and animals. With this information, scientists can begin to unravel the biology inherent in each.</p>
<h3>A New Route To&#160;B-Lactam Structures</h3>
<p><em>Joe Konopelski&#160;</em><br/>
 Suitably constructed, the&#160;b-lactam ring, represents the core of a vast array of antibiotics, including some used to treat drug-resistant bacterial strains. During the course of another project we discovered a new route to&#160;b-lactam structures from readily available starting materials. Our discovery could be of use to the drug development community, particularly as antibiotic resistance is such an important problem.</p>
<h3>The Appetite Stimulating Protein</h3>
<p><em>Glenn Millhauser</em><br/>
 A primary area of our research deals with metabolic signaling in the brain, with specific attention to the Agouti-Related Protein. AgRP is a small, hormone-like protein that plays a critical role in the neuronal pathways that give the sensation of hunger and controls how our bodies store energy. In 2002, our lab used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to solve the AgRP structure. Since then, we&#8217;ve been trying to understand the functional importance of the protein&#8217;s domains.</p>
<p>We are also very interested in the protein&#8217;s therapeutic potential. Understandably, most of the modern focus on controlling metabolic function deals with weight loss. However, there are very important clinical scenarios where weight gain is essential. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and AIDS sufferers often develop a life threatening condition called cachexia (similar to anorexia). These patients not only lose the desire to eat, but their bodies also experience extreme atrophy with profound loss of muscle tissue. With cachexia brought on by chemotherapy it&#8217;s the classic case of the treatment being worse than the disease. There are few drugs for treating cachexia; once the condition sets in, it is very difficult to reverse. Fortunately as demonstrated in animal models, AgRP is uniquely capable of reversing cachexia with restoration of appetite and subsequent weight gain.</p>
<p>Building on our interest in AgRP functional domains, and motivated by the need for clinical treatments, we developed a new strategy for enhancing AgRP function through mutagenesis. Our most potent proteins stimulate feeding at more than double that of wild-type AgRP. This protein and its variants could prove to be remarkably useful as drugs for enhancing the outcome of cancer and AIDS treatments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

northern Alaska, to the Japanese American Museum in San Jose and the Santa Cruz County jail, humanities Ph.D. students expanded their horizons this year thanks to a new program started by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute for Humanities Research</strong></em></a> (IHR).<br/>
 <br/>
 The new IHR Public Fellows program provides an opportunity for humanities doctoral students to participate in research, programming, communications, and fundraising at a wide variety of non-profit organizations, cultural institutions, and companies.<br/>
 <br/>
 The aim of the fellowships is to enable these students to apply and expand their skills in a non-academic setting while engaged in graduate study.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Humanities Ph.D. programs have been set up to prepare students primarily for tenure-track positions at colleges and universities,&#8221; noted IHR Managing Director Irena Poli&#263;. &#8220;Increasingly, our students are pursuing careers in different professions, inside and outside academia, and we wanted to create a program that would allow them to work in different environments.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Most of our public fellows credit this program with allowing them to imagine themselves doing humanities in the public sphere, re-imagining what it means to be a humanities scholar in the world,&#8221; Poli&#263; added.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Vivian Underhill</strong> worked for the Northern Alaska Environmental Center (NAEC), a small, grassroots environmental nonprofit in Fairbanks, Alaska, that focuses on economic and climate justice in central and northern Alaska.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;My role focused on the NAEC&#8217;s campaign against oil and gas production in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, acting as a liaison between the NAEC and its coalition partners,&#8221; said Underhill. &#8220;We conducted interviews with activists along the North Slope and federal Bureau of Land Management officials, and drafted policy and position statements, advocacy and educational material, plus a successful grant application.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Katie Trostel</strong> spent her summer in Oslo, Norway, at a museum and research institution called The Center for the Study of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Under the supervision of Anton Weiss-Wendt, head of research, I gained experience in academic publishing--assisting in compiling a two-volume collection of documents scheduled for publication in 2018 titled <em>Documents on the Genocide Convention from the American, British, and Russian Archives</em>,&#8221; said Trostel.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;In addition to copy-editing translations of Russian documents, I transcribed handwritten correspondence from the Cold War period written by British colonial officials,&#8221; Trostel added. &#8220;I was also credited with copy-editing text for a temporary exhibition on the history of the Gulag, <em>The Gulag: What Grandfather Didn&#8217;t Tell</em>, at the Norwegian Holocaust Center in Oslo.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Trostel noted that the building where she worked was itself a site of memory, adding that Vidkun Quisling, head of the Norwegian collaborationist government, lived in the space during the Nazi occupation of Oslo. It was later transformed into a place dedicated to educating the public about collective memory and genocide studies.<br/>
 <br/>
 At the Santa Cruz County Jail, <strong>David Donley</strong>, a teaching assistant in the Philosophy Department, worked as an instructor for an anti-recidivism program called CODE 4.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;As part of a comprehensive curriculum to develop healthy habits of mind, I taught a critical thinking course with a special focus on ethics,&#8221; said Donley. &#8220;The primary goal was to promote open-minded, logical argumentation and empathetic, respectful dialogue about contemporary ethical dilemmas.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Donley noted that the topics discussed on a weekly basis ranged from criminal justice issues to the legalization of physician-assisted suicide.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Claire Ubranski</strong> spent her summer working at The Arizona State Museum (ASM), one of the nation&#8217;s largest state-operated archaeological repositories for excavated objects, artifacts, and human remains. The repository handles Native American Graves and Repatriation Act claims and protocol.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Many archeological digs conducted in Arizona entailed the excavation of Indigenous burial sites,&#8221; said Urbanski. &#8220;The ASM spends a great deal of time going through past dig project materials. I spent most of my time cataloguing and screening archeological and archival materials for funerary objects and human remains so that they could be repatriated to their descendants or affiliated communities.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Sarah Papazoglakis</strong> worked in the office of California Humanities, an independent non-profit partner of the National Endowment for the Humanities, that was founded in 1975 as a granting organization.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I researched the organization&#8217;s internal and external 40-year history, conducted interviews with more than 15 project directors who worked with California Humanities from 1975-2015, and produced 15 brief feature stories that tell the history of California Humanities through the programs they&#8217;ve produced and/or sponsored," noted Papazoglakis.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Kara Hisatake</strong> spent time at the Japanese American Museum of San Jose on grant writing and docent work this past summer. &#8220;As a docent, I was able to share history and culture in an accessible way to the public, a very different experience from a conference presentation or teaching specific reading materials,&#8221; Hisatake observed. &#8220;Both of these experiences have opened up new ways for what I do as a graduate student in academia to directly connect with larger communities.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 And closer to home, public fellows <strong>Taylor Wondergem</strong> and <strong>Ashley Herum</strong> spent their summers working in the local community. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Wondergem spent her time with Dr. Kristin Wilson of Cabrillo College, developing a program with a working title of "Gender Across the Curriculum."<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Gender Across the Curriculum is envisioned as a model program which introduces gender as an analytic into science course work,&#8221; Wondergem noted. She additionally helped write a grant proposal which will be submitted to the National Endowment for the Humanities in Fall 2017.<br/>
 <br/>
 While across town, Herum worked in downtown Santa Cruz as the assistant dramaturg for Santa Cruz Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>A Midsummer Nights Dream</em>.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I had the privilege of working under the tutelage of Michael Warren, professor emeritus of literature at UCSC,&#8221; said Herum. &#8220;It was a joy to learn from him about the staging practices of Elizabethan/Jacobean England, while attending virtually all rehearsals of the play.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I was also given the opportunity to contribute material I had written on <em>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</em> to the study guide for &#8216;Weekend with Shakespeare,&#8221; an annual series of workshops and lectures sponsored jointly by Santa Cruz Shakespeare and UCSC&#8217;s Shakespeare Workshop,&#8221; she added.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f53a61ca8072701752a34ca3ae0378ff"><name>boat-parade</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Community Sailing Club takes best in show for third straight year</title><start-date>1481581800000</start-date><display-name>Lighted Boat Parade</display-name><path>/2016/12/boat-parade</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/boat-parade</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1481582992513</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481593094119</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/Argo1.png</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/Argo1.png</link><site>news</site><name>Argo1.png</name><display-name>Argo1.png</display-name><file-size>987732</file-size><width>640</width><height>1136</height></image><image-alt>lighted sailboat</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The UC Santa Cruz Community Sailing Club transformed its 32-foot sailboat into a mythical Greek sailing vessel, winning Best in Show in the 2016 Lighted Boat Parade.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The UC Santa Cruz Community Sailing Club captured Best in Show at the Santa Cruz Lighted Boat Parade Dec. 3. <br/>
<br/>
The parade has been a regular event at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor for decades.&#160; UCSC has won best in show for the third consecutive year. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
Club members transformed their 32-foot sailboat into a Greek sailing vessel, the Argo.&#160; After watching the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts, they were inspired by Jason&#8217;s quest to find the magical Golden Fleece and save his kingdom.&#160; Aided by gods Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon, and after battling monsters and harsh seas, their quest was fulfilled and peace once again descended upon the kingdom as they battled to protect the citizens of Santa Cruz from monsters beyond the harbor entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Club membership consists of a diverse group of students and community members who love to sail and is part of the University Boating Center, whose mission is to promote the sport of sailing through education, community engagement, and competition.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f93f40b88072701752a34ca3b80918ec"><name>english-proficiency</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researcher wins $1 million grant to study English-language proficiency practices</title><summary>Peggy Estrada, an associate research scientist in Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded a three-year $999,999 grant to study how to best help school-age English learners achieve English language proficiency and academic excellence.</summary><start-date>1481651400000</start-date><display-name>English proficiency study</display-name><path>/2016/12/english-proficiency</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/english-proficiency</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1481650420673</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481652426373</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/estrada-peggy-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/estrada-peggy-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>estrada-peggy-350.jpg</name><display-name>estrada-peggy-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>129929</file-size><width>350</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>peggy estrada</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/estrada-paggy-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/estrada-paggy-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>estrada-paggy-80.jpg</name><display-name>estrada-paggy-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>13620</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>peggy estrada</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Peggy Estrada, an associate research scientist in Latin American and Latino studies, will investigate how to best help school-age English learners achieve language proficiency and academic excellence.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Peggy Estrada, an associate research scientist in Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded a three-year $999,999 grant to study how to best help school-age English learners achieve English language proficiency and academic excellence.</p>
<p>Estrada said 43 percent of California K-12 students have a primary language at home other than English. Students who do not score English proficient on a state test when they enter school are classified as English learners. Nationwide, they are the fastest growing proportion of public school enrollment.</p>
<p>&#8220;English learners are those who do not pass, and they are entitled to language and support services,&#8221; Estrada said. To be reclassified as fluent English proficient in California, students must pass the state proficiency test along with additional content achievement criteria.</p>
<p>The grant is a Lyle Spencer Research Award from the Spencer Foundation called &#8220;English Learner Achievement in Elementary School: Classroom Composition and Opportunity to Learn.&#8221; With it, Estrada and colleagues Timea Farkas, an assistant research scientist in Latin American and Latino studies, and Claude Goldenberg, professor of education at Stanford University, plan to conduct a small-scale experiment involving 16 schools in a large California school district, one of the biggest in the country with a large population of English learning students.</p>
<p>They will investigate classroom composition for English learners, particularly English learner separation or integration with other students and how that affects their opportunity to learn. &#160;&#8220;Different districts have different policies,&#8221; Estrada said. &#8220;Some separate English learners, others mix them with other students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Estrada said one way school districts attempt to improve instruction for English learners is through classroom composition policies that prescribe the mix by language status (English learners; English learners reclassified as fluent; initially fluent English proficient; and English only) and also by the number of English proficiency levels&#8212;beginning through advanced.</p>
<p>Little research has been done on whether mixing or separating English learners is more likely to promote English proficiency and achievement. Is it better to include English-only students with English learners? What about including students who started out as English learners and are now proficient? Also, how do classroom practices such as English language arts instruction differ depending on the composition of students? How do students perform under these different conditions?</p>
<p>Estrada and her colleagues plan to investigate using a class-composition experiment, classroom observations of English language arts instruction, and teacher and school administrator surveys and interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re examining three questions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;First, do English language arts classroom practices differ depending on the classroom composition, and if so, how? Second, do classroom practices and classroom composition each predict student achievement? And finally, &#8220;if we find a relation between classroom composition and student achievement, is that accounted for by classroom practices?&#8221;</p>
<p>Estrada said school districts in California have a lot of leeway regarding how they tackle the education of English learners and &#8220;research on this topic is extremely scarce.&#8221;&#160; She is hoping that the results of her research &#8220;will inform our understanding about how classroom composition affects classroom practices, students&#8217; opportunity to learn, and achievement.&#8221; Additionally, she hopes the results will point to policies with high potential to promote both better instruction and achievement.</p>
<p>The Spencer Foundation was established in 1962 by Lyle M. Spencer and focused on education. It received its major endowment after Spencer's death in 1968 and began formal grant making in 1971. The Lyle Spencer Research Awards program was introduced in 2014 as the successor to the foundation's major research grants program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fec85d128072701752a34ca33071fb33"><name>duane-energy-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The big business of climate change</title><summary>To seriously tackle climate change, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by at least 80 percent by 2050, according to "From Risk to Return: Investing in a Clean Energy," a new report whose lead author is Tim Duane, a UC Santa Cruz professor of environmental studies. </summary><start-date>1481743800000</start-date><path>/2016/12/duane-energy-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/duane-energy-study</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1481743292414</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481745022258</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/tim-duane-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/tim-duane-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tim-duane-250.jpg</name><display-name>tim-duane-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>61458</file-size><width>250</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt>tim duane</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/tim-duane-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/tim-duane-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tim-duane-80.jpg</name><display-name>tim-duane-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>9772</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>tim duane</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Environmental studies profesor Tim Duane</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/duane1-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/duane1-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>duane1-450.jpg</name><display-name>duane1-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>33176</file-size><width>450</width><height>261</height></image><image-alt>chart showing </image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/duane2-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/duane2-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>duane2-450.jpg</name><display-name>duane2-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>48113</file-size><width>450</width><height>498</height></image><image-alt>chart showing </image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Environmental studies professor Tim Duane is lead author of a study that analyzes investment pathways for clean energy</article-subhead><article-text><p>To seriously tackle climate change, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by at least 80 percent by 2050, according to a new report from the <a href="https://riskybusiness.org/">Risky Business Project</a>, a nonpartisan research initiative launched in 2013 by Michael Bloomberg, Henry Paulson, and Thomas Steyer.&#160;<br/>

<br/>
 The report, "<a href="http://riskybusiness.org/fromrisktoreturn/">From Risk to Return: Investing in a Clean Energy Economy</a>," finds that reducing greenhouse gases does not require an energy miracle or any unprecedented spending&#8212;but it does require a significant shift in investment patterns.<br/>
<br/>
 The solution is already here: a switch to clean energy while electrifying transportation and improving energy efficiency in buildings and industry.<br/>

 Duane is considered a leading expert on &#8220;greening the grid&#8221; and the regulatory permitting challenges of renewable energy development. With more than three decades of professional experience in energy, climate, land use, natural resources, water, and environmental policy, planning, and law, he began working in the renewable energy industry in 1979 and published his first reports discussing climate change in 1990.&#160; He has advised public agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private corporations.<br/>
<br/>
 A transition to clean energy would benefit not just the environment but also the economy at large. By 2030, 1 million new jobs would be created. The savings of reduced or eliminated fossil fuel costs would also grow significantly every decade so that by 2040, $700 billion per year could be saved. The utility sector could also see long-term growth, and transportation could be transformed through electric and energy-efficient cars.<br/>
<br/>
 The capital investment required from the private sector is $220 billion per year from 2020 to 2030, with costs climbing to $410 billion per year from 2030 to 2040 and $360 billion per year from 2040 to 2050. The report also outlines challenges for industries currently benefiting from a fossil-fuel economy: coal mining, and oil and gas-related jobs could face job losses.<br/>
<br/>
 The authors say this level of investment is comparable to other historic and necessary investments, like building roads and recent investment in computers and software. Since 1994, investments in communications equipment and infrastructure is more than $2 trillion. When put into this context, the cost for a clean energy switch is not beyond what is feasible.<br/>
<br/>
 This investment is also necessary if U.S. businesses want to remain competitive on a national and global level, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
 Without large-scale investments, the economic impacts of climate change will be devastating. These investments would be less compared with the costs brought on by failing to respond to climate change and fossil fuel dependence.<br/>
<br/>
 In response to the report, Donna Shalala, president of the Clinton Foundation and a member of the Risk Committee, remarks &#8220;Climate change presents systemic risks to our economy, to public health, and particularly to our most vulnerable communities. Now we outline a way forward&#8212;we can achieve a clean energy economy that reduces these risks and increases prosperity, health, and resilience.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://riskybusiness.org/fromrisktoreturn/</url><title>From Risk to Return: Investing in a Clean Energy Economy</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://riskybusiness.org/</url><title>Risky Business Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ff12a74f8072701752a34ca3717c12da"><name>caldwell-living-faithfully</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anthropologist's new book explores compassionate care and community in Moscow</title><summary>"How and why do people engage with social problems and injustices?" asks UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Melissa Caldwell in her new book, "Living Faithfully in an Unjust World: Compassionate Care in Russia."</summary><start-date>1481748000000</start-date><display-name>Living Faithfully, Melissa Caldwell</display-name><path>/2016/12/caldwell-living-faithfully</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/caldwell-living-faithfully</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1481748161098</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1482269222998</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/caldwell-book-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/caldwell-book-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>caldwell-book-200.jpg</name><display-name>caldwell-book-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>50701</file-size><width>200</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/caldwell-melissa-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/caldwell-melissa-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>caldwell-melissa-80.jpg</name><display-name>caldwell-melissa-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14834</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>melissa caldwell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/caldwell-melissa-520.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/caldwell-melissa-520.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>caldwell-melissa-520.jpg</name><display-name>caldwell-melissa-520.jpg</display-name><file-size>165121</file-size><width>520</width><height>379</height></image><image-alt>melissa caldwell</image-alt><image-caption>Over the 20 years anthropology professor Melissa Caldwell has spent conducting ethnographic research in Russia, she has seen social welfare programs dissolve and neoliberal economic policies appear. (Photo by Melissa De Witte)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>"How and why do people engage with social problems and injustices?&#8221; asks UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Melissa Caldwell in her new book, <em><a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520285842">Living Faithfully in an Unjust World: Compassionate Care in Russia</a></em> (University of California Press, 2016).<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;What does it mean to care for or to love another person, especially a complete stranger?&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 To find answers, Caldwell turned to Russia&#8217;s faith-based communities where she met people caring for some of Moscow&#8217;s most vulnerable populations.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <strong>Life post-Soviet dissolution</strong><br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Caldwell describes how for many post-Soviet Russians, it was hard to adjust to the country&#8217;s political and economic transformation when the country dissolved in 1991.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;My field notes from the 1990s and 2000s are filled with stories from friends and acquaintances who were frustrated by what seemed to them to be a dramatic rupture of the social compact that they believed previously knitted their society together,&#8221; she writes.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Over the 20 years Caldwell has spent conducting ethnographic research in Russia, she has seen social welfare programs dissolve and neoliberal economic policies appear. This new political economy has made way for joblessness, homelessness, poverty, and intense socioeconomic stratification.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <strong>Social work</strong><br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 In the absence of state-sponsored welfare programs, Caldwell found that members of faith-based communities have become de facto social workers: delivering meals, providing shelter, offering care, and giving counsel to those in need. Essentially, church organizations now provide the public service that the socialist state had previously filled.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Caldwell introduces readers to a variety of individuals in Moscow, including Pastor Ivan, a minister at a Protestant congregation known for helping Russian orphans and prisoners.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;Pastor Ivan reflected that in Moscow, there were many people who had realized that there was more to life than simply making money and they wanted to find ways to live meaningfully by helping others,&#8221; Caldwell shares.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;He noted that without an organizational structure such as that offered by churches, people want to help but cannot; consequently, churches have important roles to play in providing specific and structured ways to help.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <strong>Justice and human rights</strong><br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Caldwell found that the type of work faith-based communities engage in is a type of activism grounded not only in compassion and kindness but also social justice and humanitarianism.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Moscow&#8217;s faith-based organizations must establish themselves as a religious community while also demonstrating they are more than religious and even non-religious, Caldwell says. She also found that many congregants worked or volunteered for social welfare projects across the city, and used the social hour after church services to find additional support and allies for their work. She also documented the extent to which many faith-based communities had close ties with international NGOs and humanitarian groups &#8211; connections that are often overlooked by critics of faith-based assistance programs but that are highly valued by international aid organizations and Russian government agencies and officials.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 For example, the minister and several staff members at the Christian Church of Moscow (CCM) underwent trainings sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration in order to work with asylum seekers who were hoping to gain refugee status and become eligible for resettlement. CCM eventually established its own NGO to administer these and other support services.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;As a result of this added responsibility, the church&#8217;s social ministries had expanded beyond social services to include an explicit human rights dimension,&#8221; says Caldwell.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 In the words of Pastor Mark, a minister at CCM, &#8220;I am never just a pastor. There is more to it than that. It is important to be involved in the social reality that surrounds us. As a pastor, it is about reaching out for those around you, reaching out for your neighbor, as Scripture would say.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 For Pastor Mark, and others Caldwell encountered in Moscow&#8217;s faith-based communities, social work and spirituality intertwine: working with, through, and for each other. Faith is connected to civic life, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Katrina was the top fundraiser at the St. Baldrick&#8217;s head-shaving event, raising just over $14,000 for childhood cancer research and helping propel the&#160;<a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> to the top of the charts for the second Battle of the Bald, an annual <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/battle">college charity fundraiser</a> hosted by St. Baldrick&#8217;s, a <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/blog/post/what-is-st-baldricks">childhood cancer foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Katrina&#8217;s daughter&#160;<a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/kids/Aurora">Aurora</a>&#160;was diagnosed with&#160;<a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/blog/post/types-of-childhood-cancer-neuroblastoma">neuroblastoma</a>, a type of <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/about-childhood-cancer">childhood cancer</a>, when she was 2 months old. Aurora&#8217;s hair loss as a result of chemotherapy is something Katrina remembers vividly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was actually kind of a defining moment for me in her treatment because Aurora didn&#8217;t have any symptoms when she was diagnosed,&#8221; Katrina said. &#8220;It felt so counterintuitive to pump her full of toxic chemicals. It [the hair loss] was just a visible and physical reminder of what we were putting her body through, of the kind of treatment she had to receive to be alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that kind of treatment she is working to change &#8212; with her career, and through her fundraising for St. Baldrick&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Katrina works for the <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a>, a Genomics Institute research project project supported by St. Baldrick&#8217;s funding. Using comparative genomics, Genomics Institute researchers hope to create more individualized and less toxic methods of treatment for kids with cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is that every child has this personalized treatment option,&#8221; said Michelle Riddle, the Treehouse Initiative&#8217;s marketing manager and the volunteer event organizer of the UCSC Genomics Institute head-shaving event. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard too many stories of children that aren&#8217;t dying of cancer &#8212; they&#8217;re dying from the treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Genomics data<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Combining her background as a genomics data analyst with her desire to find cures for pediatric cancer, Katrina teamed up with Genomics Institute researcher Olena Morozova, and the Treehouse Initiative was born. Katrina wanted her shave to make a big impact, so she set a firm goal and didn&#8217;t back down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept thinking &#8216;I don&#8217;t know if I can do this&#8217; earlier in the month while I was raising money,&#8221; Katrina said. &#8220;But then I thought, &#8216;I&#8217;m lucky I have the choice.&#8217; So many kids, they don&#8217;t have a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what would a successful event be without a superstar volunteer event organizer? Six months ago, Michelle was just starting her new job with the Treehouse Initiative. Her first big project? Organizing their St. Baldrick&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>It was no small feat, but all the hard work paid off. Now, the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute gets to take home the Bald Cup &#8212; and Katrina, as the top fundraiser in the Battle, will get a free year of haircuts, courtesy of St. Baldrick&#8217;s national partner,&#160;Sport Clips Haircuts.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the cause is what matters most &#8212; to St. Baldrick&#8217;s <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/be-a-shavee">shavees</a>, volunteers, and the Treehouse team. Because of childhood cancer research, Aurora is now three years cancer free. Now, she has a chance to grow up &#8212; a chance Katrina believes all kids with cancer deserve to have.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what inspires Katrina to keep fundraising, and to keep doing the work she does for the Treehouse Initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel so fortunate and want every kid who gets diagnosed with cancer to have that same chance. More than a chance &#8212; we want that to be what they expect. What they can rely on.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was one of 37 colleges and universities across the United States that took part in St. Baldrick's Battle of the Bald, a competition to see which school could raise the most money for childhood cancer research. UCSC was announced the winner after raising more than $28,000, with 37 people shaving their heads during the campus event. The tournament raised more than $235,000 collectively.</p>

<p>More than 52,000 students&#8212;a new record&#8212;applied to be new first-year students for the fall 2017 quarter, a 6.9 percent increase from the previous year. The UC application deadline for transfer students <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-extends-deadline-transfer-applications">was extended</a> to Jan. 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students from around the world want to be a part of our phenomenal campus,&#8221; said Michael McCawley, director of admissions. &#8220;Undergraduates continue to experience UCSC as a university that joins undergraduate research opportunities, hands-on learning, and a commitment to social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz saw a 6.4 percent increase in the number of California high school seniors applying. Worldwide awareness continues to grow about the campus&#8217;s blend of high-impact research with tight-knit communities of learning, similar to small liberal arts colleges. Applications from out-of-state students increased by 2.5 percent and from international students by 13 percent.</p>
<p>There was also increased interest from ethnically diverse California students. The campus received more freshman applications from African Americans (6.5 percent more); from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (5.7 percent more); and Chicanos/Latinos (11 percent more).</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last year, we have worked very hard with other members of the UCSC community to further diversify the campus, and these numbers are an indication that those efforts are working,&#8221; said McCawley. &#8220;We want students from all backgrounds to know that UCSC is an inclusive and safe environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a time when hateful rhetoric has targeted many groups&#8212;including undocumented students, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer communities, women, and international students&#8212;UC Santa Cruz continues to promote a community built on mutual respect, trust, and compassion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is an integral part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s mission to teach, discover, and serve,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;We strive to be an exceptionally inclusive campus, celebrating differences that strengthen our community and supporting students and their many identities in and out of the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz, which became a Hispanic-Serving Institution in 2012, was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/hsi-student-success.html">recently awarded a $5.7 million grant</a>, its third major HSI grant from the U.S. Department of Education, to support efforts to keep Latino and low-income students on a path to graduating with degrees in science and engineering.</p>
<p>Admissions staff anticipate that a higher percentage of students will accept UC Santa Cruz admissions offers in spring, following the global recognition of research done by Professor Harry Noller, who <a href="http://reports.news.ucsc.edu/breakthrough/">was awarded</a> a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences earlier this month revealing how the complex molecular machines called ribosomes translate genetic code and build the proteins in all living cells, thereby connecting modern biology to the origin of life.</p>
<p>The Breakthrough Prize, founded by leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin, honors paradigm-shifting research in the fields of fundamental physics, life sciences, and mathematics.</p>
<p>This year, UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/us-news-world-report-rankings.html">ranked 30th</a> in the U.S. News and World Report&#8217;s list of top public national universities. Additionally, the campus&#8217;s commitment to sustainability was underscored by the Princeton Review&#8217;s list of top green colleges. UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/princeton-green.html">ranked No. 7</a>.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students who arrive in the fall will be part of the campus&#8217;s residential college communities for living and learning, as well as host of special programs, including the Scholars Program, Smith Society, and ever expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p>Like the eight other UC campuses that admit undergraduate students, UC Santa Cruz will aim to increase the number of total California undergraduates as part of UC President Janet Napolitano&#8217;s plan to increase systemwide enrollment of California undergraduates in the next two years.</p>
<p>Undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions and waitlist invitations beginning mid-March. Admitted first-year students have until May 1 to indicate their intent to enroll and transfers until June 1.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/california-freshman-applications-uc-continue-record-breaking-climb</url><title>California freshman applications to UC continue record-breaking climb</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/student-workforce-pages/2017-applications.html</url><title>Fall 2017 Application Tables</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1da7b8b28072701752a34ca301c866c7"><name>year-in-review-feature-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A year of risks and rewards at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>From a dramatic Quarry renovation groundbreaking to an extraordinary recognition for groundbreaking research, 2016 at UC Santa Cruz was full to bursting with accomplishments and accolades&#13;

Students and faculty got creative, and took big, bold risks.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/quarry-amphitheater-groundbreak-feature.html">early November groundbreaking ceremony for the campus&#8217;s beloved but long-shuttered Quarry Amphitheater,</a> which is about to undergo an ambitious renovation program that will restore its former glory while updating this gathering spot for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>The organizers of the ceremony could have taken the easy route by topping off the ceremony with a ribbon cutting and a few shovels full of dirt. Instead, Alison Galloway, in one of her final acts as campus provost and executive vice chancellor, brought the event to its conclusion by driving to the front of the amphitheater in a rumbling backhoe, then lowering the bucket loader to reveal the words &#8220;LET&#8217;S GET IT STARTED!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was just one of countless examples of UC Santa Cruz taking an unconventional path and standing out from the crowd. Here are a few other selected highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Honoring her legacy</strong></p>
<p>In one of the most well-attended and highly anticipated ceremonies of the year, College Eight, long known for its eco-minded students and projects, finally got a moniker worthy of its lofty mission.</p>
<p>In early October, the college was rededicated as <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/rachel-carson-college-dedication-feature.html">Rachel Carson College</a>, in honor of the environmental visionary who wrote the groundbreaking 1962 environmental science book&#160;<em>Silent Spring</em>. This was a fitting moment for a college that has <a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2016/10/natural-allies/">fought long and hard to champion Carson&#8217;s values</a>, with such projects as the Predatory Bird Research Group, which started off at an office in the college in 1975.</p>
<p>A naming gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation recognized Carson for her courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues.</p>
<p><strong>Collision spaces, generosity, and thinking big</strong></p>
<p>When UC Santa Cruz held its <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/founders-celebration-2016-wrapup-feature.html">2016 Founders Celebration,</a> recognizing excellence and generosity,&#160;it could have rented an auditorium somewhere. But that would have been a little too predictable. Instead, the organizers took the untried and true approach by turning the campus&#8217;s Science &amp; Engineering Library into a thoughtful and upscale party space that was also a meeting of the minds.</p>
<p>This made sense, considering the library itself is now undergoing <a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2016/10/collision-vision/">a thoughtful renovation that will update this space</a> for the 21st century, turning it into a more interactive, wired, and lively campus hub, a place for a variety of thoughs and avenues of inquiry to "collide" and spark dynamic new ideas.&#160;</p>
<p>And speaking of collision spaces, UC Santa Cruz brought <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/julie-snyder-feature-story.html">Julie Snyder</a> (Kresge '95, politics), co-creator of the wildly successful <em>Serial</em> podcast, to campus to receive the Alumni Achievement Award. The podcast, which she created with cohort Sarah Koenig, is an exciting &#8220;collision&#8221; between old-fashioned reporting, the intimacy of interviews and storytelling, and cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p><strong>Getting cosmic</strong></p>
<p>In the scientific realm, UC Santa Cruz showed its grand ambitions, and got grand results and great recognitions in return.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz biologist Harry Noller capped off the year in a very big way when he won the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/noller-prize.html">$3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences</a> for revealing how the molecular machines known as ribosomes translate genetic code and build proteins in all living cells. &#8220;Harry Noller has performed a tour de force in molecular biology for the past 50 years,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;This recognition is well-deserved.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same dramatic year, UC Santa Cruz&#160;astronomer Garth Illingworth and his collaborators <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/galaxy-record.html">continued to push the limits of current telescopes</a> to study the most distant galaxies, breaking the record twice within a year.</p>
<p>The campus also continued to do its part in the war against a deadly and pernicious disease by suggesting <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/prostate-cancer.html">treatment options for prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/07/treehouse-grant.html">getting crucial support</a> for its Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists did a fine job of showing <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/coastal-wetlands.html">the strong economic benefits of habitat preservation</a> with a study showing that coastal wetlands save hundreds of millions of dollars in flood damages during hurricanes.</p>
<p>Some of the scientific findings were sobering for anyone who is concerned with the health of our planet. Take, for example, a study showing that the current rate of carbon emissions is <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/carbon-emissions.html">unprecedented in the past 66 million years.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/zavaleta-bioscience.html">a study drew links between nitrogen pollution threats and endangered species.</a></p>
<p>But there was also encouraging and even uplifting news on the environmental front. Scientists also did a fine job of showing that <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/island-extinctions.html">island creatures can be protected from extinction</a>, especially when <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/island-biodiversity.html">invasive and voracious critters</a> are removed from those islands.&#160;</p>
<p>And speaking of environmental boons on campus, UC Santa Cruz got high honors for its sustainability practices in <em>Sierra</em>, the magazine published by the Sierra Club, the mighty environmental organization whose founders included John Muir. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/cool-schools.html">Cool school, indeed!</a></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz also proved that <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/gold-ranking.html">&#8220;gold is the new green</a>&#8221; by getting a gold rating for sustainability from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainabilty in Higher Education.</p>
<p><strong>Artistic riches and creative visionaries</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz excelled in the sciences, but it also made its mark in the arts and humanities. This fall, the campus received an extraordinary windfall&#8212;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html">the photography collection of Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch</a>, plus works by Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, and Edward Weston, valued at $32 million&#8212;a treasury of photographs like no other.</p>
<p>And it looks like the word about a few of our best-kept cultural secrets has been getting out in a big way. UC Santa Cruz also received $1 million to support the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/nion-gift-ias.html">Institute of the Arts and Sciences</a>, and a film by a UC Santa Cruz art professor got <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/jones-oscar-nomination.html">nominated for an Academy Award.</a></p>
<p>And who says arts and humanities belong inside an ivory tower? Creative-minded people on&#160;campus had many "straight off the headlines" moments this year, whether they were leading a talk about <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/anger-in-politics.html">anger in politics from Shakespeare to Trump</a> or contributing to <em>Time</em> magazine&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/07/time-magazine-stovall.html">25 moments that changed America</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creativity, history, and technology helped shine a new light on a tragic corner of the past when a history professor created a new <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/greg-omalley-slavetrade.html">public database about the slave trade</a>. Faculty also gazed into the future, wondering what life might be like for pedestrians <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/pedestrians-self-driving-cars.html">when self-driving cars become the norm</a> instead of novelties.</p>
<p><strong>The Slugs are back!</strong></p>
<p>This was also a year for even more student success. The campus saw growth in enrollment and welcomed a&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/fall-class-diversity-access.html">more diverse group of incoming first-year students as well as transfer students</a> as part of a UC-wide plan to enroll 5,000 more undergraduates. The campus also embarked on an equity initiative for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/hsi-student-success.html">Latino, low-income students in STEM fields</a>.</p>
<p>Alumni Slugs also got their day in the sun. Martha Mendoza (Kresge,&#160;&#8217;88, independent major, journalism and education) and William Finnegan (Cowell,&#160;'74, English literature) <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/pulitzers-mendoza-finnegan.html">both won Pulitzer Prizes</a>.</p>
<p>And speaking of Slugs in high places, a Ph.D. graduate in international economics became the incoming <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/07/zhang-tao-imf.html">deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund.</a></p>
<p>With 2016 bursting with accomplishments, recognitions, and accolades for UC Santa Cruz, we can't wait to see how the campus builds on its success in the year ahead.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1de5b40e8072701752a34ca34ae7592b"><name>in-memoriam-dennis-mcelrath</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Dennis McElrath</title><summary>Dennis McElrath, a sociology professor, was the Stevenson College provost (1985-1991) and a founding member of the college.</summary><start-date>1482246000000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam</display-name><path>/2016/12/in-memoriam-dennis-mcelrath</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/in-memoriam-dennis-mcelrath</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1482265308930</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1482266873134</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/mcelrath300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/mcelrath300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mcelrath300px.jpg</name><display-name>mcelrath300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>52416</file-size><width>300</width><height>206</height></image><image-alt>Dennis McElrath</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dennis McElrath, Stevenson provost (1985-1991) and founding member of the Stevenson College and Sociology Department faculty died on November 15 2016. Dennis joined the Sociology Department as an associate professor in 1965. He served two terms as Stevenson provost and twice was the chair of the Academic Senate (1983-84 and 1992-93). Dennis also served as Director of the Padua Study Center in the Education Abroad Program for two years starting in 1974. Stevenson College is saddened by the loss of a great servant to the college system and to the university as a whole.</p>
<p>Dennis earned his PhD from Yale University in 1958 and worked at USC and Northwestern University and was a Fulbright Research Scholar at the Universities of Padua and Rome before joining the faculty at UCSC at the opening of the new university in 1965. Dennis served as assistant to Charles Page, the first provost of Stevenson College, and together they recruited the first fifty faculty to Stevenson College and the then Boards of Study (now called academic departments). Charles and Dennis were able to hire five female faculty in that first six months, a point of pride when compared to Cowell College's one female hire.</p>

UC Santa Cruz signed a 20-year lease for two three-floor modules at the Enterprise Technology Centre in Scotts Valley.</p>
<p>The move is on schedule and will occur in phases beginning this month and going through March.</p>
<ul>
<li>University Relations staff based at the 2155 Delaware Ave. building are scheduled to move first, during the last week of December.</li>
<li>Staff in Information Technology Services (ITS), Internal Audit, the Real Estate Office (REO), BAS Operations and Resource Management and Vice Chancellor&#8217;s office, and Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services (CHES) are scheduled to move next, with the move expected to be complete in mid-January.</li>
<li>Staff Human Resources will move at the end of January.</li>
<li>Business and Administrative Services staff in Financial Affairs will move in early March.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bringing hundreds of staff members together will better support collaboration across divisions. This change will necessitate the better use of technology for meetings so that participants can be fully engaged regardless of location.</p>
<p>UC has signed a systemwide contract with a video teleconferencing service, called Zoom, that along with Google Hangouts and other videoconferencing software will enable virtual meetings between employees in any location, reducing the need to drive between locations. A workgroup has <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/videoconferencing/meeting-guidance.html">created a useful guide</a> in order to help ease the transition to utilizing more teleconferencing.</p>
<p>The Scotts Valley Center project frees up space at 2300 Delaware Ave., a university-owned building that will be used for much-needed academic and research-oriented space for the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the Baskin School of Engineering, and the Division of the Arts. Renovation work has already begun, with researchers moving in over the next several years.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway and Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1eab40018072701752a34ca38368fe62"><name>shr-apo-labor-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scheduled Labor Strike at UC campuses on January 10, 2017</title><summary>The University has been informed that there will be a clerical union labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers on January 10, 2017.</summary><start-date>1481875200000</start-date><display-name>Labor Activity</display-name><path>/2016/12/shr-apo-labor-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/shr-apo-labor-message</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1482278255340</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1482278255340</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California has been informed that there will be a clerical union labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers on January 10, 2017. Up to date information will be provided on the <a href="http://ucsc.edu">UCSC website</a>. For questions, you may call your Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst or email at <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu">elrinfo@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>UC and Teamsters have been unable to reach agreement on new contracts, and the union has called for a systemwide strike. At this time, we do not know how these strike activities will impact our campus. However, as we know from past experience, there is the possibility that access to the main campus may be impeded. We offer the following guidance to help you and your employees plan in advance:</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Employees are expected to work their normal schedules on January 10, 2016. Please instruct your employees to check campus accessibility before they come to work. Information will be posted on a special web site: http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/, recorded on the campus communication hotline (459-INFO), provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast, and shared via the campus Twitter account (http://twitter.com/#!/ucsc). If access to the campus is not possible, further instructions to employees will be posted via these channels.</p>
<p><strong>Work Flexibility</strong>: In order to minimize the number of people attempting to access the campus, employee requests to work from home or for an alternate work site may be considered and approved based on operational needs. We encourage you to be as flexible as possible when considering these requests from your employees.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Vacation or Compensatory Time Off (CTO)</strong>: Managers and supervisors may approve advance requests to schedule vacation or CTO (overtime leave) in accordance with policy and labor agreements and as it is customarily administered within your unit/division. Employees requesting vacation or CTO due to concerns about their safety should be granted the time off.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Sick Leave</strong>: You may require that employees provide reasonable documentation to support their request for sick leave if the requested day off is concurrent with the strike day. Managers and supervisors should notify employees within a reasonable period of time before the strike that medical documentation will be required.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Union Business Leave</strong>: Please forward the employee&#8217;s request to the Employee &amp; Labor Relations&#8217; Administrative Specialist, Jennifer May, at 459&#8211;1873 or jemay@ucsc.edu.</p>
<p><strong>Absence without Approval</strong>: If the campus is accessible and an employee is absent without advance approval to use vacation or compensatory time off and has not called in sick, then the day should be recorded as an unapproved absence and the employee&#8217;s pay will be adjusted in accordance with policy and labor agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Recording Attendance</strong>: Employee attendance will be reported as normal through Cruz Pay and other time reporting practices. In order to assess the impact of the strike, we may ask supervisors or units to provide additional information on absences or cancelled classes for a report to the Office of the President.</p>
<p><strong>Absence due to Inaccessibility</strong>: If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who are expected to work but are unable to access the workplace. Employees should not be encouraged to enter the campus to work nor should they be transported onto campus if it is deemed inaccessible by the Police Chief.</p>
<p><strong>Health and Safety</strong>: It is important to ensure that your employees are advised that their safety is always the first priority. Employees should not be expected to jeopardize their safety in attempting to get to work if access to the campus is blocked. Please emphasize to your employees that they should follow the directions regarding campus access that will be communicated through the channels noted above.</p>
<p>For an overview of the campus strike plan, please visit the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/UCSC-Labor-Strike-Plan.pdf">UCSC Labor Strike Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Strike related questions should be forwarded to your <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/index.html">Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst</a> or <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu">by email</a>.</p>
<p>Please be assured that the campus is planning and preparing for the January 10 activities and will provide communication updates as additional information becomes known.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has been opening up new high-tech fronts in the battle against children&#8217;s diseases.</p>
<p>&#160;John "Bud" and Rebecca Colligan, longtime supporters of the Genomics Institute, have established the Colligan Presidential Chair in Pediatric Genomics with matching funds from the University of California Office of the President.</p>
<p>The endowed chair will support a distinguished member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty whose research involves pediatric genomics.</p>
<p>Efforts at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute to drive targeted treatment of diseases by unlocking the world's genomic information include a focus on pediatric cancer driven by the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative.</p>
<p>David Haussler, scientific director of the Genomics Institute, said that the Colligans have been &#8220;terrific supporters&#8221; of the Genomic Institute. He noted that the&#160;endowed chair will help the Institute build on its expertise in pediatric cancer while extending its efforts to fight other childhood diseases.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative was established to analyze genomic data of children with cancer in the context of large datasets of both pediatric and adult cancers. This allows researchers to identify situations where an available drug is predicted to work for a given patient's tumor. Treehouse promotes the sharing of pediatric cancer genomic data as well as the translation of the findings from this analysis to the clinical setting. Cofounded by Olena Morozova, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute, the initiative has grown rapidly and recently received a major grant from St. Baldrick's Foundation.</p>
<p>"Our pediatric cancer genomics program has been one of the fastest growing and most exciting programs in the Genomics Institute," Haussler said. "The focus on children's diseases is one that resonates with people here, and we've found that it's an area where our emphasis on data sharing can really make a difference."</p>
<p>Increasing support for endowed chairs is a goal of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which has raised more than $286 million for the campus.</p>
<p>"Rebecca and I wanted to support the growth and world-class research of the Genomics Institute, and we felt particularly strongly about helping children who are suffering from rare diseases," said Bud Colligan. "The Genomics Institute has been coming up with approaches to treating pediatric cancer that have never been tried before."</p>
<p>"It's especially exciting that this pediatric research is happening right in our own backyard at UC Santa Cruz, and we wanted to support that effort," added Rebecca Colligan.</p>
<p>The Colligan family has had a decades-long impact along the Central Coast. Bud Colligan is the Co-Chair of the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership and the founder and CEO of South Swell Ventures. Rebecca Colligan is an artist who had a successful career in photography and now works in mixed media and oil painting.</p>
<p>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future. It is bringing critical new resources to each academic division, and to signature initiatives in the Student Experience, Genomics and Health, Coastal Sustainability, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, and Data Science Leadership.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0df9d46c80727017179a822620d389a1"><name>housing-more-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Housing more students on campus</title><summary>Through a combination of renovation and new construction, our goal is to generate approximately 3,000 beds, allowing us to restore lounges, reduce overcrowding, and meet the on-campus housing demand among students.</summary><start-date>1481097600000</start-date><display-name>Housing more students on campus</display-name><path>/2016/12/housing-more-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/12/housing-more-students</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1494883094296</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1494883094296</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="gmail_quote">

<p>UC Santa Cruz houses a greater percentage of undergraduates on campus than any other campus in the UC system&#8212;53 percent. That&#8217;s a point of pride for us, as research shows that living on campus is a critical factor in student success and retention. It also helps mitigate our impact on the local community.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have a serious problem. Converting double rooms to triples has helped us meet demand, and it&#8217;s a more affordable option for students, but our current campus housing density isn&#8217;t optimal. As of this fall, almost every lounge has been converted to a quad, and we lack the capacity to accommodate students who would live on campus if we had room for them.</p>
<p>And the pressure is only increasing. This fall, our campus enrolled 650 more Californians than a year ago as part of UC&#8217;s systemwide commitment to enroll 10,000 more in-state students through 2018. At the same time, off-campus housing options are vanishing. Santa Cruz County&#8217;s housing shortage is making international headlines as competition from Silicon Valley and vacation rentals drive up prices and reduce already-constrained availability.</p>
<p>We hear from students every day that the campus has reached a breaking point, and we agree. We know we must provide more housing for our students. In recent years, we have developed plans to renovate and add new housing on the west side of campus.</p>
<p>Until recently, however, we have been unable to move forward, due to various financial constraints, including cost of delivery and campus debt capacity. As a result, for more than a decade, we have been unable to undertake any substantial new housing construction on campus.</p>
<p>We have accommodated enrollment increases&#8212;and remained in compliance with our legal commitment to the local community to house a significant portion of our student population&#8212;only by increasing density. Meanwhile, Santa Cruz County has added roughly one housing unit for every 10 new residents. On and off campus, demand is outpacing supply.</p>
<p>However, a new student-housing initiative launched by the UC Office of the President will allow us to build the housing we need by 2020 while focusing on affordability for students.</p>
<p>Through a combination of renovation and new construction, our goal is to generate approximately 3,000 beds, allowing us to restore lounges, reduce overcrowding, and meet the on-campus housing demand among students. The first new beds will be online in three years.</p>
<p>Although other UC campuses have used public-private partnerships (P3), we will be the first to participate in the Office of the President&#8217;s new systemwide program. This new model will identify a short-list of developers from across the state and beyond who will be able to bid on housing projects on participating campuses. The potential to deliver a large number of beds is attractive to prospective developers; there has already been a high level of interest from the development community. This benefits a campus such as UC Santa Cruz, where the construction challenges include our remote location, our geology, and our proximity to Silicon Valley, which means we compete for contracts with developers who are focused on the lucrative market over the hill.</p>
<p>We are confident the P3 model will bring an influx of creative thinking and problem solving to our housing challenges. Student housing is our top priority, but we are using P3 to simultaneously explore ways to add faculty and staff housing, as well as child care for employees&#8211;the prospect of which may further entice developers to work with UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Embarking on a public-private partnership of this scale is new for this campus; we see it as a tremendous opportunity. What won&#8217;t change is our commitment to quality and our compliance with all applicable building standards, health and safety regulations, sustainability policies, and environmental review and compliance processes. This will be our project, and we will retain oversight.</p>
<p>We need to do our part to house more students on campus, because it&#8217;s the right thing for students, and because it will minimize our impact on town. This approach will maximize our investment while holding down costs for students. The next step comes early in 2017 when the campus issues a &#8220;request for proposals.&#8221; We will keep you informed as we make progress on this important campus initiative.</p>
