A new study, however, finds that insect diversity actually has not changed much over the past 125 million years.</p>
<p>It's not that no new insects have evolved. Rather, as new insects have evolved, others have gone extinct, leaving the overall diversity relatively unchanged, according to paleontologist Matthew Clapham, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, whose team published the new findings February 3 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>
<p>Previous studies of how insect diversity has changed over time used methods that artificially inflate the relative richness of younger (more recent) time intervals, Clapham said. These studies, as well as Clapham's, looked at the richness of the fossil record with respect to insect families, a broader taxonomic category than species and genus. The earlier studies were based on the first and last appearances of each family in the fossil record, and if there were still insects in that family living today its range was extended to the present.</p>
<p>"The problem is that the range we see in the fossil record is always smaller than the real range, because insects don't fossilize very well--they don't have bones or shells," Clapham explained. "By extending the range of extant families to the present, you increase diversity toward the present day. It's a known bias called 'the pull of the recent.'"</p>
<p><strong>Fossil database</strong></p>
<p>To avoid that bias, the researchers compiled a database with not only the first and last occurrences of each family, but essentially all available data on fossil insects. It took about three years and yielded a database of more than 39,000 insect fossil records representing about 25,000 species. Then they were able to use modern statistical methods to assess insect diversity over the past 325 million years.</p>
<p>"What we found when we used less biased statistical methods is that the incredible diversity of insects is not just a recent phenomenon. They were extremely diverse in the past as well," Clapham said.</p>
<p>Insects first appear in the fossil record in the Devonian Period, about 400 million years ago, but they don't become abundant until the Carboniferous about 325 million years ago. Insect diversity peaked about 125 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, and changes since then have been negligible, Clapham said. The early Cretaceous may be a period when older groups that have since declined overlapped with the diversification of newer groups.</p>
<p>"It's clear that certain groups that are very diverse today have diversified a lot recently, but other groups were probably just as diverse in the past and have declined," Clapham said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Flowering plants</strong></p>
<p>A lot of modern insect groups have close ecological and evolutionary relationships with flowering plants, and the evolution of flowering plants is thought to have spurred rapid diversification of insects. But the new analysis found that the evolution of flowering plants did not make a big difference in insect diversity overall. Presumably, there were many insects that had coevolved with the plants that were dominant before flowering plants came on the scene, and those insect groups would have declined along with the plants they depended on.</p>
<p>"Instead of a constant increase in diversity, what we see more often is some groups diversifying and other groups declining, so it balances out," Clapham said.</p>
<p>The study also looked at diversity at the species level and found similar trends, although the analysis is not as robust, he said. Factors that complicate species-level analysis include the spottiness of the fossil record and the fact that researchers are unlikely to publish the discovery of a fossil insect species that has already been described, even if it keeps showing up in different time periods.</p>
<p>"It makes the statistical methods hard to apply at the species level, because the published papers are a nonrandom sampling of the actual fossils," Clapham said. "As long as we're consistent in what we call a family, however, it seems likely that the average number of species per family hasn't changed much through time."</p>
<p>In addition to Clapham, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC graduate student Jered Karr; David Nicholson and Peter Mayhew at the University of York (U.K.); and Andrew Ross at the National Museum of Scotland.

A comprehensive study of water relations in native ferns, conducted during one of the worst droughts in California's recent history, shows that extreme conditions have tested the limits of drought tolerance in these plants.</p>
<p>"We've seen permanent dieback in some patches," said Jarmila Pittermann, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Pittermann's lab is studying ferns in the redwood forest on the UCSC campus. Over a period of 15 months in 2013 and 2014, the researchers closely monitored ferns at their study site, focusing on two common species in the redwood forest understory: the western swordfern <em>(Polystichum munitum)</em> and the coastal woodfern <em>(Dryopteris arguta)</em>.</p>
<p>"These understory species are important in themselves, but also serve as indicators of how climate change may affect our redwood forests," Pittermann said. "Considering that these plants are adapted to persist through a typical summer dry season, the dieback emphasizes just how unprecedented this drought has been over the past three years."</p>
<p>Her team collected data and samples at the study site every 10 days, including measurements of soil moisture, leaf temperature, hydration status of the plants, and how efficiently water moved through the fronds. They also conducted greenhouse experiments and laboratory tests.</p>
<p><strong>Water transport</strong></p>
<p>The results, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13770/abstract">published in <em>New Phytologist</em></a>, show that the fronds of these ferns can almost entirely lose the capacity to transport water by the end of the dry season, yet they can recover within 24 hours after a heavy rain. Despite this remarkable physiological resilience, however, an extended drought limits the plants' ability to photosynthesize and store energy. As a result, they may develop fewer new leaves in the spring and be more vulnerable to insects and diseases.</p>
<p>Ferns and other vascular plants transport water from roots to leaves through a system of pipe-like conduits called xylem. When a plant starts to experience water stress, its first response is to close the pores in its leaves. This reduces water loss, but also blocks the uptake of carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis. Under extreme water stress, the plant's hydraulic system starts to break down as air bubbles form in the xylem, causing "embolisms" that block water transport.</p>
<p>"We found that during the worst part of the drought in 2013, these ferns had extensive embolisms that severely compromised the ability of the xylem to conduct water," Pittermann said.</p>
<p>Although many plants would have a hard time recovering from this condition, the native ferns were able to recover quickly after heavy rains. Nevertheless, the extended periods of water stress during the drought greatly reduced their ability to conduct photosynthesis and perhaps their capacity to produce and store adequate levels of sugars and other carbon compounds in their underground rhizomes, Pittermann said.</p>
<p>"These plants are not accumulating enough carbon to support new growth in the spring," she said. "The implications are that they may not make enough spores to reproduce, and they may be more vulnerable to pests."</p>
<p><strong>Thrips</strong></p>
<p>Pittermann and others have noticed an increase in infestations of thrips, tiny insects that feed on plant sap, affecting ferns during the drought. Other observers in Marin County have reported thrips infestations and dieback of ferns in that area's redwood forests, including popular tourist sites such as Muir Woods.</p>
<p>The new study is the first of its kind in ferns or understory plants in general, and Pittermann has received funding from the Save the Redwoods League to conduct further research. The redwood forest ferns may be an important indicator of ecosystem change, she said, and continued drought could lead to a very different type of understory and might even threaten the redwoods themselves. "Redwoods are not deep-rooted trees, so an extended drought will eventually affect them too," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to Pittermann, the coauthors of the paper include graduate student Alex Baer (first author) and postdoctoral researcher James Wheeler. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9db25daf8072701704be48b575523874"><name>bikes-recovered</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cache of stolen bikes recovered</title><summary>If you believe any of these bikes belong to you, contact the SCPD Property Unit at scpdproperty@cityofsantacruz.com or (831) 420-5900.</summary><keywords>stolen bikes, santa cruz police, </keywords><start-date>1454342400000</start-date><display-name>Stolen bikes recovered</display-name><path>/2016/02/bikes-recovered</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/bikes-recovered</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1454344658315</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1454344658315</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Police Department recently discovered a cache of stolen bikes in Santa Cruz and is trying to get them back to their owners.</p>

During the week of Feb. 8, Physical Plant crews will conduct a campus water-main-flushing program.</p>
<p>Historically, this flushing program has been an annual event, however because of the prolonged drought and conservation considerations it has not been done in recent years.&#160; Water main flushing is a vital part of maintaining water-quality standards mandated by the state of California. It also assures availability of water at appropriate pressures in emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
 The flushing requires high flow for short periods of time and is done at key fire hydrant locations around campus.

<p><strong>About the staff advisors to the Regents:</strong></p>
<p>A continuing goal of the UC Regents is to foster two-way communication between UC staff and the board. In January 2007, the Regents voted unanimously to establish positions for two staff advisors to participate in their deliberative process and to provide a staff perspective on matters coming before the board.</p>
<p>One new staff advisor is selected each year for a two-year term. The staff advisors serve as non-voting advisors to designated Regents' committees; they attend and participate directly in committee and board meetings throughout their term of service, and visit many of the campuses to solicit input from staff. Eligible employees interested in public policy, advocacy and understanding the future direction of the university are encouraged to apply.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Non-Senate Academic Employees</audience><admin>Lori Castro, Acting Director, Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f4797048072701704be48b527e98422"><name>klemola-gift</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomy retiree Arnold Klemola establishes endowment for graduate students</title><summary>Gift of $400,000 establishes the James Keeler Fund for Excellence in Astronomy and Astrophysics.</summary><keywords>Arnold Klemola, James Keeler</keywords><start-date>1454515200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomy retiree Arnold Klemola establishes endowment for graduate students</display-name><path>/2016/02/klemola-gift</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/klemola-gift</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1454371215064</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548173394772</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/arnold-klemola-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/arnold-klemola-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arnold-klemola-375.jpg</name><display-name>arnold-klemola-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>67496</file-size><width>375</width><height>339</height></image><image-alt>Arnold Klemola</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/arnold-klemola-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/arnold-klemola-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arnold-klemola-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>arnold-klemola-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25524</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Arnold Klemola</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Arnold Klemola (photo by M.

The fund honors the contributions of Keeler, an early director of Lick Observatory who established the technology for large reflecting telescopes and pioneered their use for observing distant galaxies.</p>
<p>"Having this endowed fund gives us much needed flexibility to support graduate students and enhance their experience," said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. "Arnold Klemola clearly recognized the need for graduate student support and the importance of graduate students to the research we do. It's an amazing gift, and we are impressed by his vision of how he wants the funds to be used."</p>
<p>Klemola, who was the first in his family to go to college, expressed his interest in helping other first-in-family students. "Highly competent students of all backgrounds should be attracted to astronomy with help from the Keeler endowment," he said.</p>
<p>As a child, Klemola attended a small one-room school in Connecticut with one teacher and eight grades. "There was a tiny shelf with books, and one was on astronomy, so that was my first start toward astronomy," he said. "In those years, it was possible to mostly work your way through college with no debt afterward, which I did. Not so today."</p>
<p>Klemola earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy at Indiana University and a Ph.D. in astronomy at UC Berkeley. He came to UC Santa Cruz in 1967 and retired in 1992.</p>
<p>"He was a key member of the astronomy staff at Lick Observatory for many years," said Claire Max, director of UC Observatories and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics. "I was deeply moved by his desire to encourage first-in-family students to go on to exciting and challenging careers in astronomy. It's quite remarkable."</p>
<p>Klemola's legacies in astronomy include the discovery of Klemola's Comet&#8212;next visible from Earth in November 2019. The comet discovery was incidental to his greater lifetime work on the team that photographed the southern sky and then the northern sky for a second time, thereby showing how stars move around our galaxy.</p>

<p>The $3,000 awards allowed the two students to spend their summer researching issues impacting the coastal ecosystem. The seniors will present their experiences at <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/climate/">the third annual Climate Science and Policy conference</a> later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Hands-on learning</strong></p>
<p>&#160;The summer research Pineda conducted in ocean sciences professor Christina Ravelo&#8217;s lab laid the foundation for her senior thesis&#8211;which examines the denitrification process of the ocean floor. Pineda, a transfer student from Pasadena City College, began working with Ravelo two years ago as a work study student.</p>
<p>She remembers when a six-foot-long tube of ocean sediment arrived at the lab. &#8220;I was there when the core first arrived,&#8221; Pineda said. She helped examine each layer and is still in awe of how something so small in scale leads to results with big impact. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really see how everything connects and everything just happens,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All systems are connected to everything. The wind, the atmosphere, the ocean, all affects our climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrer is similarly struck by the how intense, varied, and even unpredictable the research process is. Ferrer spent the summer working with Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, &#160;to explore the impact of seawater pH. &#160;She helped recreate complex ecosystems in the lab, &#8220;which was hard to pull off,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ferrer &#160;remembers one night when the C02 machines in the lab went down, or when she had to find a fish that was out of season. &#8220;It was action packed summer,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>These types of hands-on learning experiences exemplify the goals of Keeley Coastal Scholar program: to give students the first-hand perspective of working in scientific research.</p>
<p>Pineda received the award for her paper "Climate Impacts on Upwelling, Biological Productivity, and Rainfall in Coastal Central Mexico Over the Last 2000 Years" and Ferrar for her research on "The Effects of Ocean Acidification on Predator-Prey Interaction in Seagrass Systems."</p>
<p><strong>Keeley Coastal Scholars Program</strong></p>
<p>The Keeley Coastal Scholars Program provides students from underrepresented groups in California the financial support to engage in summer research and policy work connected to coastal sustainability.</p>
<p>Many students find it they must work during the summer to finance their education. This causes an interruption of their academic studies and often precludes them from participating in intensive, faculty-led research proj&#173;ects. The Keeley scholarship helps make an uninterrupted focus possible &#8211; ultimately improving the academic experi&#173;ence while furthering research that addresses coastal sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>About Fred Keeley</strong></p>
<p>The award is named in recognition of Fred Keeley&#8217;s significant contributions to protect California&#8217;s natural environment and inspirational track record in environmental policy.</p>
<p>Keeley, who recently retired as Santa Cruz County Treasuer/Tax Collector, represented the Monterey Bay area in the California State Assembly from 1996 through 2002, and earlier served as a Santa Cruz County supervisor.</p>
<p>During his tenure in the state legislature he authored the Marine Life Management Act, which the Associated Press called the "most significant advancement in ocean policy in 50 years." Keeley also authored the two largest park and environ&#173;mental protection bonds in the state (and nation)'s history. He is a board member of the California Ocean Science Trust and the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation.</p>
<p>In addition, in 2003 the campus established the Keeley Lecture on Environmental Policy. This year former secretary of energy and Nobel prize winner Steven Chu will deliver the lecture Feb. 27 at the Climate Science and Policy Conference.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/news-events/student-profiles/2015/linda-pineda.html</url><title>Profile

Ethnic Studies</strong></em></a> and the <em><strong>Living Writers Series</strong></em> at UC Santa Cruz will present two evening events with visiting Nigerian filmmaker Branwen Okpako, February 10-11.<br/>
<br/>
 A free film screening of the acclaimed feminist director&#8217;s award-winning documentary, <em>The Education of Auma Obama</em>, will take place on Wednesday, February 10, at the Nickelodeon Theatre in downtown Santa Cruz. It begins at 7:30 p.m. and will be followed by a Q&amp;A with the director.<br/>
<br/>
 Okpako will also show clips and discuss her film on campus Thursday, February 11, at the Humanities Lecture Hall as part of the Creative Writing Program&#8217;s <a href="http://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/news-events/living-writers-series/list-page.html"><strong><em>Living Writers Series</em></strong></a>, beginning at 6 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
 Admission is free to both events and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
 <a href="http://www.filmkantine.de/obama/#_welcome"><strong><em>The Education of Auma Obama</em></strong></a> is a feature documentary film on the life and times of Auma Obama--told from her homestead in Kenya during the run up to the 2008 United States Presidential elections that brought her brother Barack Obama to power.<br/>
<br/>
 Released in 2011, the film includes rare footage of a young Barack Obama and his family in Kenya.<br/>
<br/>
 It received numerous awards, including the 2012 African Movie Academy Award for <em>Best Diaspora Documentary</em>, the 2012 Festival Founders&#8217; Award for <em>Best Documentary</em> at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles, and the <em>Viewers Choice Award</em> at the Africa International Film Festival in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
 A review in <em>Variety</em> noted: &#8220;One branch of President Obama's fascinating family tree reveals its own compelling story in Branwen Okpako's &#8216;The Education of Auma Obama.&#8217; Born of the same father but raised by a different mother in the family's Kenyan homeland, Obama's half-sister Auma describes a life of intellectual inquiry and social activism that mirrors the future president's.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okpako currently lives in Berlin, where she continues to make films and also works in theater--writing and directing plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to study film came from a desire to combine all my passions: painting, telling stories and directing actors, all of which I had enjoyed doing since I was very young,&#8221; she recently observed in an interview with the <em>African Women in Cinema</em> blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Storytelling runs in our family,&#8221; she added. &#8220;My father&#8216;s brother Kpeha was a famous poet of Udje. Film seemed to synthesize these loves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okpako&#8217;s most recent project, T<em>he Curse of Medea</em>, a docudrama about the life of the late German writer Christa Wolf, was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2014.</p>

experiences through the lens of classroom learning </article-subhead><article-text><p>The six-month full-time field study has been the heart of the community studies major at UC Santa Cruz since the program began in 1969.</p>
<p>After students return, they present their findings and experiences with a poster that describes the synthesis of field study and classroom-based learning. Last week, 44 students and their posters lined the narrow hallways of the Oakes College Academic Building in the second annual poster session since the major was reinstated nearly three years ago as a program at Oakes.</p>
<p>Students complete the field study during the summer after junior year and the fall quarter of the senior year. Field placements this second year were primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area but were also located in other parts of the nation, with international placements in Guanajuato, Mexico, and Bogota, Colombia. As the longest running interdisciplinary program at UC Santa Cruz, community studies has been a pioneer in experiential education with a focus on social justice.</p>
<p>Students were enthusiastic as they described for classmates, friends, faculty, and other visitors what they saw, accomplished, and learned. Community studies alumni also returned to campus to experience &#8220;Community Studies 2.0,&#8221; as program director associate professor Mary Beth Pudup likes to call the revived program.&#160;</p>
<p>Julia Holl said she enrolled at UC Santa Cruz as a re-entry student before the community studies major was reinstated and eagerly declared the major once it returned. She had previously worked for seven years at the front desk for Ecology Action in Santa Cruz and wanted to return to college to improve job prospects. For her field study, she worked with Environmental Innovations in Scotts Valley on a Monterey Bay community power project.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s already started working as an aide to Assembly member Mark Stone and will go full time when she graduates in five weeks.</p>
<p>Victoria Pozos Bernal interviewed 350 flower workers in Bogota, Colombia for her research report on the flower industry.&#160; The daughter of farm workers from Watsonville worked with Pasos Internacional, the Project for International Accompaniment and Solidarity in Colombia. &#160;At first it was difficult to get the workers to open up about working conditions, she said.</p>
<p>Among other things, workers told her they are informed a week before inspections from fair trade groups and have a chance to clean up and prepare. She also investigated two workers unions and their different strategies for worker protection.</p>
<p>Pozos Bernal was one of two students at the poster session whose field study organization had been founded by an alumnus of the community studies program: Pasos Internacional was started by Nate Miller (class of 2011). Antonella de la Tore worked at Pie Ranch, a food justice organization and working organic farm in San Mateo county founded by Jared Lawson (class of 1992).&#160; &#160;</p>
<p>Two other students were surprised when their respective field studies &#8211; one in Los Angeles the other in Oakland &#8211; landed them on a conference call to work on common issues. Crystal Centeno, a double major in community studies and politics, was working on economics of community development in the Figueroa corridor in L.A. with Esperanza Community Housing. Augusta Alexander was in Oakland with Human Impact Partners, focusing on community health issues.</p>
<p>Centeno said oil wells in the south L.A. area are affecting the environment in neighborhoods where she worked, and also where she grew up in Pico Rivera about 15 miles to the east. She and Alexander ended up collaborating on strategies to improve the health of residents through community organizing and a &#8220;people not wells&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>In San Francisco&#8217;s Tenderloin district Tessa McWalters, a transfer student from Sacramento, helped organize a retail workers bill of rights with a group called Young Workers United. &#160;The campaign is focused on young workers, particularly in the food and service sectors, who typically receive low wages and little job security.</p>
<p>"What makes these poster sessions so great,&#8221; said Pudup, &#8220;is how students return from field study with news of the world.&#160; But they go way beyond reporting about interesting organizations.&#160; Each student interrogates their field study experience through the lenses of classroom learning. It&#8217;s an exciting process.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cca81e94807270177fc3056f9931a3ae"><name>watkins-tony-hill-honoree-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Educator, student advocate to receive Tony Hill Memorial Award</title><summary>Michael Watkins, Santa Cruz County superintendent of schools and a tireless advocate for students, is this year’s winner of the eighth annual Tony Hill Memorial Award. </summary><start-date>1455130800000</start-date><display-name>watkins-mlk-tony-hill-award</display-name><path>/2016/02/watkins-tony-hill-honoree-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/watkins-tony-hill-honoree-2016</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1455132515955</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1455132617593</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/Watkins350jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/Watkins350jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Watkins350jpg</name><display-name>Watkins350jpg</display-name><file-size>25974</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/Watkinsthumbnail80</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/Watkinsthumbnail80</link><site>news</site><name>Watkinsthumbnail80</name><display-name>Watkinsthumbnail80</display-name><file-size>13467</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span>The fact that he knew Tony Hill well makes this award &#8220;all the more precious to me,&#8221; Michael Watkins said.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Michael Watkins, Santa Cruz County superintendent of schools, known for fighting for equity, social and economic justice, and bridge building</article-subhead><article-text><p>Michael Watkins, Santa Cruz County superintendent of schools and a tireless advocate for students, is this year&#8217;s winner of the eighth annual Tony Hill Memorial Award.</p>
<p>Watkins, who has a special place in his heart for special needs students, &#160;will receive the award as part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on February 12 in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>This special honor recognizes individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill&#8217;s work and legacy. Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62. Award recipients receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.</p>
<p>Melanie Stern, Tony Hill's widow and a member of the award selection committee, praised Watkins&#8217;s sincerity, hard work, and commitment.</p>
<p>She first met him in the early 1990s while she was serving as program manager and clinical director for Pajaro Valley Prevention and Student Assistance. She was part of a program for students who felt disenfranchised, at risk for gang involvement or already affiliated, whose needs were not being met in a traditional school setting.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was impressed by Michael&#8217;s calm presence,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;I felt he listened fully to each of us. Michael is an innovator, a big-picture thinker, and at that moment, I experienced his compassion and commitment for young people of color, those young people who did not have access to the resources or support to assist them in becoming healthy and productive citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said Watkins shared Tony Hill&#8217;s &#8220;urgency&#8221; when it came to making a difference in young people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony knew Michael well, and they were similar, both fighting for equity, social and economic justice, and bridge building,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The fact that he knew Tony Hill well makes this award &#8220;all the more precious to me,&#8221; Watkins said.</p>
<p>Watkins&#8217;s work is far-ranging, but the award selection committee is praising him, in particular, for his work with special needs youth and restorative justice, and, in Watkins&#8217;s words, &#8220;trying to level the playing field for those who are a little less fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is also known for his work to increase the number of African Americans in administrative positions in schools. Watkins noted that there are only 28 African American school superintendents in 1,000 schools across the state. He also serves on the five-member California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, charged with improving outcomes in underperforming school districts.</p>
<p>Watkins now lives in Aptos, but he grew up in Oakland. His parents, who moved out of the South to improve their circumstances, were not college educated. He picked up on their strong work ethic, which stuck with him while he was starting his teaching career at a junior high school in Oakland. He gravitated toward special education, and developed a strong respect for fellow teachers who shared his commitment to the students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always gravitated to the ones who are less fortunate,&#8221; Watkins said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked in a children&#8217;s shelter, teaching educationally handicapped or emotionally disturbed students. What prompted me is a strong need. You just can&#8217;t create a special education teacher; it has to be a passion, a calling. I&#8217;ve learned so much from the special needs students. They&#8217;ve taught me, as much as I&#8217;ve taught them, about empathy, humor, and compassion. It was fun going to work because I learned a lot. I learned they really appreciate someone who is caring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watkins plans to donate the $500 stipend to the Special Parents Information Network (SPIN), an organization that works with parents of special needs children to help them overcome challenges.</p>
<p>Past Tony Hill Award honorees include Jacob Martinez, founder of nonprofit Digital NEST; Deutron Kebebew, a former foster child who became a strong advocate for foster children; and the Rev. Deborah Johnson, founding minister and president of Inner Light Ministries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd8b3e91807270177fc3056fa8fe5353"><name>ace-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ACE Program marks 30 years of academic support for STEM students</title><summary>Academic Excellence Program's 30th Anniversary celebration and reunion will be held during Alumni Weekend 2016.</summary><keywords>Academic Excellence Program, ACE Program, Nancy Cox-Konopelski, STEM education</keywords><start-date>1455177600000</start-date><display-name>ACE Program marks 30 years of academic support for STEM students</display-name><path>/2016/02/ace-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/ace-program</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1455147400790</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1455648016654</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/ian-weaver-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/ian-weaver-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ian-weaver-400.jpg</name><display-name>ian-weaver-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77584</file-size><width>400</width><height>309</height></image><image-alt>Ian Weaver at white board</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/sarah-deleon2-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/sarah-deleon2-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sarah-deleon2-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sarah-deleon2-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23554</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sarah Deleon</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Ian Weaver (at white board) works with ACE students in a physics problem-solving session.

Nancy Cox-Konopelski has been with the program for 27 of those 30 years, serving as director for the past 18 years.</p>
<p>"I've seen a lot of students move on to become the leaders that we expect them to become," she said. "Our mission is to increase the diversity of those who choose math- and science-intensive majors, with the hope that the faces of tomorrow's STEM leaders will reflect the faces of our nation as a whole."</p>
<p>Nationally, only 40 percent of students who start college expressing an interest in STEM majors actually graduate with STEM degrees. Students who participate in the ACE program at UC Santa Cruz persist and graduate in their STEM majors at a much better rate. They also earn more A and B grades and fewer non-passing grades in ACE-supported courses than their matched peers.</p>
<p><strong>Group study</strong></p>
<p>At the core of the ACE Program are collaborative problem-solving sessions that supplement the introductory science and math courses so many students struggle with in their freshman and sophomore years. The sessions meet twice a week and provide a group study environment where students learn by working together, with guidance from ACE professional and student staff members. &#160;</p>
<p>"ACE staff make sure to challenge students academically. They want you to excel, and if you're willing to put the work into the class, you will do well," said Sarah Deleon, a sophomore biochemistry and molecular biology major who has been in the ACE program since her freshman year and joined the student staff in September.</p>
<p>In addition to helping students with their courses, the ACE Program develops students' study skills and communication skills, builds their self-confidence, and provides guidance on academic and career planning. According to Deleon and other students, the program's friendly and supportive environment is a key to its success. "It's a very supportive community, and you form long-lasting friendships," Deleon said.</p>
<p>Ian Weaver learned about ACE through his involvement in the National Society of Black Engineers, joined the program his freshman year, and has been on the student staff since he was a sophomore. He said the program provides a nurturing environment with a built-in peer group and mentors who are available to talk any time. The benefits go beyond the tangible resources and course support, Weaver said.</p>
<p>"It's a place where you can talk to other people about your passions and your goals in life. You can say those things out loud, and it makes them more real and gives you confidence," he said. A senior physics major with a concentration in astrophysics, Weaver is now fielding offers from astrophysics graduate programs--so far he has been accepted at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, UC Berkeley, and the University of Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;ACE impact</strong></p>
<p>The ACE Program aims to serve students from groups that have not traditionally pursued degrees in STEM fields. Enrollment priority is given to students eligible for Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP), including first-generation students (first in their family to attend college) and students from low-performing high schools or low-income backgrounds.</p>
<p>ACE students not only earn better grades than their matched peers, they also show higher rates of persistence to degree than non-ACE students. Among students who started their freshman year at UCSC intending to major in biological sciences between 2002 and 2008, first-generation ACE students declared a biology major and graduated with a biology degree at higher rates than students not in the ACE program, whether first-generation or not.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, said the ACE Program reaches only a fraction of the STEM students who could potentially benefit. "We need more resources so that we can reach more students," he said.</p>
<p>The program served nearly 700 students last year, with up to 30 paid student staff members and four professional staff members (all former ACE students and student staffers).</p>
<p>"The campus has made it a priority to fund us all these years. Even in the leanest budget years we were never cut," Cox-Konopelski said. "I'm very proud of this campus for that. But the fact that we're an established program makes the federal funding agencies less interested, so we need to raise private funding to continue to serve more students."</p>
<p>Support for the program comes from a variety of sources, including NSF grants to faculty; Julie Packard, through the Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences; Joe Konopelski and Nancy Cox-Konopelski; the Mervyn L. Brenner Foundation; and gifts from UCSC alumni and past and present ACE students and their families.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, April 30, during <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/">Alumni Weekend 2016</a>, the ACE Program will hold a <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3418">30th Anniversary Celebration</a>. ACE alumni and their family and friends are invited to meet at the Engineering Courtyard behind the Jack Baskin Engineering Building for an ACE Open House.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ace.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Academic Excellence Program</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/</url><title>STEM Diversity Programs</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d152e03b807270177fc3056f586f531d"><name>community-bulletin-kidnap-attempt</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin – Santa Cruz Police Department seeking assistance</title><summary>The Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community's help in identifying the suspect wanted in a child luring case.</summary><start-date>1455177600000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin – Santa Cruz Police Department seeking assistance</display-name><path>/2016/02/community-bulletin-kidnap-attempt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/community-bulletin-kidnap-attempt</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1455210815499</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1455220320694</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/24963160465_c4f53456e9_m.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/24963160465_c4f53456e9_m.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>24963160465_c4f53456e9_m.jpg</name><display-name>24963160465_c4f53456e9_m.jpg</display-name><file-size>13728</file-size><width>192</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>The suspect is described as a 5-foot, 6-inch tall Hispanic male with yellowish teeth.</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/vehicle.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/vehicle.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vehicle.jpg</name><display-name>vehicle.jpg</display-name><file-size>22947</file-size><width>279</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt>The suspect fled the area in a light gold four-door sedan with faded paint.</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community's help in identifying the suspect wanted in a child luring case.

UCSC&#8217;s growing reputation for successfully preparing undergraduate students for the next phase in their lives is due to the incredible work of the entire campus community.</p>
<p>As they do every year, newly admitted undergraduate students will engage with the campus in person and online as they make their decision where to attend in the fall. To support admitted students and their families in their university decision-making process, the Office of Admissions offers the following to learn more about the campus:</p>
<p><strong>UCSC Spring Spotlight &#8211; April 1 to April 9, excluding April 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>(includes specific sessions for transfer students April 8 and 9)</strong></p>
<p>This annual event provides an opportunity for admitted students and their families to visit the campus and learn more about how UC Santa Cruz might be a good fit.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight Monday &#8211; Select Mondays in April and May (online events)</strong></p>
<p>This year the Office of Admissions will be hosting targeted virtual events for frosh and transfers on each Monday throughout April and May. These 1-hour video chat events will focus on different topics, and are designed to meet the needs of students from California and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Campus tours &#8211; Mondays-Fridays, year-round</strong></p>
<p>Students can schedule a student-led tour by using the online reservation tool.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual campus tour</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can experience a campus tour using the virtual tour, available on the Admissions web site, <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu">admissions.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Admissions is also continuing to partner with <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/sio/index.html">student-initiated outreach efforts</a>; student organizations play an important role in reaching out to admitted students and welcoming them to the campus. The Taking UCSC Home program also continues again this year, allowing currently enrolled students to go back to their high schools or community colleges and speak first-hand about their UCSC experience.</p>
<p>We expect over 7,000 visitors in the next couple of months, including many who will travel from another state or another country, and will be curious about academic opportunities and university life. Some of our guests may ask you questions as they tour the campus, and your helpfulness (and patience) will affirm the positive qualities and character of the UCSC community. And when you happen upon individuals or groups that seem lost, I'd appreciate your help in pointing them in the right direction.</p>
<p>We'll begin notifying students of their admission beginning March 15, but in the meantime, if you have questions about these efforts, or if you see areas around campus that need attention, please contact Assistant Director Beatrice Atkinson-Myers in Admissions (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:beatrice@ucsc.edu">beatrice@ucsc.edu</a> or 459-2352) and she will work with the appropriate unit(s) to help create the best possible experience for our visitors. For more information, a complete outline of <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/yield.html">campus spring yield events</a> is available online.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your commitment and continued partnership in yielding the best students for this fall's incoming class!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Michael McCawley, Director of Admissions</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d79c1f98807270177fc3056f58f8291a"><name>lipson-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CASFS researcher Mark Lipson wins sustainability champion award</title><summary>The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) has given its “Sustainability Champion” award to UC Santa Cruz alumnus Mark Lipson, currently a researcher with UCSC’s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</summary><start-date>1455316200000</start-date><display-name>Mark Lipson, Sustainability Champion</display-name><path>/2016/02/lipson-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/lipson-award</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1455316279147</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1455322121079</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/lipson-mark-mdw-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/lipson-mark-mdw-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lipson-mark-mdw-400.jpg</name><display-name>lipson-mark-mdw-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>180460</file-size><width>400</width><height>534</height></image><image-alt>Mark Lipson</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</name><display-name>lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20943</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Mark LIpson</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz alumnus and current CASFS researcher Mark Lipson was honored for his years of service to the organic and sustainable agriculture movement. (Photo by Melissa De Witte)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) has given its &#8220;Sustainability Champion&#8221; award to UC Santa Cruz alumnus Mark Lipson, currently a researcher with UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</a></p>
<p>Lipson (Merrill, &#8216;81, environmental studies) served as organic and sustainable agriculture policy advisor for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture until last year when he joined CASFS as a research associate.&#160; NSAC said the award, given at its annual meeting in Davis, was made to honor Lipson&#8217;s years of service to the organic and sustainable agriculture movement, and his &#8220;groundbreaking work on Capitol Hill shepherding historic changes, such as the much-celebrated five-fold increase in funding for organic research secured in the 2008 Farm Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark is a magnificent pioneer, forging a path for organic agriculture to be a more fully respected force within the U.S. Department of Agriculture,&#8221; said Ferd Hoefner, policy director at NSAC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark Lipson has worn many hats over the years: farmer, activist, USDA employee. Through it all, from Santa Cruz to Capitol Hill and back, he has remained a champion of and thought leader for the organic farming movement,&#8221; said Brise Tencer, executive director, Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF).</p>
<p>Lipson has been a partner at the Davenport-based Molino Creek Farming Collective for the last 30 years. During much of that time he has also had a second career off the farm, working on state and federal policy for organic agriculture. He started his advocacy career as the first paid staff member at the California Certified Organic Farmers (now the nation&#8217;s largest certification organization), later he worked as the policy director at the Organic Farming Research Foundation, and eventually made his way to the USDA, where he helped lead the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative and chaired the agency&#8217;s organic working group from 2010-2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tendency in movements is to be provincial, to only understand the part of the elephant that you&#8217;re standing next to,&#8221; Lipson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working with the Agroecology Center at UCSC is me coming full circle,&#8221; said Lipson. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to integrate policy components, and that kind of understanding and training, into the great work the center is already doing, because there&#8217;s a lot of different ways to be an active stakeholder. We need to make a better bridge between the grassroots, the implementers in the agencies, and the legislators. Part of that is projecting ourselves and parts of our movement into new roles within the larger policy structure&#8211;we need to be prepared, credible, and willing to do those tours of duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition is a grassroots alliance that advocates for federal policy reform supporting the long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability of agriculture, natural resources, and rural communities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sustainableagriculture.net</url><title>National

Future of Memory,</strong> on campus February 23, at the Humanities 1 Building.<br/>
 <br/>
 The conference will address the complexity of the Ghetto of Venice as it marks its 500th anniversary--both as an actual physical space and as a global metaphor--tracing its path and significance across space and time.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The Venice Ghetto represents the first instance of the word &#8220;ghetto&#8221; being used in the world, and it has come to mean spaces of segregation,&#8221; noted Katie Trostel, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student in literature, who is coordinating the conference. &#8220;That all stems from the Jewish term in Venice.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Ghetto is an Italian word that means foundry,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It refers to the space in which Jews were forced to live in, beginning in 1516. It was actually the site of an abandoned metal foundry.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Presenters at the conference will bring together representations of the ghetto in art, literature, and photography and discuss the archival possibilities of digital technology. By thinking of the ghetto as a &#8220;memory space that travels,&#8221; as opposed to a museum-like site, the goal is to create new representations of the ghetto that will resonate with people in the 21st century.<br/>
 <br/>
 Trostel&#8217;s own presentation at the conference will be a Skype conversation with acclaimed Chilean poet and human rights activist Marjorie Agosin. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;She explains in prose poems all the places in history where her family has been exiled from, or set apart from the larger population,&#8221; said Trostel. &#8220;She goes to four different continents to explore Jewish space that has touched her life. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Central to her book <em>Cartographies: Meditations on Travel</em>, is a visit to the Venice Ghetto. Through Skype she is going to read her poem about Venice and then I will interview her on what the significance of space is to her.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;One of the things I&#8217;m working on is a digital map of her poem,&#8221; Trostel added. &#8220;Using Google Map technology, I can go to different places she visits in the poems. And so we will have clips of me interviewing her about the various places in this poem.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The conference will also include a panel on the ghetto as theater, and another on digital mapping projects, such as historic Jewish spaces in Morocco which no longer exist. <br/>
 <br/>
 The final panel, titled &#8220;The Venice Ghetto at 500,&#8221; will be a roundtable discussion moderated by UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of literature Murray Baumgarten. <br/>
 <br/>
 Those panelists will include UCSC digital humanities specialist Rachel Deblinger, history lecturer Bruce Thompson, emeritus professor of history Peter Kenez, and history professor Nathaniel Deutsch, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute for Humanities Research. <br/>
 <br/>
 Baumgarten is also slated to give a talk titled &#8220;Venice, the Ghetto, and the Jews, 1516-2016: A Tale of Money and Moxie,&#8221; at the opening of an art exhibition in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www.jewishlearningworks.org/jewish-community-library/"><em><strong>Jewish Community Library</strong></em></a> in conjunction with the <a href="http://museoitaloamericano.org"><em><strong>Museo Italo Americano</strong></em></a>, on March 29.<br/>

href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520278806"><em>Ecosystems of California</em></a> (University of California Press, 2016) is a new comprehensive reference of California&#8217;s ecological abundance featuring contributions from 149 experts including 19 with ties to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Co-edited by Erika Zavaleta, Pepper-Giberson&#160;Chair in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz and Harold Mooney, Paul S. and Billie Achilles Professor in Environmental Biology, emeritus, Stanford University, the book examines California&#8217;s unique ecosystems through the lenses of past, present, and future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about where we&#8217;ve come from and how things got to be the way they are,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Textbook she wanted</strong></p>
<p>This is the textbook Zavaleta wished she had when she was a Stanford undergraduate more than 20 years ago in her first biology class, Mooney's&#160; &#8220;Ecosystems of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>An outdoor enthusiast then as now, Zavaleta said the class included a lot of fieldwork and &#8220;really piqued my interest. I saw how much was out there, the diversity of California and how it evolved. It was all new to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavaleta and Mooney, later her Ph.D. advisor, first talked about a book project in 2005.&#160; &#8220;We felt like there wasn&#8217;t a book that looked systematically at the history, dynamics, and the conservation of California ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first we thought it would be 20 chapters and we&#8217;d write it ourselves,&#8221; Zavaleta recalled. &#8220;It quickly became apparent it would be 40 chapters and no way we could do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result is 41 chapters and more than 1,000 pages, covering the biologically diverse state from ocean to mountaintops, flora and fauna, aquatic and terrestrial, natural and managed. Each chapter evaluates natural processes for a specific ecosystem, describes drivers of change, and discusses how that ecosystem may be altered in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Three audiences</strong></p>
<p>Zavaleta said the book is meant for three audiences: researchers; managers, policy makers and land stewards; and students. To both promote it but more importantly help make known its findings, the editors and some contributors are embarking on a series of private and public events. Zavaleta, Mooney, and others including Mark Carr, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, are planning to visit Sacramento Wed. Feb. 17 to brief state officials in the governor&#8217;s office and Office of Natural Resources. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>California Academy of Sciences symposium</strong></p>
<p>The next afternoon, the California Academy of Science in San Francisco will hold a symposium on the book with Zavaleta, Mooney, and other authors. The symposium is already sold out. Future events are being planned for Stanford and Southern California.</p>
<p>Zavaleta&#8217;s research bridges ecological theory with conservation and management practice.&#160; She joined UC Santa Cruz in 2003 and holds, bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford. She received the 2008 Sustainability Science Award from the Ecological Society of America</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in exciting times,&#8221; Zavaleta writes in a blog about the new book. &#8220;California, as the rest of the world, faces accelerating change on every front. The happy news is that much of this ongoing change is also for good: leaving behind the long legacy of DDT and the nadir of our state&#8217;s air and water quality, discovering new restoration tools and conservation partnerships, innovating policy responses to climate change, recovering long-lost species, forging sustainable paths in forestry and fisheries management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hal Mooney and I envisioned <em>Ecosystems of California</em> to&#160;tackle&#160;a simple question: what do we know about the trajectory of this globally significant region&#8217;s ecology, from the deep past into the next 100 years,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Garza, who gave the keynote address at the 32<sup>nd</sup> annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on February 12, is more than just a dynamic speaker. She is also a key figure in an international civil rights movement and a charismatic leader whose remarks often left the audience rapt and quiet&#8212;with the exception of one boisterous shouter who briefly interrupted the proceedings until Garza deftly incorporated his outburst into her remarks.</p>
<p>The shouter insisted that people are born into racism, to which Garza responded that racism is taught, and that human beings are not born with such hate.</p>
<p>Garza put a strong emphasis on painful truths and prejudice, but she leavened her remarks every so often with her rueful and infectious laugh, which brought roars of applause from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>A love note to black people</strong></p>
<p>Black Lives Matter describes itself, in its website, as &#8220;a unique contribution that goes beyond (drawing attention to) extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes &#8230; Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements.&#160; It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement."</p>
<p>Garza will go down in history not only as a cofounder of the movement but as the person who coined the hashtag &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white man who gunned down an unarmed black youth, Trayvon Martin. A signature sign-off turned into a movement name; Garza&#8212;along with Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors&#8212;began to use #BlackLivesMatter as a Twitter hashtag. The result was a grassroots activist movement that soon went nationwide.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;When we heard [Zimmerman] was acquitted, it was like we had been punched in the gut &#8230; Trayvon could have been my brother,&#8217;&#8217; Garza told <em>USA Today</em> in an interview. &#8220;I started writing a love note to black people (on social media.)&#8221; That note was a proclamation of love and solidarity and also a response to the &#8220;sick disease&#8221; of systemic racism.</p>
<p>Garza elaborated on that love letter in great detail during her Santa Cruz appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote that letter because too many people who have been sworn to serve and protect us are literally getting away with murder,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;I wrote that letter because too many of us are living in housing that is badly deteriorating or have no housing at all. I wrote that letter because too many of us are not living past the age of 35. I wrote that letter because too many mothers are losing their children. I wrote that letter because I believe it is OK to be angry. I wrote that letter for every time someone hugged her purse tighter when I walked by. I wrote that letter because I will not be blamed for systems I did not create.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>'Inhuman system'</strong></p>
<p>Several times, she referred to the words of Martin Luther King Jr., but she urged the crowd to understand the context of King&#8217;s message of nonviolent resistance not as a form of passivity in the face of cruelty, but a strategy to expose the immorality of &#8220;the inhuman system&#8221; of racism ... We should not be lulled into an ahistorical retelling of what Dr. King fought for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garza continued: &#8220;As someone who is part of a movement that gets called violent, I have a hard time when we reflect on the legacy of freedom fighters who have come before us, and we sit in this comfortable chair of nonviolence without situating it in a context: a strategy to raise the moral question of racism, meaning can&#8217;t we show that racism is an inhuman system? Can&#8217;t we demonstrate to the world that the violence exacted against black communities is inhumane, unnecessary, and eating away at the soul of this nation?"</p>
<p>"Certainly we should be clear that we should not mistake nonviolence for passivity in the face of oppression, we should not mistake nonviolence for peace, and we should not use nonviolence as a way to ask us to be patient, to not rock the boat, to wait until change comes."</p>
<p>She spoke of King&#8217;s words and actions as a means to bring out the ugliness of racism &#8220;into the air and light&#8221; where it cannot survive, and the act of exposing this evil &#8220;to the light of human consciousness.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeking the same goals, yet we must acknowledge that the work [of King] is unfinished,&#8221; Garza said.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Hill Award</strong></p>
<p>Another highlight of the evening was a ceremony to honor this year&#8217;s recipient of the Tony Hill Award. The award went to Michael Watkins, the first elected African American county superintendent of schools in California, as well as a tireless advocate for students, noted for his work with young people who have special needs.</p>
<p>This special honor recognizes individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill&#8217;s work and legacy. Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62. Award recipients receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.</p>
<p>Melanie Stern, Tony Hill's widow and a member of the award selection committee, praised Watkins&#8217;s sincerity, hard work, and commitment.</p>
<p>Though he has had a long and illustrious career, Watkins reflected back on the time when he was unproven and just starting out, a young man brimming with ambition and idealism.</p>

He was 85.</p>
<p>Edgar made significant contributions in two areas of molecular biology--the genetics and self-assembly of viruses and the genetics of a tiny worm, the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans,</em> which Edgar helped establish as one of the most useful model organisms for biological research. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Edgar earned his bachelor's degree at McGill University in Montreal and Ph.D. in biology at the University of Rochester. As a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, he did pioneering research in molecular biology, studying a virus that infects bacteria (known as bacteriophage T4). He received the Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences for this work in 1965.</p>
<p>In 1970, Edgar came to UC Santa Cruz as founding provost of Kresge College. His primary focus initially was on undergraduate education and the establishment of the new college. But he also continued his research, and he became interested in <em>C. elegans</em> as a model system for studying developmental biology. He played a leading role in the community of researchers studying this important organism.</p>
<p>Edgar also had a role in the beginnings of the Human Genome Project as a key participant in the 1985 workshop organized by Robert Sinsheimer, then chancellor of UCSC, to explore the feasibility of sequencing the human genome. The Santa Cruz workshop planted the seed for what later became the International Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>Edgar is survived by his partner of 40 years, Carol Proudfoot-Edgar; his two sons, Bruce and Chris Edgar; and two grandsons, Nico and Noah.</p>

<p>The finding comes in &#8220;<a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/gmp/docs/resources/swrcb_012816.pdf">An Evaluation of California&#8217;s Adjudicated Groundwater Basins</a>&#8221; scheduled for release today (Feb. 18).</p>
<p>The board contracted with Ruth Langridge, a UC Santa Cruz researcher with the <a href="http://cgirs.ucsc.edu/">Center for Global, International and Regional Studies</a>, to review the history, development, overall condition and current management practices for all of California&#8217;s court-adjudicated groundwater basins.</p>
<p>The research team that created the report also includes UC Santa Cruz sociology Ph.D. students Abigail Brown and Kirsten Rudestam, and Esther Conrad, a recent Ph.D. graduate of UC Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>Critical resource</strong></p>
<p>Groundwater is a critical resource in California, providing on average 30 percent of the state&#8217;s total water supply and significantly more during dry years. The report and its conclusions are significant as the state water board considers management plans for groundwater supplies depleted after decades of pumping and four years of drought. Land in some Central Valley regions has sunk because of groundwater depletion. In other areas closer to the coast, salt water has intruded as fresh water is pumped from groundwater basins.</p>
<p>The issue is also significant as water agencies increasing look to import water to supplement depleted supply. &#8220;It is at the forefront because imported water is becoming more scarce and more expensive,&#8221; Langridge said.</p>
<p>In 2014, the state&#8217;s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) established new requirements to develop sustainable management plans with state oversight for 127 high- and medium-priority groundwater basins that are either in overdraft or vulnerable to overdraft.</p>
<p><strong>Adjudicated basins exempted</strong></p>
<p>It exempted all &#8220;adjudicated&#8221; basins in the state along with three others with pending groundwater adjudications, and 388 basins categorized as low- and very-low priority.</p>
<p>In a groundwater adjudication, a court defines and determines water rights for all water users in the basin and provides court-supervised basin management by a &#8220;watermaster,&#8221; usually someone appointed by the court to ensure that the basin is managed in accordance with the court&#8217;s decree.</p>
<p>Langridge said the adjudicated basins her team studied encompass most of the major Southern California urban areas as well as important Central Coast areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the state's concern over its groundwater resources, there is very limited research on these basins and almost nothing over the past several decades,&#8221; Langridge said.</p>
<p>Langridge said adjudication is primarily about the needs and interests of individual parties, as opposed to focusing on overall sustainable management of the basin. She and her team found that declining groundwater levels and associated impacts were a primary problem leading to adjudication, but not the only problem.</p>
<p>Groundwater pumping is generally based on past practices, and there is a major reliance on imported water without consideration of the impacts of climate change, the team found. Significantly, Langridge said, small users and disadvantaged communities are rarely included. Safe yield is neither calculated nor used in some basins and accumulated overdraft is rarely addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The report recommends requirements for the sustainable management of adjudicated groundwater basins, including a watermaster and required annual reports, clear definitions and specifications of safe yield and overdraft, procedures to reduce pumping, strategies to reduce accumulated overdraft, and trigger points to spur further action.</p>
<p>Langridge&#8217;s research focuses on the processes and relations that enable access to water and create resilience to water scarcity; the legal and institutional issues related to water supply planning and groundwater management; and water supply security under climate change. She recently completed a three-year term as a member of the California Department of Water Resources Climate Change Technical Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Langridge said the data she and her colleagues collected over the past nine months will now allow further analysis of California&#8217;s precarious water future.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/gmp/docs/resources/swrcb_012816.pdf</url><title>An Evaluation of California’s Adjudicated Groundwater Basins</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/</url><title>State Water Resources Control Board</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cgirs.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Center for Global, International &amp; Regional Studies</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucwater.org/</url><title>UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f5362020807270177fc3056f02e2fc32"><name>wfirst-expo</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers plan science projects for powerful new space telescope</title><summary>UCSC astronomers are involved in planning for WFIRST, a powerful new space telescope now under development by NASA.</summary><keywords>WFIRST, Brant Robertson</keywords><start-date>1455782400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers plan science projects for powerful new space telescope</display-name><path>/2016/02/wfirst-expo</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/wfirst-expo</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1455812905957</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1456355850143</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LbJpVHMV1m4" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption>The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will image large regions of the sky in near-infrared light to answer fundamental questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and greatly expand our knowledge of planetary systems around other stars.

<p>NASA announced the formal start of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission on February 18. Planned as the agency's next major astrophysics observatory following the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, WFIRST will survey large regions of the sky in near-infrared light to answer fundamental questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and to expand our knowledge of planetary systems around other stars.</p>
<p>Brant Robertson, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, leads the WFIRST Extragalactic Potential Observations (EXPO) Science Investigation Team, which will identify the most pressing and scientifically compelling projects for WFIRST beyond the primary survey projects already planned for the telescope.</p>
<p>"There will be a huge amount of data from the surveys, and part of our job is to think about how we can make that data most useful for general astronomers in order to optimize the science payoffs," Robertson said. "We are also helping to evaluate the design of the telescope, running simulations of how it will work and analyzing simulated images."</p>
<p><strong>Wide Field Instrument</strong></p>
<p>WFIRST incorporates components from an existing telescope NASA acquired from another agency in 2012, including a 2.4-meter mirror of identical size and quality to the one used by the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope's Wide Field Instrument will give it the ability to capture a single image with the depth and quality of Hubble but covering 100 times Hubble's field of view. WFIRST will also carry a Coronagraph Instrument designed to block the glare of individual stars and reveal the faint light of planets orbiting around them.</p>
<p>"The design work is already well advanced, and it is a really impressive telescope," Robertson said. "Its camera is about 200 times larger than Hubble's, and this capability will enable astronomers around the world to use WFIRST to explore the deepest reaches of space over an area thousands of times larger than the size of the moon on the sky."</p>
<p>Guest investigators will be able to conduct their own investigations using data from the surveys, while guest observers can propose additional survey projects for the telescope. The WFIRST-EXPO team will evaluate guest investigator and guest observer projects to help maximize the scientific return of the WFIRST cosmological surveys and realize the full power of the telescope for extragalactic astronomy. The team, one of a dozen WFIRST science investigation teams, will receive $2.3 million to perform these studies over the next five years.</p>
<p>Robertson leads the team of 11 astronomers, including world-wide experts in designing and executing space-based extragalactic survey programs, multi-object spectroscopic campaigns in optical and infrared wavelengths, and theoretical modeling of galaxy formation, exotic supernovae, and cosmic reionization. They include Piero Madau and Stan Woosley at UC Santa Cruz; Dan Marrone and Daniel Stark at the University of Arizona; Risa Wechsler at Stanford University; Jenny Greene at Princeton University; Steven Furlanetto and Alice Shapley at UCLA; Henry Ferguson at the Space Science Telescope Institute; and Mark Dickinson at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy.</p>
<p>In addition to surveys of deep space beyond our galaxy, WFIRST's sensitivity and wide field of view will enable a large-scale search for exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of millions of stars in the crowded central region of our galaxy. The survey will net thousands of new exoplanets, complementing the work started by NASA's Kepler mission and the upcoming work of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.</p>
<p>Other wide-field surveys will enable astronomers to track how dark energy and dark matter have affected the expansion of the universe over the past 10 billion years or more. By measuring the distances to thousands of supernovae, astronomers can map in detail how cosmic expansion has increased with time. WFIRST can also precisely measure the shapes, positions and distances of millions of galaxies to track the distribution and growth of cosmic structures.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Coronagraph</strong></p>
<p>The Coronagraph Instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres. Comparing this data across many worlds will allow scientists to better understand the origin and physics of their atmospheres and to search for chemical signs of environments suitable for life.</p>
<p>"In addition to its exciting capabilities for dark energy and exoplanets, WFIRST will provide a treasure trove of exquisite data for all astronomers," said Neil Gehrels, the WFIRST Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "This mission will survey the universe to find the most interesting objects out there."</p>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), planned to launch in 2018, will see deeper into space and further back in time than WFIRST. With its larger mirror, JWST will be able to observe much fainter galaxies, but its field of view is much smaller. "JWST will conduct very deep observations of a small area, while WFIRST will cover large areas at the same depth as Hubble," Robertson said. "If they overlap and JWST is still operational when WFIRST launches, it will be a very powerful combination."</p>
<p>WFIRST is slated to launch in the mid-2020s. The project is managed at Goddard, with participation by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) in Pasadena, and a science team with members from U.S. research institutions across the country.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/wfirst</url><title>WFIRST Infrared Telescope</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fb14ac8c807270177fc3056f6031602e"><name>graphene-supercapacitor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers use 3D printing to make ultrafast graphene supercapacitor</title><summary>Supercapacitor advances could lead to highly efficient energy storage systems for smartphones and other devices</summary><keywords>graphene aerogel electrodes, supercapacitors, Yat Li</keywords><start-date>1455868800000</start-date><display-name>Researchers use 3D printing to make ultrafast graphene supercapacitor</display-name><path>/2016/02/graphene-supercapacitor</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/graphene-supercapacitor</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1455911382124</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1455911647775</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/li-liu-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/li-liu-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>li-liu-400.jpg</name><display-name>li-liu-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>117227</file-size><width>400</width><height>436</height></image><image-alt>researchers in lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/li-liu-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/li-liu-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>li-liu-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>li-liu-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21917</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researchers in lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Yat Li (left) and Tianyu Liu worked with researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to develop supercapacitors using 3D-printed graphene aerogel electrodes.

<p>"Supercapacitor devices using our 3D-printed graphene electrodes with thicknesses on the order of millimeters exhibit outstanding capacitance retention and power densities," said corresponding author Yat Li, associate professor of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz. "This performance greatly exceeds the performance of conventional devices with thick electrodes, and it equals or exceeds the performance of reported devices made with electrodes 10 to 100 times thinner."</p>
<p>LLNL engineer Cheng Zhu and UCSC graduate student Tianyu Liu are lead authors of the paper. "This breaks through the limitations of what 2D manufacturing can do," Zhu said. "We can fabricate a large range of 3D architectures. In a phone, for instance, you would only need to leave a small area for energy storage. The geometry can be very complex."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Fast charging</strong></p>
<p>Supercapacitors also can charge incredibly fast, Zhu said, in theory requiring just a few minutes or seconds to reach full capacity. In the future, the researchers believe newly designed 3D-printed supercapacitors will be used to create unique electronics that are currently difficult or even impossible to make using other synthetic methods, including fully customized smartphones and paper-based or foldable devices, while at the same time achieving unprecedented levels of performance.</p>
<p>According to Li, several key breakthroughs made these novel devices possible, starting with the development of a printable graphene-based ink. Modification of the 3D printing scheme to be compatible with aerogel processing made it possible to maintain the important mechanical and electrical properties of single graphene sheets in the 3D-printed structures. Finally, the use of 3D printing to intelligently engineer periodic macropores into the graphene electrode significantly enhances mass transport, allowing the device to support much faster charge/discharge rates without degrading its capacity.</p>
<p>"This work provides an example of how 3D-printed materials such as graphene aerogels can significantly expand the design space for fabricating high-performance and fully integrable energy storage devices optimized for a broad range of applications," Li said.</p>
<p>The advantages of graphene-based inks include their ultrahigh surface area, lightweight properties, elasticity, and superior electrical conductivity. The graphene composite aerogel supercapacitors are also extremely stable, the researchers reported, capable of nearly fully retaining their energy capacity after 10,000 consecutive charging and discharging cycles.</p>
<p>"Graphene is a really incredible material because it is essentially a single atomic layer that can be created from graphite. Because of its structure and crystalline arrangement, it has really phenomenal capabilities," said LLNL materials engineer Eric Duoss.</p>
<p>Over the next year, the researchers intend to expand the technology by developing new 3D designs, using different inks, and improving the performance of existing materials.</p>

Sloan Foundation has awarded Sloan Research Fellowships to two UC Santa Cruz scientists: Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Awarded annually since 1955, the Sloan Research Fellowships are given to early-career scientists and scholars whose achievements and potential identify them as rising stars, the next generation of scientific leaders. Fellows receive $55,000 to further their research.</p>
<p>Skemer specializes in direct imaging of extrasolar planets, developing new astronomical instruments and observational techniques to improve the ability of astronomers to see and study very faint planets near their bright host stars. As a Hubble Fellow at the University of Arizona, he built an innovative spectrograph (Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Survey, or ALES) for the Large Binocular Telescope, and he is now using it to obtain spectra of all currently known directly imaged exoplanets. A spectrograph spreads out the light from an object into a spectrum of different wavelengths, which can yield clues to the physical properties of a planet.</p>
<p>"My goal is not just to find exoplanets but to characterize them," Skemer said. "I want to start understanding exoplanets in the same way we understand the planets in our own solar system."</p>
<p>Kroeker's research focuses on the effects of environmental change in dynamic and complex coastal ecosystems. Carbon dioxide emissions are driving unprecedented environmental changes, including climate change and ocean acidification. Kroeker has done notable work on the ecological effects of ocean acidification, and she notes that most ecosystems face a whole range of stressors, from warming to overfishing. She plans to conduct large-scale studies of seagrass and kelp forest ecosystems, looking at multiple environmental drivers and their effects on species interactions and ecosystem function.</p>
<p>"My research suggests non-linear interactions among multiple stressors are very common, and these interactions could cause ecological surprises in the vulnerability of marine species and communities to environmental change," Kroeker said. "I want to improve our ability to forecast and manage the emergent effects of environmental change in nearshore ecosystems."</p>
<p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close coordination with the scientific community. Candidates must be nominated by their fellow scientists, and winners are selected by an independent panel of senior scholars. The fellowships are awarded in chemistry, computer science, economics, mathematics, computational and evolutionary molecular biology, neuroscience, ocean sciences, and physics.</p>

<p>Forsberg's research interests encompass stem cells, blood cell development, genomics, and more. Her laboratory studies hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for generating a life-long supply of mature blood cells. These stem cells give rise to all of the different types of mature blood cells, and Forsberg is working to understand how this process is regulated in order to prevent and treat both genetic and acquired disorders of the hematopoietic system, including anemia, autoimmune disease, leukemias, and lymphomas.</p>
<p>Nominations for the PECASE awards are made by government agencies and departments to recognize scientists and engineers whose early accomplishments show the greatest promise for assuring the country's preeminence in science and engineering and contributing to the awarding agencies' missions. This year, 105 scientists and engineers earned the awards, including 14 UC researchers.</p>
<p>The winners will receive their awards at a Washington, D.C., ceremony this spring. The awards, established by President Clinton in 1996, are coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the President. Awardees are selected for their pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and their commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, or community outreach.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/18/president-obama-honors-extraordinary-early-career-scientists</url><title>White House announcement</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://forsberglab.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Camilla Forsberg Labs</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1029df4980727017266c9f81de0154b8"><name>marbled-murrelets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Autonomous acoustic sensors help researchers find endangered seabirds</title><summary>Technology to detect and record bird calls may be more cost-effective than surveys by field biologists.</summary><keywords>marbled murrelets, Abe Borker, Donald Croll, Bernie Tershy</keywords><start-date>1456329600000</start-date><display-name>Autonomous acoustic sensors help researchers find endangered seabirds</display-name><path>/2016/02/marbled-murrelets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/marbled-murrelets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1456265083321</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1456766744059</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Brendan Bane</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/mckown-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/mckown-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mckown-400.jpg</name><display-name>mckown-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>165071</file-size><width>400</width><height>431</height></image><image-alt>researcher deploying sensor in woods</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/mckown-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/mckown-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mckown-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mckown-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25361</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher deploying sensor in woods</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Researcher Matthew McKown deployed an acoustic sensor to record calls of marbled murrelets.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Using technology to detect and record bird calls could be more cost-effective than surveys by field biologists for monitoring marbled murrelet nesting sites</article-subhead><article-text><p>Marbled murrelets are so secretive that biologists didn't even know where they nested until the 1970s, and monitoring the populations of these endangered seabirds remains a challenge. A new study, however, suggests that autonomous acoustic sensors used to detect and record murrelet calls could offer a viable alternative to surveys conducted by field biologists.</p>
<p>In comparison to the traditional surveys used to find the shy birds, the new technology could enable scientists to conduct broader, more cost-effective searches, according to UC Santa Cruz graduate student Abraham Borker, first author of a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.608/full">paper on the new findings</a> published in <em>Wildlife Society Bulletin.</em></p>
<p>Marbled murrelets are the odd ducks of seabirds. For most of the year, they sport typical marine bird plumage, dark on top and light on bottom to conceal them from predators above and below. But when breeding season nears, they turn a mottled ashy brown, which blends well with the coastal old-growth redwood forests where they nest. Murrelets sometimes fly up to 50 miles inland to nest, laying a single egg on a bed of moss high in a large tree.</p>
<p><strong>Old-growth forests</strong></p>
<p>No one formally described a marbled murrelet nest until 1974, when an unsuspecting arborist stumbled across a chick at the top of an old-growth Douglas fir. Their population has since declined along with the old-growth forests they depend on. Today, much of their nesting habitat has been logged, and marbled murrelet populations in Oregon, Washington, and California are considered endangered.</p>
<p>Scientists are trying to assist the murrelet's recovery by relieving pressure from nest predators and protecting old-growth forests. But to know if those efforts are working, said Borker, researchers need to assess how murrelet populations are responding.</p>
<p>"We need measurements to judge whether our conservation efforts are successful," said coauthor Donald Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. "But that can take a long time, it's hard to get enough samples, and it can be difficult to do."</p>
<p><strong>Acoustic sensors</strong></p>
<p>To streamline the surveys, Borker and colleagues turned to technology. They tested autonomous acoustic sensors--recording devices that have been used to record other animal sounds such as whale songs and bat squeaks--to see if the devices could improve surveys for marbled murrelets. Over the course of the murrelet breeding season, the team conducted two simultaneous but separate surveys inside known murrelet nesting territory: one conducted by trained observers and another based on analysis of recordings collected by autonomous sensors.</p>
<p>Back in the lab, automated detectors analyzing the field recordings identified just over 19,000 sounds as potential murrelet calls. After reviewing the recordings, researchers confirmed 7,218 actual calls, as the sensors sometimes mistook American robins and Swainson's thrushes for murrelets.</p>
<p>Over the entire breeding season, the sensors detected more murrelets than the human observers for less money than traditional surveys. Though human observers detected more murrelets than the sensors did on any given morning, the sensors simply spent more time in the field than surveyors did, and they cost nearly $200 less than traditional surveys per site, according to Croll.</p>
<p>"It's a lot less expensive to put a recorder out in the woods and have it turn itself on and off over many days than to have a person go out there," he said. "We can do this faster and more efficiently and cheaply by using these passive acoustic tools."</p>
<p>Croll and coauthors Bernie Tershy, assistant adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Matthew McKown, a former postdoctoral researcher in their lab, founded a company, Conservation Metrics, partway through the study. McKown is now the CEO of Conservation Metrics, which specializes in acoustic wildlife monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Expansive surveys</strong></p>
<p>According to Borker, the sensors could lead to more expansive surveys because of the reduced cost and added field time. Eventually, they may provide a better estimation of how murrelets respond to conservation efforts.</p>
<p>"This marriage of technology and wildlife monitoring is really exciting because we can start collecting data at much larger scales," said Borker. "When you can measure the outcomes for wildlife populations on the same scale you're doing conservation action, you start to get a much fuller picture of how good a job we're doing in protecting species or managing resources."</p>
<p>Coauthor Portia Halbert, an environmental scientist at California State Parks, has worked on efforts to protect murrelets from predators. In 2014, Halbert and scientists at Humboldt State University planted decoy murrelet eggs filled with nauseating substances to deter Stellar's jays from raiding murrelet nests. More thorough surveys could help researchers better evaluate the effectiveness of such conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The sensors offer another perk: permanent audio records of the murrelets' habitat. Whereas traditional surveys leave no physical record of the calls, the audio tracks could inform future research on the birds and their ecosystem, Borker said.</p>
<p>"You can think about the sounds of an ecosystem as a bit of a heartbeat of what's going on in that system," he said. "There's increasing evidence that we can learn a lot from these soundscapes, both about individual birds that might be calling in them, but also looking at the levels of complexity and diversity in those soundscapes as a measure of ecosystem health."</p>
<p>Borker, Croll, and Tershy are all members of the <a href="http://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Conservation Action Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz. The lab's mission is to develop cost-effective solutions to conservation issues, with a focus on seabirds and island ecosystems. This research was funded by the Packard Foundation Marine Birds Program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a35f3e780727017266c9f81adf4ff59"><name>questions-humanities-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>‘Questions That Matter’ public humanities series to focus on games and play </title><summary>Over the past decade, the revolution in gaming has created new communities, identities, and careers.

<p>They also have many of us obsessed with playing them, providing countless hours of entertainment for both kids and adults alike.</p>
<p>What is gained and what is lost as a result of the current &#8220;gamification&#8221; of life?</p>
<p>Is play mostly about having fun or does it also have a higher purpose?</p>
<p>How are games shaping the future and what it means to be human?</p>
<p>Those questions and many more will be discussed at the second installment of the <em>&#8220;Questions That Matter&#8221;</em> series, presented by the Institute for Humanities Research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>It all takes place on Tuesday, March 1, in downtown Santa Cruz at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center, beginning at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The series is designed to bring together two or more UC Santa Cruz scholars in conversation with community residents and students to explore questions that matter to all of us.</p>
<p>The topic this time out is &#8220;<em>PLAY: Games, Life, and Death.&#8221;</em> The featured guests will be UC Santa Cruz professors <strong>Kimberly Lau</strong> (Literature) and <strong>Noah Wardrip-Fruin</strong> (Computational Media). History professor <strong>Nathaniel Deutsch</strong>, director of the Institute for Humanities Research, will serve as the moderator.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The turnout for the last event was really extraordinary,&#8221; Deutsch noted. &#8220;I think it testified to the desire of the broader community to hear different perspectives on existential issues that affect all of us, and also the degree they want the university to serve the community as a source of experts and conversation on these types of questions.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;One of the most successful aspects of the event last time was the Q&amp;A,&#8220; he added. &#8220;A lot of the most provocative issues were raised by members of the audience. For them, it was an opportunity to have a conversation with the faculty without having to come to the university--the university came to them.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The <em>Questions That Matter</em> series is designed as both a lecture and a conversation, with plenty of time built in for audience questions and answers.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;For the last event, we went with the biggest scale possible for the question--talking about the cosmos itself. I&#8217;m not sure a few years ago we could follow up an event on the cosmos with a question about games.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;But with the extraordinary rise of the gamification of life, I don&#8217;t think anyone today would argue its global importance. Games are entering into every aspect of our life&#8212;entertainment, education, medical care, the military&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It&#8217;s also the case that the university has one of the best gaming programs in the country, and we&#8217;re right next door to Silicon Valley, so this is an ideal place host such a conversation,&#8221; Deutsch added.<br/>
<br/>
 Lau is a professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz, where she teaches courses on virtual worlds, fairy tales, vampire narratives, and theories of gender, race, and sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
 One of her ongoing research projects considers World of Warcraft, one of the most popular online games ever. She is the author of several books and articles, including <em>The Political Lives of Avatars: Play and Democracy in Virtual Worlds</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 Wardrip-Fruin is a professor of computational media who co-directs the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, a technical and cultural research group focused on games and computational media.<br/>
<br/>
 His projects have been presented by art venues such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as in games venues such as IndieCade and the Independent Games Festival. His most recent book is <em>Expressive Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games, and Software Studies (</em>2009).<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Gaming is a natural activity for people in the humanities to be involved with,&#8221; Deutsch observed. &#8220;Games are about characters, stories, imagining alternate pasts and futures, creating new worlds--all the things humanities scholars and students have been doing for centuries.&#8221;</p>

You can get a good idea of the magnitude of the disaster from a <a href="https://youtu.be/k0PWRiEWMTY">video</a> posted recently by geophysicist Steven Ward on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ingomar200">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>While you're there, you can browse through dozens of videos showing the geophysics of volcanoes, landslides, floods, tsunamis, and other natural and manmade disasters. The videos look like animations, but they are actually the product of physics-based computer simulations of the forces driving these events (mainly gravity, friction, and buoyancy).</p>
<p>Through his YouTube channel, which now has more than 2 million views, Ward is reaching a steadily growing audience. "I view it as a public service project," he said. "I'd like to think that maybe 20 of those viewers were inspired to a career in science."</p>
<p>For much of his career as a research geophysicist at UC Santa Cruz, Ward has been using computer simulations to study the dynamic processes that shape the Earth. About ten years ago, improvements in video editing software made it a lot easier for him to turn those simulations into short, educational movies.</p>
<p>"For decades I was publishing papers and doing the traditional things that academic scientists do, and then I just decided that I wanted to take the science directly to the people," Ward said. "I get instant feedback, viewers learn from them, and I have fun doing it."</p>
<p>Based on the feedback he gets, Ward knows that the videos are often used in schools, museums, and other educational settings, but it's hard to say what draws most of the viewers. Even the older videos continue to rack up viewer numbers. "My videos have a long shelf life," Ward said.</p>
<p>He launched the YouTube channel in 2010 and has now posted nearly 70 videos. The most popular one, with more than 300,000 views, is "<a href="https://youtu.be/y2IxUvF7ip4">Tsunami Krakatoa</a>," which shows what happened in the ocean after the explosive eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. Many of the videos recreate historic events, including the 1889 <a href="https://youtu.be/tMc9kP9q-d8">Johnstown Flood</a> in Pennsylvania and the 1928 <a href="https://youtu.be/3MdB_s6KhwA">St. Francis Dam disaster</a> in Los Angeles. Others represent possible future scenarios, such as a major eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in Italy ("<a href="https://youtu.be/x4tF_PfBWHs">Mt. Vesuvius: Pyroclastic Flow &amp; Tsunami</a>"), or the second most popular video on the site, "<a href="https://youtu.be/Zb4T8a1K5tw">La Palma Mega Tsunami</a>," which shows the consequences if the flank of a volcano in the Canary Islands were to collapse into the ocean.</p>
<p>While the physics behind the videos is highly sophisticated, the videos themselves are not slick productions. Ward emphasizes that "simulation is not animation." The movies lack a soundtrack--no voiceovers or music--just the simulations intercut with maps, photos, and short explanations that are easy to read on screen. Ward said many of his viewers may not speak English, noting that Italy and Indonesia rank second and third for viewer numbers behind the United States.</p>
<p>"I try to keep them short and tell an interesting story," Ward said. "It's important to keep it simple but not dilute the science."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2003/05/355.html</url><title>Massive tsunami sweeps Atlantic Coast in asteroid impact scenario for March 16, 2880</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/08/05/what-would-really-happen-if-a-tsunami-hit-san-francisco</url><title>What Would Really Happen If a Tsunami Hit San Francisco?</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="200c6c6c80727017266c9f817ecb261b"><name>alumni-dance-project</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni create moving tribute to movement</title><summary>'Muscle Memory' is a multimedia undertaking exploring creativity, aging, and the gifts of the UC Santa Cruz dance program.</summary><keywords>Muscle Memory, Mary Trunk, UC Santa Cruz dance program</keywords><start-date>1456473600000</start-date><display-name>Alumni create moving tribute to movement</display-name><path>/2016/02/alumni-dance-project</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/alumni-dance-project</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1456531598408</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1456775781087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/142542607" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></embed><width/><caption>"Muscle Memory" will be an interactive project about memory, dance, collaboration, and the pursuit of a creative life.</caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/02/images/alumni-dance-project-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2016/02/images/alumni-dance-project-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-dance-project-thumb.png</name><display-name>alumni-dance-project-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>19476</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alumni returned to campus to explore creativity, aging, and the gifts of the UC Santa Cr</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>'Muscle Memory' is a multimedia undertaking exploring creativity, aging, and the gifts of the UC Santa Cruz dance program</article-subhead><article-text><p>For a moment in the film, they look like students dancing amid the campus redwoods. Then, the camera moves in and the truth is revealed in the greying hair and the wrinkles that were not there before.</p>
<p>The dancing men and women are UC Santa Cruz alumni who graduated more than 30 years earlier and returned to the campus as part of a documentary film project being undertaken by alumna and filmmaker Mary Trunk.</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;Muscle Memory,&#8221; the multimedia undertaking explores the idea of creativity, of aging, and of what the UC Santa Cruz dance program gave to a small group of people who insist it changed their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the time period was so important to me, I had to reinvestigate it,&#8221; says the 54-year-old Trunk (Porter &#8217;84, theater arts), who now teaches documentary filmmaking and film production at two Southern California colleges. &#8220;I wanted to see if I could reignite those feelings in me. To see if I could move again.&#8221;</p>
<p>To hear Trunk and others in the short film tell it, UCSC&#8217;s dance department in the 1980s was a place ripe with experimentation and risk-taking. Influential choreographers like Betty Walberg, national medal of arts winner Meredith Monk, and post-modern dance originator Robert Ellis Dunn were brought in to teach, next to Theater Arts Professor Ruth Solomon, who once created an entire village out of wood and stone for one of her dance pieces.</p>
<p>Students explored social and personal topics and pushed boundaries. Trunk, for instance, remembers once taping garbage to the walls of the dance studio for a piece. Their bodies grew taut from grueling technique classes. They learned about collaboration and finding their creative spirit through choreography.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like it was this incredible fertile place that just kept us making work and creating things and you never felt discouraged,&#8221; Trunk says.&#160;</p>
<p>The result, says Trunk and two other dance alumni in the film, was the cultivation not only of creativity but also of a confidence that has continued in their lives.</p>
<p>Terri Jones (Merrill &#8217;83, theater arts) who danced in New York before returning to California where she now manages a specialized veterinary practice in San Francisco, says her time at UC Santa Cruz &#8220;allowed me to build a strong foundation to go out into the world. I foolishly thought I could conquer anything and that has served me well in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tells the story of coming back to California from New York without a job and opening a phone book to an ad for an automotive school. She enrolled and became a Japanese-car specialist for 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what I learned [from dance] is that you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re capable of until you try it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Kiera Coffee (Porter &#8217;85, theater arts), who is a writer and stylist living in Brooklyn, says the dance program at UC Santa Cruz helped her develop a kind of hyper awareness of others and her surroundings that is an important part of her work.</p>
<p>It was those kinds of experiences, according to Trunk, that drew alumni from as far away as Toronto and New York to the UC Santa Cruz campus for a four-day filming session in June in which they not only danced but also choreographed pieces. The project will eventually include archival dance footage, an original soundtrack, and an interactive website, Trunk says.</p>
<p>And while some of the dancers lament their stiff bodies, their lost technique, and the fact they hadn&#8217;t danced in nearly a quarter of a century, they have no regret about their experiences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time we felt like we were doing new things and people encouraged us,&#8221; Trunk says. &#8220;We were sort of in our own little world but it was a magical place and it worked and so you felt worthy.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2de3a63680727017266c9f813016c649"><name>arboretum-warriors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hoops for the Arboretum: Santa Cruz Warriors Community Jersey Night</title><summary>The Santa Cruz Warriors game on March 24 highlights and benefits the UCSC Arboretum.</summary><keywords>UCSC Arboretum, Santa Cruz Warriors</keywords><start-date>1456819200000</start-date><display-name>Hoops for the Arboretum: Santa Cruz Warriors Community Jersey Night</display-name><path>/2016/02/arboretum-warriors</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/arboretum-warriors</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1456763807257</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1456853276792</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Warriors game on Thursday, March 24, at 7 p.m. highlights and benefits the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Arboretum</a>. For every $25 ticket sold by the Arboretum, it receives $10 as well as proceeds from a silent auction. The Warriors play the Idaho Stampede in custom jerseys, generously presented by Allterra Solar, and attendees can bid on these during the game in the Kaiser Permanente Arena lobby. Winners will be announced at the end of the game and invited to join the players, who will autograph the jerseys and pose for pictures.</p>
<p>Jessica Fiske Bailey, Arboretum executive director, said she is thrilled with these partnerships. "We are excited to share our mission of conservation and sustainability with the Santa Cruz Warriors audience and attract new visitors to explore the gardens, learn about conservation and sustainability, and become inspired to support us as members, volunteers, or donors," she said.<br/>
<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is a unique oasis. This 134-acre garden features plants from Australia, California, South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. The collections showcase flowering shrubs and trees from Mediterranean climates, such as Santa Cruz here on the central coast, which survive long dry summers with minimal maintenance. Visitors to the Arboretum not only find a variety of water-wise plantings but also enjoy superb nature watching, including numerous colorful hummingbirds. The Arboretum also benefits UCSC students through experiential learning and attracts international researchers across many fields.<br/>
<br/>
 To support the Arboretum, tickets can be purchased via phone at at 831-502-2998, at the Arboretum Offices, Norrie's Gift &amp; Garden Shop, and during <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/hummingbird-days.html">Hummingbird Days</a> (March 5 and 6).<br/>

Steele, a renowned social psychologist and UC Berkeley&#8217;s executive vice chancellor and campus provost, will speak on his research on stereotypes and identity, Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 4 p.m. at the College Nine/Ten Multi-Purpose Room, UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Steele&#8217;s visit is the result of a recommendation in the 2015 final report of the UC Santa Cruz Black Experience Team that specifically highlighted his research on how stereotype threat can negatively impact historically marginalized communities in academic performance and social experiences.</p>
<p>The event is free and open to the public with <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2146&amp;cid=4002">pre-registration</a> requested, as seating is limited. Light refreshments will precede the lecture.</p>
<p>In his talk,&#160; &#8220;Stereotype threat: How it affects us and what we can do about it,&#8221; Steele will offer his first-person account of research that examines how racial and gender stereotypes can affect grades, test scores, and academic identity in ways that can perpetuate stereotype threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Research has shown that microaggressions&#8211;brief everyday exchanges that communicate denigrating, hostile, derogatory, or negative messages toward members of marginalized communities&#8211;can perpetuate stereotype threats,&#8221; said Sheree Marlowe, campus diversity officer for staff and students and a founding co-chair of the campus Black Experience Team.</p>
<p>The special working team was appointed by the chancellor&#8217;s Diversity Advisory Council and consists of 17 students, staff and faculty. It formed in late 2014 to understand the challenges of African American, black, and Caribbean students and identify key strategies to enhance the campus climate and success for those students.</p>
<p>Steele&#8217;s research helps inform those strategies. It focuses on the psychological experience of the individual, particularly on the experience of threats to the self and the consequences of those threats. His early work considered the self-image threat, self-affirmation and its role in self-regulation, the academic under-achievement of minority students, and the role of alcohol and drug use in self-regulation processes and social behavior.</p>
<p>Steele&#8217;s most recent book is <em>Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do</em> (W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2010).</p>
<p>Steele taught at Stanford University from 1991-2009 where he further developed the theory of stereotype threat. He served as provost of Columbia University from 2009-2011 until he returned to Stanford as the I. James Quillen Dean for the School of Education at from 2011&#8211;2014.</p>
<p>In 2014, he was named executive vice chancellor and provost, the chief academic officer on the UC Berkeley campus, where he has leadership responsibility for the planning, development, implementation, assessment and improvement of all academic programs, policies and supporting infrastructure. He also holds an appointment as professor in the Department of Psychology and the Graduate School of Education.</p>

Bad, very bad, or catastrophic, he asked. &#8220;Climate models didn&#8217;t predict this,&#8221; Chu said about heat impacting the ocean. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how long it will take cold oceans to warm up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On a macro level, Chu discussed the importance of energy trends in oil and natural gas, as well as alternatives such as wind and solar. &#160;He argued that science and technology can make clean energy an even more affordable option. But 100 percent of renewable energy will require carbon recycling, he argued.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We have a moral responsibility to the most innocent victims of climate change: the poorest citizens of the world and those yet to be born,&#8221; Chu said, challenging students to &#8220;be part of the solution. Make a personal statement on how you live life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In his Friday address, &#160;Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist from the Carnegie Institution for Science&#8217;s Department of Ecology, said, &#8220;Earth will do unexpected things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Nature doesn&#8217;t reveal all her secrets to you,&#8221; said Caldeira, whose work investigates how climate, carbon, and energy systems interact. He reflected on how he altered seawater chemistry to study impact of acidification on coral reef growth.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;How do you get from correlation to causation?&#8221; Caldeira asked. &#8220;Scientists aren&#8217;t allowed to fail anymore. Each time you fail, you learn something,&#8221; he added, saying that if research can reduce every degree of uncertainty that should be considered a success, not a failure.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Emerging diseases, public health, and climate change</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology and founder of the Science and Justice Research Center at UCSC, moderated the Saturday morning panel on &#160;public health. Panelists included Melinda R. Weathers (Clemson University), A. Marm Kilpatrick (UC Santa Cruz), &#160;Daniel Brooks, (University of Nebraska) and Mercedes Pascual (University of Chicago).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Emerging diseases are a predictable result of climate change, but with unpredictable results, panelists said.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The planet is going to do a lot of unexpected things,&#8221; said Brooks. He added that there are health issues still unknown, and they will show up.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Climate change is neglected in the health agenda,&#8221; added Pascual.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The panel agreed there needs to be more funding to investigate public health issues and risks. Research needs to make certain what some uncertainties will be.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But as panelist Kilpatrick asked, &#8220;What level of certainty do you need to take action before it&#8217;s too late?&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Geoengineering and climate change</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Slawek Tulaczyk, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, served as the moderator on the panel on</span> <a href="http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/what-is-geoengineering/what-is-geoengineering/?"><span>geoengineering</span></a><span>, the idea that the climate can be cooled through deliberate intervention.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Waleed Abdalati (University of Colorado, Boulder), Jeffrey Kiehl (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Michael Kraft (University of Wisconsin), and Alan Robock (Rutgers University), approached the idea of geoengineering with hesitation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Geoengineering does not go to the root cause of the problem,&#8221; said Kiehl.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Geoengineering should not be considered a quick fix but instead a measure of last resort, said Kraft. &#8220;There is a danger in taking a technical solution that requires no behavioral change,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Geopolitics of climate change</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ronnie D. Lipschutz, professor of politics and provost of College Eight, moderated the final panel of the day.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jacqueline Patterson (NAACP Climate Gap Initiative), Steven Lamy (University of Southern California), Diana Liverman (University of Arizona), and Stacy VanDeveer (University of New Hampshire), discussed the major economic, political, and social issues related to climate change, especially the considerations of environmental justice.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Make climate change personal</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With climate change posing many unpredictable problems, all panels agreed more action needs to be taken by individuals and decision makers. Climate change &#160;needs to be addressed as a personal problem as well as a global one, with real life consequences identified.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/photos/photos-2016/climate-conference/index.html</url><title>More conference photos</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://storify.com/UCSCSocSci/climate-science-policy-conference-2016</url><title>Social media coverage on Storify</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="332c949880727017266c9f8158f5dfc4"><name>travel-options-spring-break</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Travel options for Spring Break</title><summary>As we approach Spring Break, please keep UCSC’s private rideshare community, Zimride, in mind when making your travel plans.</summary><start-date>1456732800000</start-date><display-name>Travel options for Spring Break</display-name><path>/2016/02/travel-options-spring-break</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/02/travel-options-spring-break</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1456852472888</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1456852557596</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>

In any given month, I enjoy lectures, performances, workshops, and presentations that inspire, educate, and uplift me. Yes, it makes for some long days and late nights, but it's worth it.</p>
<p>Last week, alum William "Bro" Adams, chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, spoke to a full house at the Music Center Recital Hall about the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/wicked-problems/">value of the humanities today</a>. I particularly enjoyed hearing him discuss the shared founding principles of the NEH and UC Santa Cruz. Who knew our founding chancellor Dean McHenry and then-UC President Clark Kerr were also involved in the founding of the NEH?</p>
<p>Adams spoke eloquently of the lasting gifts of a liberal arts education, and my own path illustrates the intersections of humanities and science. In college, I wasn't thrilled about a history requirement, yet one of the most eye-opening classes I took was a course on the economic history of the United States. I still remember studying the railroad barons and learning that they essentially robbed their own country, yet they had profound and lasting impacts on the economic development of the United States.</p>
<p>Then, within a year of enrolling as a physics graduate student at UC San Diego, I became active in the anti-war movement and deeply interested in history. I read dozens of books about the history of the Far East and Europe, fascinated by the human element of history&#8212;the interplay of individuals and the forces of society. Would there have been a successful Chinese Revolution if Mao Zedong hadn't been born?</p>
<p>Today, history is more inclusive as modern scholars disprove the old adage that "History is written by the victors." And yet, history will always revolve around understanding the human condition and how we've gotten where we are today.</p>
<p>Literature, to me, is almost like an art form. It's distinct from the other humanities fields that way, while linguistics has both mathematical and cultural aspects. Philosophy, too, shares an interface with science. In my field of astrophysics, the theory of multiverses that emerged a decade or so ago is based on mathematical descriptions of how the world works. But without a test that would prove or disprove it, some ask whether the theory is science or philosophy. It's a worthwhile question&#8212;and a reminder of the artificial boundaries we sometimes draw between disciplines.</p>
<p>Bro Adams reminded me of the transformation I underwent thanks to the breadth of my own liberal arts education. My thanks to the Institute for Humanities Research and Anu Luther, who established the annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture, for bringing him to campus.</p>
<p>And now it's your turn. Looking ahead, I see an exceptionally rich slate of programming this month, and I invite you to expand your horizons by attending one or more of them. Challenge yourself by choosing something unusual or unfamiliar. I bet you'll be glad you did.</p>
