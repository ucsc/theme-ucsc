After launching the search in winter quarter and electing to continue developing the pool of applicants in spring quarter, outreach and advertisements for the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/cpevc-search/images/cpevc-position-profile.pdf">position</a> are in full swing. Applications are already arriving, and I am delighted to report that the applicant pool is growing.</p>
<p>Your personal outreach to prospective applicants as well as your nominations of highly qualified individuals are welcome and encouraged; please e-mail their names to Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni (ashish@ucsc.edu), search firm consultant Alberto Pimentel (apsearch@storbeckpimentel.com), or me (plkoch@ucsc.edu).</p>
<p>In September, the search committee plans to begin evaluating files. The committee will select eight to 10 applicants for screening interviews. The names of those applicants will remain confidential.</p>
<p>Following that, we expect to identify three or four finalists who will be invited for formal campus visits. During these two-day campus visits (October 13&#8211;14, October 17&#8211;18, October 20&#8211;21, October 24&#8211;25, October 27&#8211;28), candidates will meet with a variety of stakeholders, including administrative and Academic Senate leaders, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and campus supporters. Although we have tentatively secured five possible visit dates, we will only need three or four.</p>
<p>During the finalist visits, the entire campus community will be invited to attend both a public forum, 10:30&#8211;11:30 a.m., in the Stevenson Event Center, on the first day of each visit as well as a scholarly research talk and reception, 3:30&#8211;5:00 p.m., in the McHenry Library, on the second day. Please mark your calendars. Other details (candidate names and CVs) will be available on the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/cpevc-search/">search website</a> as the visit dates draw closer. Public talks will be recorded and made available after all candidates have visited.</p>
<p>After the visits, the search committee will invite and collect input from the campus community (via a well-publicized online survey), evaluate that input and their own assessments of the candidates, and then submit a report to Chancellor Blumenthal who will decide upon a candidate and negotiate to secure their appointment.</p>
<p>Please contact Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni or me with questions. Thank you in advance for your participation.</p>

Lactation is one of the most demanding physiological processes that animals can experience, and for sea otter mothers the challenge can be life threatening. A new study has found that the energetic cost of rearing a pup is even higher than researchers had previously estimated.</p>
<p>"We had been seeing a disproportionately high amount of adult female southern sea otter mortality at the end of lactation. This suggested that lactation was a particularly difficult life stage for females, but we had no idea exactly how costly it was," said biologist Nicole Thometz, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz working with Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Thometz is first author of the new study, published August 3 in the <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org"><em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em></a>. In a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/sea-otter-moms.html">previous study</a>, she used the energetics of growing sea otter pups to evaluate the cost of parenting and estimated that sea otter mothers might have to double their consumption of food to see the pup through to independence. To find out exactly how much energy it takes to raise a sea otter pup, however, the team needed to measure the resting metabolic rate of a lactating sea otter mother directly. With a moratorium on captive breeding of sea otters, there seemed little chance that they would have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Then a pair of young sea otter females &#8211; Mollie and Clara &#8211; arrived at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. When veterinarian Mike Murray gave the animals a physical examination, he discovered that Clara was pregnant. "Mike called me to let me know what an amazing opportunity we had on our hands," Thometz recalled.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Metabolic data</strong></p>
<p>The sea otters were relocated to facilities at the UC Santa Cruz Coastal Science Campus, where Williams and Thometz worked with trainers Traci Kendall and Beau Richter to collect metabolic data. They trained Mollie to enter an acrylic dome where they could record her oxygen consumption at rest. With Clara, however, they needed to minimize any changes to her natural behavior, because the team intended to return her pup to the wild. So they gently transferred her into the dome using a net, successfully repeating the maneuver when Clara was suckling her pup after the birth.</p>
<p>Clara had caught the team off guard when she gave birth a month earlier than expected. "Beau asked one of our other trainers to take a look at Clara, and by the time the trainer got over to her, she was pulling the pup out from between her flippers," Thometz said.</p>
<p>Comparing Mollie's and Clara's metabolism over 12 months, the team saw that Clara's resting metabolic rate at the end of the pregnancy was 16.6 percent lower than her resting metabolic rate after weaning the pup, which is similar to the metabolic rate drop seen in other pregnant marine mammals. The researchers speculate that this reduction could allow sea otters to accumulate fat reserves in preparation for milk production. After the birth of her pup and as it grew, however, Clara's daily energy demands soared, more than doubling by the time the pup was 4 months old. Meanwhile, her resting metabolic rate increased by 51 percent.</p>
<p>"We found the cost of pup rearing to be significantly higher than previously estimated," Thometz said. "This represents a substantial energetic burden for a species with already high baseline energy demands and minimal energy reserves and is likely one of the underlying reasons why we are seeing high mortality rates for prime age females at the end of lactation."</p>

<br/>
 Parr, an education coordinator at UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and the conference&#8217;s lead organizer, featured students throughout the conference program, giving examples of how they advocate for social justice, nutrition security, and food equity.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Mobilizing with media</strong><br/>
<br/>
 Included was the premiere of a <a href="https://vimeo.com/176376023">music video by David Robles</a> (Cowell, history, &#8217;16) about how students create community through farming and food systems. The film was made with the support of&#160; the University of California&#8217;s Global Food Initiative, a system-wide effort across the&#160; 10 UC campuses to address how to sustainably and nutritiously feed a world population expected to reach 8 billion by 2025.<br/>
<br/>
 Sustainability begins by students being leaders, said Robles, a 2016 GFI fellow. Each year,&#160; several undergraduate and graduate fellows are selected on each campus to work on food-related projects.<br/>
<br/>
 Robles said the intention of the video is for people to learn to take initiative. He wants students to collaborate on their campuses. Community gardening, composting, recycling, and student-driven initiatives such as the Real Food Challenge and the Food Systems Working Group are featured as ways to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The work around food systems really has the opportunity to bring people together and facilitate collaboration,&#8221; said Robles, who has worked as a farm assistant at CASFS since his freshman year. He is finishing his degree this summer and will work for the youth empowerment and food justice organization &#8220;Food, What?!&#8221; in the fall. He is also applying to be an apprentice in CASFS&#8217;s Ecological Horticulture program for spring 2017.<br/>
<br/>
 Robles&#8217;s video was one in a series of GFI-supported films shown at the conference. SAEA attendees were invited to see films from five other UC campuses that center around food systems and sustainability at their school. Included was a short movie about a sustainable grocery store managed by UC Berkeley students and a story about plant breeding at UC Davis.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Food is the centerpiece of coming together,&#8221; said Carlos Lemos, a UCSC student in the Social Documentation Program and producer of another GFI-supported film shown at SAEA. Lemos focuses on the CASFS apprenticeship program and how social justice is linked to food systems.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Creating change through advocacy</strong><br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;A student can challenge an entire system,&#8221; said Tim Galarneau (College Eight, psychology and community studies, &#8217;05).<br/>
<br/>
 Galarneau, who leads community-engaged education at CASFS, should know. Since his undergraduate years he has been instrumental in advancing the UC&#8217;s commitment to make food services healthier and sustainable. He co-chairs the GFI&#8217;s Food Access &amp; Security subcommittee. In addition, he co-founded the Real Food Challenge, a nonprofit that leverages the power of youth and universities to create a healthy, fair, and green food system.<br/>
<br/>
 As part of the SAEA&#8217;s program, Galarneau chaired a panel about achieving food security and sustainability on college campuses. Panelists featured students from groups Galarneau is deeply involved with, including the UCSC Food Systems Working Group, the Real Food Challenge, and GFI&#8217;s food security program.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Tracking food purchases</strong></p>
<p>Included in the panel was current UC Santa Cruz undergraduate student Ellen Stone (College Ten, environmental studies, &#8217;17), a member of the UCSC Food Systems Working Group and leader of the Real Food Calculator project, a tracking system that assesses the standard of food purchases made by UCSC&#8217;s dining services. The tool considers whether products and vendors are local and community based, humane to animals, fair to workers, and ecologically sound.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The Real Food Calculator is about making the food system transparent,&#8221; Stone said. Researching and analyzing the supply chain was not easy, she said. She found that suppliers and sales representatives often did not want to speak with students, and that it took persistence to get the information they needed.<br/>
<br/>
 As Galarneau and other participants at SAEA emphasized, students are critical to creating a sustainable future.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to Robles, Stone, and Lemos involvement at SAEA, other UC Santa Cruz student presenters included Katie Monsen, a Ph.D. student in environmental studies and Ryan Duncan, an undergraduate in the department, who spoke about building a student leadership program and ways to improve production management on the campus farm. Monika Egerer and Hamutahl Cohen, Ph.D. students in environmental studies, hosted a workshop about incorporating research-based teaching methods into an agricultural curriculum. Cohen is also a 2016 GFI fellow.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://vimeo.com/176376023</url><title>'Can UC' Hip hop video</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/saea-conference.html</url><title>National conference marks 10 years of growth in sustainable agriculture education</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="520ffd598072701713dacb130bfbc1b6"><name>pbsci-advising</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reorganization of Divisional Undergraduate Affairs Office</title><summary>The Division of Physical and Biological Sciences is reorganizing its undergraduate advising unit.</summary><keywords>Physical and Biological Sciences, Undergraduate Advising</keywords><start-date>1470207600000</start-date><display-name>Reorganization of Divisional Undergraduate Affairs Office</display-name><path>/2016/08/pbsci-advising</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/pbsci-advising</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1470255593307</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1470256090284</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="page" title="Page 1">

<p><span>In Winter 2015, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences convened a review committee to document, assess, and evaluate our consolidated undergraduate advising unit, Undergraduate Affairs. This was in response to questions raised by the CP/EVC and concerns about the quality and accessibility of advising in the division that surfaced in several external reviews. Our centralized undergraduate affairs unit was created in the fall of 2009, in an effort to concentrate our advising efforts during the initial rounds of budget cutting just after the 2008 economic crisis. We commend all those who worked tirelessly to make our centralized model work.</span></p>
<p><span>Though we created some efficiencies, we found disadvantages to the centralized unit, and based on the findings and internal assessment, we have decided to reinvest in departmental undergraduate advising effective August 1, 2016. Some critical functions will remain centralized: DRC testing accommodations, curriculum planning, scheduling and enrollment management oversight, catalog updates, data analysis, and academic program review and development support. New advising contact information may be found</span> <span>&#8203;</span><a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/academics/advising-contacts.html"><span>here</span></a><span>&#8203;</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Our primary commitment is to the students. It is with that in mind that we are carefully planning for this transition to make it as seamless as possible. Through the month of August, we will be in state of flux and appreciate your support and patience as we gear up for Fall Quarter. We are diligently working to update resource materials and websites, transition to a new reporting structure, and manage multiple office relocations.</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the collective efforts of those in the Physical and Biological Sciences and across campus who are aiding us in improving the student experience at UC Santa Cruz. It is my sincere hope that we can build a stronger fundamental connection between students, academic advisers, department staff and faculty through this strategic reinvestment in undergraduate advising.</span></p>

The team also developed a computational approach for analyzing patient-specific data to help doctors choose the most effective drugs for individual patients.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30913-8">published August 4 in <em>Cell</em></a>, was a collaborative effort involving research teams at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA. They began with clinical tissue samples obtained at autopsy from patients with lethal metastatic prostate cancer, then performed a range of sophisticated analyses to characterize the cancer cells from each patient in unprecedented detail. A novel computational analysis of the resulting datasets produced personalized diagrams of signaling pathways in the cancer cells of each patient, the details of which suggest potential targets for therapy.</p>
<p>"It's like having a blueprint for each tumor. This is our dream for personalized cancer therapy, so we're not just guessing any more about which drugs will work but can choose drug targets based on what's driving that patient's cancer," said Josh Stuart, the Baskin professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, director of cancer and stem cell genomics at the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genomics Institute</a>, and a senior corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>"Therapies for metastatic prostate cancer are urgently needed," said Dr. Owen Witte, founding director of the <a href="https://www.stemcell.ucla.edu/">Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research</a> at UCLA, university professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, and a senior author of the paper. "This type of interdisciplinary research is critical as we seek to pinpoint the cellular changes occurring in aggressive prostate cancer and cross new boundaries in understanding the disease."</p>
<p><strong>Personalized treatment</strong></p>
<p>Cancer genomics promises to enable personalized cancer treatment by revealing the genetic mutations driving an individual patient's tumor cells. But interpreting the genomic data remains a challenge. The effects of mutations and other genetic changes in cancer cells play out in the complex networks of molecular interactions or "signaling pathways" involved in cell growth, proliferation, and other hallmarks of cancer biology. &#160;By mapping the key pathways active in prostate cancer cells, the researchers were able to identify the "master switches" in those pathways that could be targeted with drugs to disrupt the disease.</p>
<p>A key step in many signaling pathways is "phosphorylation," the activation or deactivation of a protein by adding a phosphate group at certain sites on the protein. The enzymes that phosphorylate proteins are called kinases, and many new cancer drugs are kinase inhibitors. A major component of the study was a comprehensive analysis of the "phosphoproteome" of prostate cancer tumors and cells, revealing changes in the phosphorylation states of cellular proteins.</p>
<p>Justin Drake, a postdoctoral researcher in Witte's lab at UCLA (now an assistant professor at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey), led the phosphoproteomics work, producing a new encyclopedia of protein phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells and tissues. Evan Paull, a graduate student in Stuart's lab at UC Santa Cruz (now at Columbia University), led the computational analyses, which involved integrating the phosphoproteomic data with genomic and gene expression datasets to provide a unified view of the activated signaling pathways in late stage prostate cancer. Drake and Paull are co-first authors of the paper.</p>
<p>"Having the phosphoproteomics data in addition to the traditional genomics and transcriptomics enabled us to get a more comprehensive view of aberrant signaling in this disease," Paull said. "We developed a method to integrate these multiple large datasets to understand what's driving the disease in individual patients."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Anti-androgen therapy</strong></p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. The main treatment for advanced cases is androgen deprivation, because the male sex hormones (androgens, including testosterone) stimulate prostate cancer growth. Anti-androgen therapies target either androgen synthesis or the androgen receptor. Eventually, however, most cases of metastatic prostate cancer become resistant to these therapies.</p>
<p>The new study revealed some of the mechanisms behind the resistance to anti-androgen therapies. According to Stuart, in many cases a mutation results in changes to the androgen receptor protein. In other cases, alternative kinase signaling pathways allow the cancer cells to keep growing even though androgen-receptor signaling is blocked.&#160;</p>
<p>Individual profiles based on the analysis of each patient's tumor cells revealed clinically relevant information that could be used to prioritize the drugs most likely to be effective in these cases. The tool used to generate these individual profiles goes by the acronym pCHIPS, and the researchers created an <a href="https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/pchips">online pCHIPS resource</a> that allows users to make patient-specific network predictions based on their own data and visualize the results using the pCHIPS methodology.</p>
<p>Applying these methods to prostate cancer cell lines, the researchers found that accurate predictions of drug sensitivity could be achieved using either genomics data or phosphoproteomics data alone. That's important because the comprehensive set of analyses performed on clinical samples in this study is unlikely to be available to most patients. Clinical use of genomics, however, is growing.</p>
<p>Stuart explained that the integrated datasets from multiple analyses enabled the researchers to build a generic model of the signaling networks involved in metastatic prostate cancer. The pCHIPS tool uses that generic model and refines it based on patient-specific data, such as the genetic mutations in a patient's cancer cells.</p>
<p>"For now it's a research tool, but the hope is to have a strategy like this to use in the clinic," Stuart said. "These mutations in the genome create a lot of havoc in the cell, and trying to interpret the genomic information can be overwhelming. You need the computer to help you make sense of it and find the Achilles heel in the network that you can hit with a drug."</p>

<p>Napolitano smiled as she recalled her first all-hands meeting after President Bill Clinton named her U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona in 1993. No one in the predominantly male audience of prosecutors and federal law enforcement agents was rude, she remembered. &#8220;But yet you could feel something,&#8221; she said. &#8220;&#8216;Who is this girl who&#8217;s going to be our boss?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The student&#8217;s question came on day two of Napolitano&#8217;s visit to UC Santa Cruz. She was meeting with 11 girls, ages 13 to 17, who are taking part in the weeklong <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/yei/">Youth Empowerment Institute</a> (YEI), an annual summer camp for girls organized by the campus&#8217;s Everett Program that merges college access topics with emerging technology.</p>
<p>Napolitano arrived on campus Monday afternoon and visited the <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/">Dickens Universe</a> and the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Farm</a>. She also took part in a reception for local elected officials at the Farm, followed by dinner with campus guests at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn.</p>
<p>After a tour of the Farm with Daniel Press, executive director of the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a>, Napolitano noted how the UCSC Farm and Garden, now approaching its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary, has been ahead of its time in teaching skills in organic and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Game design and robotics</strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Napolitano stopped by the Game Design and the Robotics and Networks clusters of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) before visiting YEI.&#160;</p>
<p>The girls have been working this week on updating YEI College Mentor, a mobile app first created by participants in the 2014 class. The goal of the program is to equip girls with two sets of skills, said Thomas Gelder (College Ten, &#8216;13, sociology), technology manger for the Everett Program. First, he said, is the knowledge to pursue a college education, and second, are the digital skills needed to share that knowledge with other students. Over five days, students will learn to code the app that serves as a digital college counselor.</p>
<p>Napolitano told the group that being underestimated means you have to &#8220;work really hard, master the material&#8211;never go into a meeting unprepared&#8211;and seek advice.&#8221; You don&#8217;t always have to take the advice, she told the group, but it&#8217;s important to listen.</p>
<p>The UC president listened as the girls described their backgrounds and their hopes for the future. She advised them to &#8220;aspire very high because the opportunities are here for you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Everett Program</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org">Everett Program</a> is named for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nkygtj0xzY">Dorothy E. Everett</a>, a longtime UC staffer who became the university&#8217;s assistant president. UCSC alumnus Mark Headley, who serves as the program&#8217;s co-chair, selected the name when he helped endow the Dorothy E. Everett Global Information and Social Entrepreneurship Chair. Formerly known as the Global Information Internship Program, the program harnesses the creativity and passion of young people to make a difference in the world by using information and communications technology and teaching others how to use it.</p>
<p>In her meeting with YEI participants, Napolitano described her undergraduate liberal arts curriculum at Santa Clara University after initially being a music major. Monday, during her visit to the <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/">Dickens Universe 2016</a>, she talked about why intellectual activities such as the Dickens program are important to public research universities and read a quote from Mr. Morfin, a character in <em>Dombey and Son,</em>&#160;the focus of this year&#8217;s gathering.</p>
<p>&#8220;The process he describes&#8212;of looking at familiar people and places through new and distant points of view, and of being shaken in our habits&#8212;is the process we each experience when we read a transformative novel, when we see a timeless painting, or when we listen to a powerful symphony,&#8221; Napolitano said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the process that, fundamentally, makes us human.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the University of California, the humanities are a cornerstone of our world-renowned research and education missions," she said.</p>
<p>The Dickens Universe&#8212;and the Dickens Project&#8212;play an important role in UC&#8217;s mission to ensure the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next; to broaden our understanding of the human experience; and to foster our intellectual curiosity and our empathy as members of a diverse and democratic society, Napolitano said.</p>
<p>Tuesday, at COSMOS, high school students showed Napolitano the robots&#8212;called &#8220;cockroaches&#8221;&#8212;that they are programming to avoid light, hide in the dark, and not get stuck.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>COSMOS camp</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://cosmos.ucsc.edu/">COSMOS</a> is an intensive four-week residential camp that prepares high school students for careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. About 170 high school students from throughout the state enrolled in the program at UC Santa Cruz this summer.</p>
<p>The students are writing code in the programming language C and installing it on the robots for testing, explained computer engineering professor Gabriel Elkaim. The training began with students learning about simple coding commands before using the light and bump sensors on the robots. The hands-on approach gives students an opportunity to debug their own work. The critical thinking skills they acquire will be helpful in an array of fields beyond computer programming.</p>
<p>Computer engineering professor Tracy Larrabee said the projects offer a tangible and testable example for the abstract reasoning that underlies computer code.</p>

<p>The seventh national SAEA conference drew a record number of participants from across the U.S. and as far away as Brazil and Sweden. More than 350 students, faculty, staff, farmers, chefs, and community group members gathered for three days of workshops, panel discussions, presentations, and World Caf&#233;-style brainstorming sessions centered on &#8220;The Ecology of Food Systems: Engaging Interdisciplinary and Applied Education for a Just and Sustainable Agriculture.&#8221; The conference was hosted by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) with major support from the UC Global Food Initiative.</p>
<p>The conference theme reflects an increased interest in food system and food justice topics that go beyond the environmental and biophysical aspects of sustainable agriculture. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge focus on inequities in food systems today, and on bringing social justice topics into the classroom,&#8221; says Stacy Philpott, professor of environmental studies at UCSC.</p>
<p>More and more colleges and universities are developing campus farms and gardens, sustainable agriculture degree programs, and food system majors&#8212;often in response to student demand for experiential, in-depth learning opportunities about agriculture and the larger food system.</p>
<p>Conference organizer and SAEA co-founder Damian Parr, education coordinator for CASFS, says, &#8220;The first conference 10 years ago was more focused on the land-based practices and student farms&#8212;that&#8217;s still important, but we&#8217;re encompassing and integrating a broader range of issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Presenters share lessons</strong></p>
<p>Conference presenters shared experiences in developing interdisciplinary opportunities. Saskia Cornes, who runs the Duke Campus Farm in Durham, N.C., described her efforts to connect students with the social history of the land they&#8217;re farming, using the tobacco, cotton, and indigo grown on the farm to generate discussions not only of agronomy but of the complex social history surrounding those crops. She also sees the farm as a way to give students a place to develop &#8220;reparative relationships&#8221; with the land that may help overcome a sense of despair in the face of current environmental and social challenges.</p>
<p>Christof Bernau and Kellee Matsushita of CASFS led a workshop on how they integrate food justice topics into their work with students and apprentices at the UCSC Farm. &#8220;For example when we&#8217;re talking about plant families it&#8217;s a chance to infuse some social history&#8212;who were the first cultivators, why were these crops important as cultural resource, and how have issues such as colonialism affected how those crops are used now?&#8221; Bernau said.</p>
<p>Other workshops emphasized the types of practical, experiential skills that students often seek on campus farms and gardens, and how to address the challenges of teaching those skills.</p>
<p>Jane Kuhn, who helps manage the production fields at the UCSC Farm, shared her ideas for teaching proper irrigation practices&#8212;a math-heavy topic that students can find intimidating. &#8220;We make it simple to start, with a basic approach and straightforward formula for calculating how much water is being applied in a drip system or through overhead irrigation,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Students build on those basic concepts as they practice and gain confidence until they can set up and run irrigation systems on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Youth Movement</strong></p>
<p>When asked to reflect on the current state of sustainable agriculture education, Philpott noted the relative youth of the field. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see that people who are this effort&#8217;s leaders are in their 40s or younger,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The field has a big and promising future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of that future has been seeded by graduates of the CASFS Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture and other UCSC programs, which were well represented throughout the conference.</p>
<p>A number of Apprenticeship graduates presented work on the educational programs they&#8217;ve started since graduating: Albie Miles, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, is developing UH&#8217;s campus farm and sustainable community food systems program. Parr helped create many of the experiential education opportunities for undergraduates at the CASFS Farm and Garden. Patrick Archie gave a tour of Stanford&#8217;s new O&#8217;Donahue Family Educational Farm, which he manages, and Jered Lawson and Nancy Vail hosted conference participants at their Pie Ranch educational farm in Pescadero. Guy Kilpatric and Meredith Epstein shared the programming work they&#8217;ve developed at the University of Maryland&#8217;s new Terp Farm. UCSC graduate Kevin Cody talked about the challenges of creating an organic farm at the University of Northern Colorado on a site ringed by conventional agriculture and fracking operations, and how their efforts can address food security issues in the local community.</p>
<p>Education programs and food justice efforts also extend to the larger campus food system, where students have led campaigns to push for more sustainable food in the campus dining halls.</p>
<p>UCSC graduate Tim Galarneau, now a food systems researcher at CASFS, has spearheaded these efforts within the UC system and beyond, working with students, staff, faculty and administrators to boost the amount of local, organic, sustainably produced food purchased by campus dining programs and create learning opportunities for students interested in how they can help improve the food system.</p>
<p>At the conference&#8217;s Real Food Challenge dinner prepared by UCSC Catering, Galarneau and students from UCSC, Cal State Monterey Bay, and the University of Massachusetts talked about the nationwide effort to get more &#8220;real food&#8221; onto student&#8217;s plates&#8212;often in the face of institutional barriers. But as Hannah Weinronk, a leader in the nationwide Real Food Challenge movement said, &#8220;The harder they make it, the harder students will fight.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Roots of SAEA</strong></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s SAEA conference marks 10 years since the sustainable agriculture educators&#8217; first gathering at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove that gave rise to the national organization. Then a CASFS staff member, Miles helped organized that first meeting, along with Parr, and Mark Van Horn, director of UC Davis&#8217;s Student Farm.</p>
<p>Miles recalls, &#8220;We had been doing local meetings of agricultural educators in California, supported by a Kellogg grant. It soon became clear that there was a national trend taking place and a need to convene academics and practitioners to share best practices when it comes to experiential and hands-on learning in sustainable agriculture.&#8221; Out of that 2006 gathering came the idea for the Sustainable Agriculture Education Association (<a href="http://sustainableaged.org/">http://sustainableaged.org/</a>), which today serves and connects educators, staff, students, and administrators teaching sustainable agriculture, and champions innovative educational approaches.</p>
<p>In the 10 years since the SAEA&#8217;s founding, sustainable agriculture education efforts have spread quickly. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing a rapid expansion of post-secondary programs in sustainable agriculture,&#8221; says Miles. &#8220;This is happening at small liberal arts institutions as well as land grant institutions, along with an increase in the number of farmer training programs. The conference serves the growth of those programs.&#8221;</p>

The award provides a $20,000 grant to emeritus faculty in the chemical sciences in support of undergraduate research to be conducted under their guidance.</p>
<p>The Crews lab isolates and characterizes unique chemicals from sponges and marine microorganisms, searching for compounds with potential therapeutic value in treating human diseases. The new grant will support a program of &#8220;Adventures in Bioorganic Chemistry for Undergraduates: Exploring Small Molecule Scaffold Diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews has mentored undergraduate researchers throughout his career at UC Santa Cruz. In 1994, with a grant from the National Institutes of Health, he founded the ACCESS program to introduce community college students from underrepresented backgrounds to research opportunities at UC Santa Cruz. Crews, who retired from regular teaching duties in 2012, maintains an active research laboratory. He was awarded an Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorship for the 2015-16 academic year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many emeritus faculty no longer teach courses nor take on graduate students. Their wealth of experience and knowledge, however, makes them a unique and valuable educational resource for undergraduates,&#8221; said Mark Cardillo, executive director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation. &#8220;This program provides for the development of a relationship where these senior scientists guide the students in perhaps their first research experience to generate new knowledge. Firsthand experience with the scientific research process is of value to all students, some of whom may be motivated to join the next generation of chemists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Established in 1946, the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation is a leading non-profit organization devoted to the advancement of the chemical sciences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="709bc3778072701713dacb1331044068"><name>in-memoriam-doreena-raines-reade</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Doreena Raines-Reade</title><summary>Doreena Raines-Reade, who worked in the CHES Facilities unit as the Operations Coordinator for nine years, died July 22.

<p>Solt comes to the campus from the California Institute of the Arts School of Theater (CalArts), where she is a longtime professor of theater. While at CalArts, she served as dean for eight years (1995-2003), during which she was also founding artistic director/producer of the CalArts Center for New Theater (renamed the Center for New Performance in 2006).</p>
<p>Prior to that, she was senior vice president of production for Miramax Films and an award-winning producer of feature films for Warner Bros., including <em>Presumed Innocent</em> starring Harrison Ford and <em>Doc Hollywood</em> with Michael J. Fox. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be more pleased that Chancellor Blumenthal and EVC/Provost Alison Galloway have honored me with the extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to lead the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division,&#8221; said Solt. &#8220;This is a critical time for the arts and arts education, and I embrace the chance to serve this great university with its dynamic leadership, impressive programs, its stellar faculty, exceptional and devoted staff, and its talented, eager and promising students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mission will be to champion the arts through the Arts Division in the face of increasing challenges, on stages both local and international, and with all constituencies,&#8221; Solt added. &#8220;With humility, I hope to be the transformational leader who has the proactive vision to lead the Arts Division into a future of prosperity, while building on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s legacy, its relationship with the community, with stakeholders beyond, and with its alumni.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solt&#8217;s training and background are in theater and film production.</p>
<p>She earned her M.F.A. in theater administration from the Yale School of Drama, as well as a M.A. in African American studies, a M.A. in U.S. history, and a C.Phil. in Atlantic history from UCLA, where she is completing a doctorate. Her dissertation is titled <em>The Biography of Othello: A Signifying Life in the History of the Construction of Race.</em></p>
<p>Solt is also completing a book based on her popular CalArts entrepreneurship class titled <em>Da Vinci&#8217;s Mindset: The Artist&#8217;s Life of Purpose Through Creative Entrepreneurship</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted that Dean Solt will be joining us,&#8221; said Alison Galloway, campus provost and executive vice chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I particularly appreciate her commitment to enabling students to plan for careers as artists, expanding their opportunities to pursue their creative activities to the fullest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solt studied acting in London and has worked closely as a producer with Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alan J. Pakula. Her film career began with Pakula's <em>Sophie's Choice</em>, starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline. Among her duties, she served as Streep&#8217;s Polish dialect coach.</p>
<p>She also worked with Jerzy Grotowski of the acclaimed Laboratory Theater in Poland, and as a producer with executives at Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox. In 2002, she won an NAACP Theatre Award for an internationally acclaimed, site-specific, all-female production of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>King Lear</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just an exciting appointment for me, it is a dream come true,&#8221; Solt noted. &#8220;My entire life has prepared me through a range of contexts, as both a cross-disciplinary practitioner and as a scholar, to be a leader of all the arts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having grown up on the campus of a state university as the daughter of two professors, a historian father, and a poet mother, I welcome this opportunity to represent the arts on the campus of a great public university--one that enchanted me and has stayed in my imagination since I first visited the campus as a child many years ago,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Solt will succeed Bill Ladusaw, who has led the Arts Division as interim dean since January, and David Yager, who served as dean of the Arts Division from July 2009 to January 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="762f5dd98072701713dacb13126e083b"><name>arts-dean-appointment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of Arts Dean</title><summary>We are very pleased to announce the appointment of Susan Solt as dean of the Arts Division.

This announcement addresses changes in both Santa Cruz Metro and UC Santa Cruz transit services.<br/>
 <br/>
 The Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District is announcing a series of service changes that may impact campus riders. While there are reductions in some areas, the final plan preserves far more UCSC service than had been originally anticipated. In response to a proposed 14 percent reduction to campus service, TAPS and Metro staff worked diligently to identify the most-used and least-used UCSC trips. Following careful analysis, the final outcome is that the campus is paying slightly more for the 2016-17 service period, which is preserving nearly all "school term" service.<br/>
 <br/>
 Changes will include reconfiguring school-term trips to align with the revised 2016-2017 class schedule, rerouting Route 20 UCSC/Westside evening trips to serve the Safeway/Almar Shopping Center, as well as adding service to the Coastal Science Campus on two Route 3 Mission/Beach weekday morning trips. Metro service reductions to the campus will include elimination of the Route 12 UCSC/Eastside (which provided one trip from 41st Avenue to campus on weekday mornings), and elimination of several low-ridership morning trips on other UCSC routes. A <a href="http://www.scmtd.com/en/">preview of Metro's Fall Service</a> changes is available on their website.<br/>
 <br/>
 While the Metro plans for service to the campus are positive, these outcomes and the additional funding needed to achieve them require reductions in services by the Campus Transit Operation.<br/>
 <br/>
 Campus Transit service changes that will be implemented in fall quarter 2016 include: <br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Sunday through Thursday Night Owl service will be eliminated, and Friday and Saturday Night Owl service will end 40 minutes earlier, at 2:10 a.m.&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Downtown Bike Shuttle service will be eliminated, and Westside Bike Shuttle service will end 90 minutes earlier, at 11:30 a.m.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Four transit-style shuttle buses will provide additional capacity on the Loop and Upper Campus routes during peak demand periods<br/>
 Funded by parking fees, the Traffic Control program will be expanded to increase traffic flow during class breaks and peak hours. TAPS is also working to pilot an alternative night-time on-demand service for student on-campus transportation needs.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7beee14e8072701713dacb13c95d7a5a"><name>cryptic-female-choice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Female fish can favor sperm from preferred males despite external fertilization</title><summary>A new way in which a female can choose the best father for her offspring is seen in a colorful Mediterranean fish.</summary><keywords>cryptic female choice, Suzanne Alonzo, ocellated wrasse, ovarian fluid, sneaker males, nesting males</keywords><start-date>1471359600000</start-date><display-name>Female fish can favor sperm from preferred males despite external fertilization</display-name><path>/2016/08/cryptic-female-choice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/cryptic-female-choice</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1470958066620</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1471359800237</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/pretty-male-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/pretty-male-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pretty-male-400.jpg</name><display-name>pretty-male-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>103479</file-size><width>400</width><height>309</height></image><image-alt>male ocellated wrasse</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/pretty-male-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/pretty-male-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pretty-male-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>pretty-male-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>61359</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>male ocellated wrasse</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>A nesting male ocellated wrasse collects algae for his nest.

<p>The animal kingdom is full of elaborate traits and behaviors by which females choose mates. Even in species in which the female mates with multiple males, biologists have found evidence of "cryptic female choice" involving mechanisms in the reproductive tract that influence which male's sperm fertilize the eggs.</p>
<p>The new study, published August 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, demonstrates cryptic female choice in a fish, the ocellated wrasse, in which fertilization takes place externally during spawning. The researchers found that something in the ovarian fluid released with the eggs influences which male's sperm is most likely to fertilize them.</p>
<p>Female ocellated wrasses prefer males that build nests and take care of the fertilized eggs as they develop. But there are other types of males that do not provide parental care and compete to fertilize the eggs a female lays in the nest prepared by a nesting male. Small "sneaker" males hang out around the nest and dart in to release large amounts of sperm when a female is spawning. The females, however, seem to have found a way to thwart the sneaker males by giving an advantage to the nesting male's sperm.</p>
<p>"The sneaker males release more sperm than the nesting males, and you'd think that would give them a better chance to fertilize the eggs, but there is something in the ovarian fluid that removes that advantage," said first author Suzanne Alonzo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Quality over quantity</strong></p>
<p>Alonzo's team conducted fertilization experiments in petri dishes with and without ovarian fluid. Nesting males produce fewer but faster sperm than sneaker males, and the results showed that the presence of ovarian fluid tips the balance such that sperm quality matters more than quantity. The ovarian fluid does not appear to affect sperm from the different male types differently, but generally enhances how fast and straight the sperm swim and the strength of their attraction to the egg. The overall effect is to increase the relative importance of sperm velocity over sperm numbers.</p>
<p>A nesting male cares for the eggs in his nest regardless of the efforts of sneaker males, but the female still has good reasons to prefer that her eggs are fertilized by the nesting male. Nesting males are older and grow more quickly as juveniles than sneaker males, so they may have genetic traits that would be advantageous to their offspring.</p>
<p>"We know that the nesting males grow faster and have survived into their second year, so if either of those has a genetic basis it makes sense that females would prefer their offspring to carry those genes," Alonzo said.</p>
<p>In evolutionary terms, this means that by favoring nesting males, cryptic female choice in the ocellated wrasse can cause "directional selection" that influences the evolution of male traits. Other researchers studying chinook salmon have found that ovarian fluid can favor genetically compatible sperm, but have not shown directional selection.</p>
<p>"Directional selection is required for cryptic female choice to actually shape male traits," Alonzo said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Hidden interactions</strong></p>
<p>Research on cryptic female choice over the past ten to 20 years has revealed a range of surprising hidden interactions between the sexes in different species. For the many aquatic animals with external fertilization, however, those kinds of interactions had not seemed possible.</p>
<p>"These new results open up a whole new world of possibilities," Alonzo said. "When we think about why marine species look and act the way they do, part of what we are seeing depends on this cryptic level of interactions between males and females, or really between eggs and sperm. It makes sense that you would see these kinds of effects in the reproductive tract, but that it's happening in the water is pretty amazing."</p>
<p>In addition to Alonzo, the coauthors of the paper are Kelly Stiver at Southern Connecticut State University and Susan Marsh-Rollo at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>The three awards are out of 69 the AAUW granted nationwide this year and are the most UC Santa Cruz has received in a single year.</p>
<p>Winners of AAUW American Fellowships are <a href="http://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/fellowships_directory/#rid4028">Lizzy Hare</a>, anthropology; <a href="http://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/fellowships_directory/#rid4052">Anna Rosen</a>, astronomy and astrophysics; and <a href="http://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/fellowships_directory/#rid4057">Justine Smith</a>, environmental studies. The fellowships will provide support as the women complete their dissertations.</p>
<p>Hare conducted fieldwork for her dissertation in northwest Indiana, where she worked with ecological scientists and land managers to understand how competing narratives about the environment come to be made and how those narratives become ethical claims about what the landscape once was and what it could or should be in the future.</p>
<p>At UCSC, she has been an active member of the Science &amp; Justice Research Center, which supports innovative approaches to social justice through collaborative, interdisciplinary research.</p>
<div class="gmail_extra">Rosen&#8217;s research focuses on the formation of massive stars and how stellar feedback, the injection of energy and momentum by stars into their surroundings, affects star formation and environment. She has developed computational tools that have taken star formation simulations to the next level in complexity. She is also active in outreach and mentoring to increase diversity and retention in astrophysics.</div>
<p>Smith studies how humans alter ecosystem dynamics by influencing the behavior of predators. She works with the Santa Cruz Puma Project to investigate how humans induce fear responses in pumas, which indirectly affect puma prey and competitors. While at UCSC, she has mentored 43 undergraduate interns, given 25 public talks, created a local citizen science program, and founded the Santa Cruz chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology. (A photograph of Smith tracking pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains is one of the lead images on the <a href="http://www.aauw.org/">AAUW's web site</a>.)</p>
<p>American Fellowships are the AAUW&#8217;s oldest and largest funding program, dating back to 1888 and making them one of the oldest and most prestigious fellowships in the world exclusively for women. AAUW American Fellowships support women scholars who are completing doctoral dissertations, conducting postdoctoral research, or finishing research for publication.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long and proud history of supporting exceptional women scholars through our American Fellowship program,&#8221; said Gloria Blackwell, AAUW vice president of fellowships, grants, and global programs. "This year&#8217;s group includes women who are leaders in their institutions and their fields working on issues related to sexual violence, race, and other topics of importance to women and girls. They aren&#8217;t just brilliant, they are agents of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the 2016&#8211;2017 academic year, AAUW awarded $3.7 million to more than 230 scholars, research projects, and programs promoting education and equity for women and girls through six fellowships and grants programs. AAUW is one of the world&#8217;s leading supporters of graduate women&#8217;s education, having awarded more than $100 million in fellowships, grants, and awards to 12,000 women from more than 140 countries since 1888.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.aauw.org/</url><title>American Association of University Women</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="80cd537b8072701713dacb136c3fdb08"><name>obama-reading-list</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Book by UC Santa Cruz alumnus tops President Obama’s Summer Reading List</title><summary>A memoir of surfing by UC Santa Cruz graduate William Finnegan, (Cowell, '74, English literature) is at the top of President Obama's 2016 Summer Reading List.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, william finnegan, surfing news, New Yorker, president obama news, obama's 2016 summer reading list </keywords><start-date>1471040700000</start-date><display-name>Book by UC Santa Cruz alumnus tops President Obama’s 2016 Summer Reading List</display-name><path>/2016/08/obama-reading-list</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/obama-reading-list</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1471039753630</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1471040738931</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/Finnegan-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/Finnegan-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Finnegan-200.jpg</name><display-name>Finnegan-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>87121</file-size><width>200</width><height>297</height></image><image-alt>William Finnegan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/obama-reading-list-thumb-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/obama-reading-list-thumb-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>obama-reading-list-thumb-250.jpg</name><display-name>obama-reading-list-thumb-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>22089</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cover of book by William Finnegan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>William Finnegan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/barbarian days book cover-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/barbarian days book cover-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barbarian days book cover-200.jpg</name><display-name>barbarian days book cover-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>81632</file-size><width>200</width><height>296</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>A memoir of surfing by UC Santa Cruz graduate William Finnegan, (Cowell, &#8217;74, English literature) is at the top of President Obama&#8217;s 2016 Summer Reading List.<br/>
 <br/>
 The White House released the list today as the President vacationed with his family in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard.<br/>
 <br/>
 Finnegan&#8217;s book, <em>Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</em>, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in April for a biography or autobiography by an American author. It covers Finnegan&#8217;s obsession with waves in California and Hawaii&#8212;including his surfing days in the early 1970s while a student at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
 <br/>
 Describing Finnegan as a writer of rare subtlety and observational gifts, the <em>Washington Post</em> lauded the book as: &#8220;Terrific&#8230;elegantly written and structured, it&#8217;s a riveting adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, and a restless, searching meditation on love, friendship and family.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 And a S<em>an Francisco Chronicle</em> review called it an &#8220;An evocative, profound and deeply moving memoir&#8230;The proof is in the sentences. Were I given unlimited space to review this book, I would simply reproduce it here, with a quotation mark at the beginning and another at the end.&#8221;<br/>

<p>One set of grooves on Phobos are thought to be stress fractures resulting from the tidal pull of Mars. The new study, published August 30 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, addresses another set of grooves that do not fit that explanation.</p>
<p>"These grooves cut across the tidal fields, so they require another mechanism. If we put the two together, we can explain most if not all of the grooves on Phobos," said first author Michael Nayak, a graduate student in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Phobos is an unusual satellite, orbiting closer to its planet than any other moon in the solar system, with an orbital period of just 7 hours. Small and heavily cratered, with a lumpy nonspherical shape, it is only 9,000 kilometers from the surface of Mars (the distance from San Francisco to New York and back) and is slowly spiraling inward toward the planet. Phobos appears to have a weak interior structure covered by an elastic shell, allowing it to be deformed by tidal forces without breaking apart.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Tidal stresses</strong></p>
<p>Coauthor Erik Asphaug, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University and professor emeritus at UC Santa Cruz, has been studying Phobos for many years. Recent computer simulations by him and NASA planetary scientist Terry Hurford showed how tidal stresses can cause fracturing and linear grooves in the surface layer. Although this idea was first proposed in the 1970s, the existence of so many grooves with the wrong orientation for such stress fractures had remained unexplained.</p>
<p>Nayak developed computer simulations showing how those anomalous grooves could result from impacts. Material ejected from the surface by an impact easily escapes the weak gravity of Phobos. But the debris remains in orbit around Mars, most of it moving either just slower or just faster than the orbital velocity of Phobos, and within a few orbits it gets recaptured and falls back onto the surface of the moon.</p>
<p>Nayak's simulations enabled him to track in precise detail the fate of the ejected debris. He found that recaptured debris creates distinctive linear impact patterns that match the characteristics of the anomalous grooves and chains of craters that cut across the tidal stress fractures on Phobos.</p>
<p>"A lot of stuff gets kicked up, floats for a couple of orbits, and then gets recollected and falls back in a linear chain before it has a chance to be pulled apart and disassociated by Mars' gravity," Nayak said. "The controlling factor is where the impact occurs, and that determines where the debris falls back."</p>
<p>The researchers used their model to match a linear chain of small craters on Phobos to its primary source crater. They simulated an impact at the 2.6-kilometer crater called Grildrig, near the moon's north pole, and found that the pattern resulting from ejected debris falling back onto the surface in the model was a very close match to the actual crater chain observed on Phobos.</p>
<p>With its low mass and close orbit around Mars, Phobos is so unusual that it may be the only place in the solar system where this phenomenon occurs, Nayak said.</p>

<p>Phil Vandenberg, campus boating director for 35 years who retired in 2007, skippered&#160; &#8220;Maybe,&#8221; a Santana 22 that was donated to the UCSC sailing program, Joining him on the crew were Rusty Kingon, current boating supervisor, and Bob Simpkins, a longtime Santa Cruz sailor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe&#8221; and its three-man crew scored three second-place finishes among a field of 12 boats on the first day of sailing and two firsts on the second and final day to secure the championship over previous three-time champion &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Santana 22 class championships are held each year, rotating between Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco, said Kingon, who joined the UCSC sailing program in 2000 and became boating supervisor after Vandenberg&#8217;s retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe&#8221; is berthed at the UC Santa Cruz Community Boating Center located at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor. Santa Cruz sailing legend Ernie Rideout and his wife Nancy donated the boat that was built in 1964 to UCSC in 2011. Rideout won previous national championships on &#8220;Maybe,&#8221; including 2006 and 2008 at ages 88 and 90. He died last year at 98.</p>
<p>&#8220;This latest championship is a great tribute to Mr. Rideout,&#8221; Kingon said.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Community Boating Center offers sailing classes throughout the year to both students and the local community. Kingon said the program just completed a 10-week session of mini classes for faculty, staff, alumni, and community members. The UCSC fleet includes five keel boats, and FJ, Coronado, and Laser class boats.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://boating.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Community Boating Center  </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.tombentley.com/ErnieRideout.pdf</url><title>Article on the history of Maybe and Ernie Rideout </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="946e32418072701713dacb13bf9a9ce8"><name>summer-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduates exhibit summer research projects at annual symposium</title><summary>More than 100 student research projects were featured at the seventh annual Summer Research Symposium. </summary><keywords>Summer Research Symposium, undergraduate research, STEM Diversity Office</keywords><start-date>1471330800000</start-date><display-name>Undergraduates exhibit summer research projects at annual symposium</display-name><path>/2016/08/summer-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/summer-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1471369063147</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1471369829083</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/posters-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/posters-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>posters-425.jpg</name><display-name>posters-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>133847</file-size><width>425</width><height>282</height></image><image-alt>posters in courtyard</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/melawit-tekeste-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/melawit-tekeste-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melawit-tekeste-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>melawit-tekeste-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21527</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Melawit Tekeste</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>More than 100 posters were on display at the annual Summer Research Symposium.

<p>The U.S. Department of Education received 880 applications and awarded 459 Talent Search grants, providing $144 million in funding that will help more than 300,000 youth across 49 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau in gaining the skills needed to successfully graduate high school and prepare for college.</p>
<p>Talent Search, one of eight programs collectively known as the Federal TRIO Programs, connects disadvantaged youth and their families to high-quality tutoring services and counseling services to improve financial aid literacy and financial planning for postsecondary education.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Talent Search program is part of our commitment to support lower-income students in their aspirations to join the University of California,&#8221; said Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of Undergraduate Education. &#8220;I am particularly proud that the Educational Partnership Center&#8217;s excellence in facilitating opportunities for students has again been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am excited about the further expansion of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s collaborations with regional schools in San Jose to help students explore the possibilities of advanced education and student research on our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding will allow the Educational Partnership Center to serve 500 students from Lee Mathson Middle School in the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District; Bridges Academy in the Franklin-McKinley School District; and James Lick High School and Yerba Buena High School in the East Side Union High School District.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ensuring disadvantaged families have access to educational counseling services and better access to financial aid will put more people on a pathway to a good education to uplift themselves and their families,&#8221; Congressman Sam Farr said. &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to support this federal program that&#8217;s awarding UCSC this money and look forward to continuing doing everything I can to further increase access to postsecondary education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guided by current research, best practices, and a unified framework of academic preparation and a college readiness framework, the UC Santa Cruz Talent Search project will offer services in response to the demographic, socioeconomic, and educational needs of students and families in this high-need region. The project will provide students with an array of services, including academic tutoring, financial aid and scholarship application assistance, and postsecondary options workshops.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Talent Search funding continues the Educational Partnership Center&#8217;s focus on improving high school graduation and college-enrollment and attainment rates for low-income, first-generation college students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. This funding will allow us to help underrepresented students in Santa Clara County get on the path to college eligibility and realize their dream of graduating from college,&#8221; said Maria Rocha-Ruiz, executive director of the Educational Partnership Center. &#8220;We are looking forward to working with the targeted districts and schools to widen the impact and build upon the foundation of the work already achieved in some of these schools by our staff, further building upon the existing college-going community for students and their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lizbeth Leon, a first-generation student from San Jose&#8217;s Andrew Hill High School, credits a similar program&#8212;the <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/programs/cal-soap.html">California Student Opportunity and Access Program</a> (Cal-SOAP)&#8212;with helping her get to UC Santa Cruz. The program, run by the campus Educational Partnership Center, offered information about essays for the college application and for scholarships.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Cal-SOAP hadn&#8217;t been there I would have struggled much more,&#8221; said Leon, who plans to double major in sociology and art when she starts this fall. &#8220;It would have had a big impact on my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has recently been recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution, with 31 percent of undergraduates identifying as Hispanic or Latino backgrounds. The campus is also dedicated to students with financial need &#8211; 44 percent of undergraduates receive Pell grants, the federal government&#8217;s need-based program for low-income undergraduates.</p>
<p>The Educational Partnership Center, a program of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Undergraduate Education, coordinates new and longstanding student academic preparation efforts of UC Santa Cruz with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to postsecondary education for underrepresented students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. Through six vital programs (EAOP, MESA, COSMOS, Cal-SOAP, GEAR UP and the California Reading and Literature Project), and with support from federal and state funding, EPC provides an array of direct services which support students on the college-going pathway through tutoring, mentoring, academic planning and counseling, leadership training, test preparation, college awareness and enrichment, and teacher professional development.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="995fa61d8072701713dacb137105064e"><name>offensive-fliers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>More offensive fliers reported on networked printers</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating several reports today of offensive and anti-Semitic fliers being printed on networked campus printers, similar to instances earlier this month and in March.</summary><start-date>1471452000000</start-date><display-name>Offensive fliers</display-name><path>/2016/08/offensive-fliers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/offensive-fliers</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1471451996299</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1471452042493</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating several reports today of offensive and anti-Semitic fliers being printed on networked campus printers, similar to instances earlier this month and in March.</p>

Terry made many fundamental contributions to the design and construction of the Keck 10-meter Telescopes and made equally important contributions to initiation of the Thirty-Meter Telescope project. He was a valued colleague and good friend to many in the UC astronomy community and beyond.</p>
<p>Terry completed his undergraduate degree at Caltech in 1964 and his PhD in high-energy physics at UC Berkeley in 1971. As a graduate student he published six papers in the <em>Physical Review,</em> including two for which he was the first author. His early work was primarily in the area of characterizing the interesting new particles that were being discovered in accelerators, but he was lead author, with Jerry Nelson a coauthor, on papers describing techniques and early limits in searching for evidence of gravitational waves from pulsars and probing the origins of high-energy cosmic rays.</p>
<p>He worked as a research physicist at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley's Space Science Lab in areas as diverse as developing new particle detector technologies to measuring cosmic ray elemental abundances. In 1993 he moved from Berkeley to UC Santa Cruz as a research physicist at the University of California Observatories.</p>
<p>Among Terry's many papers in physics and astrophysics journals between 1968 and 1981 was a 1979 LBL Report and conference proceedings entitled &#8220;Figure Control for a Segmented Telescope Mirror&#8221; (Mast and Nelson). This foreshadowed the next 35 years of Terry&#8217;s career. A series of papers over the next 15 years investigated in great detail all aspects of building and controlling a 10-meter segmented-mirror primary mirror, including calculations of the effects of primary mirror segmentation on image quality, the design of edge sensors that could reliably work to a precision of a few nanometers in the conditions present in a telescope dome, solutions to challenges in fabricating off-axis segments, algorithms for aligning and phasing segments, and many other topics that had to be addressed in order for the Keck Observatory to be the world-changing success that it has been. His primary collaborators in these efforts were Jerry Nelson and Gary Chanan (UC Irvine).</p>
<p>Terry made a large number of other contributions to the instrumentation program at UC Santa Cruz and UC Observatories, and, when the opportunity was presented to consider the next step in giant telescopes, he worked on a number of fundamental concepts for the California Extremely Large Telescope that subsequently became the Thirty-Meter Telescope.</p>
<p>Terry&#8217;s great strengths were a very sophisticated command of the relevant mathematics and physics and a particularly clear and logical approach to defining and solving complex problems. He was well known for his imperturbable, even-tempered, and exceedingly pleasant manner.</p>
<p>In recent years, Terry had been slowed by multiple sclerosis. For those of us who have had the privilege to continue working with him, his approach to this challenge was inspiring. In the face of increasing difficulties, he continued his always careful and correct calculations and maintained his steady, optimistic approach. He will be greatly missed professionally and personally. He leaves a truly giant scientific legacy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Claire Max, Director of UC Observatories, and Michael Bolte, Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a7784a28072701713dacb135dc3ea5f"><name>island-extinctions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Most island vertebrate extinctions could be averted, concludes new study</title><summary>Control and eradication of invasive species could prevent as much as 75 percent of all island-level extinctions.</summary><keywords>Erin McCreless, Donald Croll, Island Conservation, invasive species</keywords><start-date>1471510800000</start-date><display-name>Most island vertebrate extinctions could be averted, concludes new study</display-name><path>/2016/08/island-extinctions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/island-extinctions</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1471470337814</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1472657622578</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Heath Packard, Island Conservation</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/ricords-iguana-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/ricords-iguana-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ricords-iguana-425.jpg</name><display-name>ricords-iguana-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>94688</file-size><width>425</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>Ricord's iguana</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/ricords-iguana-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/ricords-iguana-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ricords-iguana-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ricords-iguana-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23953</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ricord's iguana</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The critically endangered Ricord&#8217;s iguana, native to Cabritos Island, Dominican Republic, is one of the most threatened lizards in the world.

Currently, 40 percent of species at risk of global extinction are island inhabitants.</p>
<p>In the most thorough study of its kind, scientists have now analyzed global patterns of island vertebrate extinctions and developed predictive models to help identify places where conservation interventions will provide the greatest benefits to threatened island biodiversity.</p>
<p>Control and eradication of invasive species are effective conservation tools, but conservation scientists have lacked tools for identifying where these efforts will have the greatest impact. The new study, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160818/ncomms12488/full/ncomms12488.html">published August 18 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> and led by UC Santa Cruz researcher Erin McCreless, closes that gap.</p>
<p>Humans have introduced non-native rodents, destructive herbivores such as goats, and predators like feral cats and foxes to islands around the world. These novel disturbances decimate native island wildlife and change entire island ecosystems. At the same time, islands are hotspots of biodiversity and often support rare and unique species occurring nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Controlling invasive mammal populations, or removing them entirely from islands, is a highly effective tool for conserving island species and ecosystems, and such actions have contributed greatly to the recovery of many threatened island species. Conservation dollars are limited, however, and it is important that invasive mammal management efforts be focused on the islands where they will go the furthest toward conserving native island biodiversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until now, conservation scientists have chosen islands for invasive mammal management largely based on the need to protect a particular native species, or on broader assumptions about how native species are likely being affected,&#8221; McCreless said. For example, invasive rats are often eradicated on islands where they have been seen eating native birds and their chicks.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, as these conservation efforts increase globally, conservationists need to take a more strategic approach and choose islands based on a more complete, larger-scale understanding of how different invasive mammals affect native species on different types of islands around the world,&#8221; McCreless explained.</p>
<p>Are rats more likely to cause bird extinctions on smaller, colder, or wetter islands than on other types of islands? Are native reptiles more vulnerable to the impacts of pigs than to those of rats or cats, and on what kinds of islands are these impacts seen most strongly? Answering such questions can help scientists understand the nuances of invasive mammal impacts on islands worldwide, and then use this information to direct limited resources to the places where management efforts will have the greatest benefits for native species.</p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity database</strong></p>
<p>In the new paper, McCreless and colleagues fill in many of these knowledge gaps by analyzing the <a href="http://tib.islandconservation.org/">Threatened Island Biodiversity Database</a>, a recently developed, global dataset of threatened native species and invasive mammals on islands. &#8220;We analyzed, for the first time at such a large scale, global patterns of island vertebrate extinctions in relation to different types of invasive mammals and physical island conditions,&#8221; McCreless said.</p>
<p>The study included more than 1,200 globally threatened or extinct vertebrate species that live (or lived) on more than 1,000 islands around the world. The authors found that just a few types of invasive mammals &#8211; rats, cats, pigs, mongooses, and weasels &#8211; are most strongly associated with the extirpation of native species (island-level extinction).</p>
<p>Importantly, the study shows that the impacts of each mammal varied widely across both the type of native species being affected (native amphibians, birds, reptiles, or mammals) and the conditions of the islands on which they occurred.</p>
<p>The authors used modeling approaches to predict how removing invasive mammals on different islands could reduce extinction risk for threatened species. In one of many examples, they showed that removing invasive mammals from small, dry islands could halve the extirpation risk for threatened native birds and mammals, but doing so on large, wet islands may have less benefit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of information is critical for conservationists trying to decide where to spend limited funds,&#8221; said coauthor Donald Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Global threat</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the paper highlights the global degree of the threat from invasive mammals on islands and the potential of management efforts to mitigate these threats. &#8220;We were able to estimate that up to 45 percent of globally threatened vertebrate populations on islands may be extirpated in the absence of conservation interventions, but that targeted invasive mammal control and eradication could prevent 41 to 75 percent of these predicted future extirpations,&#8221; said McCreless. &#8220;That is critical knowledge for both conservationists and funders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Nick Holmes, science director of Island Conservation, said the study provides valuable guidance for conservation interventions by his and other groups. &#8220;This study is a valuable contribution for island restoration and conservation planning, and highlights the value of tackling invasive species challenges to prevent extinctions on islands,&#8221; Holmes said.</p>
<p>In addition to McCreless, Croll, and Holmes, the coauthors include David Huff at NOAA, Bernie Tershy and Dena Spatz at UC Santa Cruz, Stuart Butchart at BirdLife International, and Chris Wilcox at CSIRO, Australia.

<p>&#160;&#8220;The division is clearly doing very well despite a decrease in available grant funding from public agencies,&#8221; Kamieniecki said. &#8220;Our faculty are conducting fascinating, cutting-edge research on a wide variety of important topics. I am quite pleased about these results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kamieniecki said grant funding from many federal government agencies has decreased, and competition for grants has become fierce, especially in the social sciences. &#8220;Nevertheless, these funds are the life blood of important research efforts on campus,&#8221; he said. Grants support the collection, organization, and analysis of significant quantities of qualitative and quantitative data, provide faculty members with funds for travel, equipment purchases and lab maintenance, materials and supplies.</p>
<p>In addition, grant awards can include crucial financial assistance for graduate students. Kamieniecki said. &#8220;Such funding will be essential as we continue to increase the number of Ph.D. students in the division.&#8221;</p>
<p>During 2015-2016, the division submitted 142 grant proposals, seeking $41.3 million. The division was successful in landing 69 grants worth $7,643,109 up from 94 awards &#160;and $7.4 million and during 2014-2015.</p>
<p>Overall, faculty and researchers have been continuing the trend of pursuing larger, more complex grants across all the departments, Kamieniecki said.</p>

<p>Manganese is an essential element, required by the body in trace amounts. High levels of exposure can have neurotoxic effects, however, leading to a condition called "manganism" in adults exposed to manganese dust or fumes in mining, welding, and other industrial occupations.</p>
<p>Studies of children and adolescents have associated excess manganese in the diet with attention deficits, but confounding factors in those studies have made it impossible to show a cause and effect relationship. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder in children, but its cause remains unclear and probably involves many different factors.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/ehp258/">published in <em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em></a>, is the first study to establish a causal link between exposure to elevated manganese in the diet and attentional dysfunction in an animal model, according to senior author Donald Smith, professor of environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"There are many environmental and biological factors that have been associated with increased risk for attention deficits in children, so it's very challenging to understand which factors may actually contribute to or cause attention deficits," Smith said. "Our study clarifies the effects of a single environmental agent, and it allowed us to tease out the specific nature of the deficits it causes, which is extremely difficult if not impossible to do in human studies."</p>
<p><strong>Well water</strong></p>
<p>The most common source of exposure to excess manganese is drinking water from wells, because groundwater in some areas is naturally high in manganese. Soy-based infant formulas also have much higher levels of manganese than breast milk. The exposure levels used in the rat study were chosen to produce increases in manganese intake (relative to the normal intake of baby rats) comparable to the relative increases that would be experienced by infants and young children exposed to contaminated drinking water, soy-based formulas, or both.</p>
<p>The impairments seen in the exposed rats were comparable in magnitude to the attentional dysfunction seen in children with ADHD, Smith said. A <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2013.04.004">previous study</a> by Smith's lab found that manganese exposure also causes deficits in fine motor abilities in rats, and he noted that similar deficits in coordination and dexterity are often seen in children with ADHD.</p>
<p>In the new study, newborn rats were exposed to 0, 25, or 50 milligrams of manganese per kilogram of body weight per day, for either the first 21 days after birth or for the duration of the study (about six months). Behavioral testing for attention and impulsivity began when the rats were about 80 days old and continued six days a week for three months, using a well-accepted protocol. The animals were trained to focus their visual attention on a wall in the testing chamber with five ports and to respond to a brief flash of light within one port by poking their nose into that port. The researchers introduced distractions by delivering a puff of scented air into a different port within the test chamber.</p>
<p>"The odor-based distractor is very hard for the animals to ignore because they have very strong olfactory senses," Smith said. "With thousands of response trials over months of testing, we were able to obtain very detailed information to assess specific functions that we can compare to the assessments used for children."</p>
<p><strong>Selective attention</strong></p>
<p>The impairment caused by manganese exposure was most pronounced in the area of selective attention, assessed by response accuracy in the presence of a distracting odor. Deficits were also seen in other areas related to attention, but manganese exposure did not affect impulse control.</p>
<p>The results also showed that the susceptibility to manganese changed as the animals grew and matured. They were particularly sensitive to the neurotoxic effects during the early postnatal period, before weaning. According to Smith, the dependence of toxicity on the dose as well as the timing and duration of exposure is complicated for a substance like manganese that also has a beneficial biological function.</p>
<p>"The typical dose-response curve for biologically essential elements is U-shaped: too little is bad, too much is bad, and you want to be somewhere in the middle. This study shows that vulnerability also changes over the course of neurodevelopment," he explained.</p>
<p>In the experiment, the rats got a constant dose relative to their body weight, but their sensitivity to it changed as they aged. At the lower dose level (25 mg/kg/d), animals exposed throughout the study actually showed less impairment than those exposed only during the early postnatal period. At the higher dose level, the level of impairment from the longer exposure was the same as the effects of the early life exposure.</p>
<p>"The lower dose exposure over the early life period produced lasting deficits in attention, but if that same dose was continued into adulthood, it helped lessen the deficits caused by the earlier exposure. At the higher dose, however, they were unable to recover," Smith said.</p>
<p>He noted that such complex responses to differences in dose, timing, and duration of exposure may underlie the inconsistencies in published studies of the relationship between blood levels of manganese in humans and neurobehavioral deficits.</p>
<p>"It's difficult if not impossible to reconstruct the exposure histories of children," Smith said. "If we knew their exposure histories more thoroughly, we would likely find stronger associations with the neurobehavioral deficits."</p>
<p>In addition to Smith, the authors of the study include first author Stephane Beaudin, a research scientist in Smith's lab at UC Santa Cruz, and Barbara Strupp and Myla Strawderman at Cornell University.

<p>The essay <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/expand-the-frontiers-of-urban-sustainability-1.20459">&#8220;Expand the Frontiers of Urban Sustainability"</a> calls on mainstream urban research and policy practice to broaden conceptions of sustainability socially and spatially. They recommend incorporating more spatially extensive measures of sustainability into research and planning and bringing social equity into the heart of sustainability research, planning, and policy implementation.</p>
<p>Angelo, who joined UC Santa Cruz a year ago, wrote the piece with colleagues David Wachsmuth of McGill University and Daniel Aldana Cohen of the University of Pennsylvania. It is the lead commentary in <em>Nature&#8217;s</em> opinion section and appears online and in the August 25 print edition<em>.</em></p>
<p>The authors note that although cities were once seen as sustainability problems rather than solutions, this changed as concerns over suburban sprawl, shanty towns, and climate change grew. In recent years, awareness has grown that clustering people in energy-efficient buildings and walkable, shady neighborhoods can make cities more pleasant places to live and better for the global environment.</p>
<p>But true sustainability requires more than energy efficiency and walkability, they write. &#8220;Focusing on dense cities and their affluent areas ignores social movements and their advocacy for quality-of-life issues such as housing and commuting, which have direct ecological consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angelo and her co-authors call for expanding urban planning beyond individual neighborhoods and even municipalities to larger regions. &#8220;Sustainability research and policymaking should shift focus from city centers to urban regions and global networks of production, consumption and distribution,&#8221; they suggest. In addition, &#8220;socially, policymakers should incorporate equity into every stage of the urban-policy process, from research to formulation to implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angelo is an urban sociologist who studies interactions between social understandings of nature and processes of urbanization. Before beginning her Ph.D. at NYU, she worked with the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation for five years on issues of participatory design and immigration and public space use.</p>
<p>In the coming academic year at UCSC, she will teach Classical Social Theory and Sociology of Knowledge, which will include studies of climate change and sustainability.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nature.com/news/expand-the-frontiers-of-urban-sustainability-1.20459</url><title>"Expand the Frontiers of Urban Sustainability'</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b94e64ea8072701713dacb13842d8069"><name>stamp-book-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Film professor Shelley Stamp wins 2015 book award from Theatre Library Association </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp has been honored with a 2015 Book Award from The Theatre Library Association.

 <br/>
 Stamp&#8217;s book, <strong><a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520284463"><em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em></a></strong> (published by University of California Press), was awarded the&#160;2015&#160;Richard Wall Award Special Jury Prize for an exemplary work in the field of recorded performance. <br/>
 <br/>
 The awards ceremony will be held this October in New York City. <br/>
 <br/>
 <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em> was published last April, and it was named one of the best film books of 2015 by the <em>Huffington Post</em>. Last December, Stamp traveled to Hollywood to present a lecture about the book at the <a href="http://www.oscars.org/about"><em><strong>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 One of&#160;the most prolific directors of the silent film era, Weber was a writer, producer, actress, and head of her own production company, who paved the way for filmmakers who envisioned film as an opportunity to inject their own ideas and philosophies into a rapidly growing entertainment industry. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Her work is incredibly interesting because she wrote and directed popular narratives in the 1910s that took on controversial subjects of the day--poverty, addiction, capital punishment, and the fight to legalize birth control,&#8221; said Stamp. &#8220;She believed cinema was a &#8216;voiceless language&#8217; capable of presenting these issues for a mass audience, a new medium on par with a newspaper's editorial page.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 A leading expert on women and early film culture, Stamp is interested in tracing the contributions women made to early Hollywood as filmmakers, moviegoers, performers, critics and theorists. Her main areas of expertise include Hollywood history, silent cinema, female filmmakers and movie audiences, movie censorship and ratings, and the history of going to the movies. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Stamp has served as a consultant for the National Film Preservation Foundation, EYE Film Institute Netherlands, Turner Classic Movies, and the American Movie Classics cable channel.&#160;Her expert commentary has appeared on several DVD releases of rare silent films. <br/>
 <br/>
 She is also the founding editor of <strong><a href="http://fmh.ucpress.edu"><em>Feminist Media Histories: An International Journal</em></a></strong>, and&#160;is currently at work on a comprehensive history, &#8220;Women and the Silent Screen in America.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b975e4868072701713dacb139a277d4c"><name>falcon-anzaldua-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Professor's book wins National Women's Studies Association book award</title><summary>A book by Sylvanna M.

Falc&#243;n, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, has been named winner of the 2016 Gloria E. Anzald&#250;a book prize given by the National Women&#8217;s Studies Association.</p>
<p><em>In</em> <em>Power Interrupted: Antiracist and Feminist Activism Inside the United Nations</em> (University of Washington Press, 2016) Falc&#243;n argues that solving racism requires multiple perspectives and shows how transnational feminist activism can offer nuance to important global issues.</p>
<p>Falc&#243;n joined UC Santa Cruz in 2010 after a two-year UC Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Women's Studies Department at UC Riverside. In 2008 she testified at the United Nations in Geneva about sexual violence against migrant women at the U.S.-Mexico border and served as a co-consultant to the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women in 2010.</p>
<p>The book award honors feminist and writer Anzald&#250;a, a one-time lecturer in feminist studies at UC Santa Cruz and a long-active member of the National Women's Studies Association.&#160;Anzald&#250;a was also a UCSC graduate student in literature who was awarded her Ph.D. posthumously after her death in 2004 at age 61.</p>
<p>The Anzald&#250;a award is for "groundbreaking monographs in women's studies that makes significant multicultural feminist contributions to women of color/transnational scholarship.&#8221; It will be presented at the NWSA conference in Montreal in November.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/falcon-power-interrupted.html   </url><title>Previous coverage </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/FALPOW.html</url><title>"Power Interrupted: Antiracist and Feminist Activism Inside the United Nations"</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b9a7f3538072701713dacb1366f03d30"><name>alumni-weekend-2016-storycruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>StoryCruz: Alumni Weekend 2016</title><summary>Alumni Weekend revelers tell their UC Santa Cruz stories, reminiscing about their student days and reflecting on how college set the stage for their lives and careers.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Hundreds of UC Santa Cruz alumni came back to school in April, but without having to cram for exams, write essays, or worry about grades.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">They came for <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/">Alumni Weekend</a>&#8212;a time to reconnect with UC Santa Cruz and each other, enjoy good conversation, attend fascinating lectures (without taking notes!), participate in events and reunions, and reminisce on green fields overlooking the Monterey Bay.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/sets/storycruz"><strong>StoryCruz,</strong></a> UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s oral storytelling project, caught a few alumni and asked them to tell their UC Santa Cruz stories as they milled about College Eight after an al fresco lunch.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anthony Palavi</strong> <span>(Oakes '13, economics and environmental studies, minor electrical engineering) of Santa Cruz, who is currently working on a masters in applied economics and finance, said he was very unfocused academically &#8220;because I just wanted to do everything!&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Among his best memories was participating in the program that allows students to study renewable energy in Denmark (the the Denmark-California Renewable Energy Summer Program).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is very involved not only at the community level but at the global level,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Diana Alfaro</strong> <span>(College Ten '11, politics and Latin American and Latino studies) of Santa Cruz had decided to pursue law, but when she went to a mini law forum, she realized the field was not for her.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"I was a very lost student for awhile,&#8221; she said. But a new passion arose.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I really fell in love with my major of Latino studies, and I tried to find something in that field," she said. She found a job in affordable housing, which has become a career.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Karyn Sapon Anderson</strong> <span>(Stevenson '82, history), originally from New York, told an entertaining story about some words of advice she got from a chance meeting with then&#8211;Gov. Jerry Brown (during his second term) directing her to UC Santa Cruz over other UCs as she and her father traveled the state to tour colleges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"I fell in love with the campus &#8230; my dad was completely comfortable with me going to such a great location, a very safe environment, with the recommendation of the governor of California!" said Sapon Anderson. "I wound up coming to California and going to UC Santa Cruz and literally had the best four years of my life."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Caitlin Freeman</strong> <span>(Kresge '97 photography) of San Francisco is the resident pastry chef for Blue Bottle Coffee, founded by husband</span> <strong>James Freeman</strong> <span>(Stevenson '90, philosophy)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Inspired to bake by the confectionary paintings of California painter Wayne Thiebaud, Caitlin decided to re-create those very cakes when Blue Bottle opened a caf&#233; in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). Many art-inspired desserts later, she wrote the book</span> <em>Modern Art Desserts.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;My college years were more about finding myself, kind of this extended growing up,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She cited photography lecturer Ingeborg Gerdes (who retired in 2006) as among her most influential teachers. "She really had us out of the classroom a lot and we spent a lot of time in San Francisco going to galleries, and spent a lot of time at the SFMOMA."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>James said he was &#8220;a dilettante,&#8221; focused on playing clarinet.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I was a spotty student,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had moments of triumph and then moments of mediocrity. But I learned a lot about clarity of thought and clarity of expression.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He didn't realize it wasn't very common to have that purity of expression when he started the business of Blue Bottle Coffee, he said. Blue Bottle now has 25 stores, including three in Tokyo, and more than 600 employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I think that's really helped me not be tethered too much to these dreary practicalities. I could focus on what I thought was pure and beautiful and not realize that there were other options,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;What would you wish for her in an education at UC Santa Cruz?&#8221; asked Caitlin, referring to their 9-month-old daughter happily snuggling against mom in a baby carrier.</span></p>

The misty reasons behind the diversity of California&#8217;s fragile coastal chaparral. An assessment of the latest efforts to predict earthquakes by catching unusual electrical patterns in the ground &#8212; or in the sky.</p>
<p>These are among the stories in <a href="http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2016"><em>Science Notes 2016</em></a>, the illustrated online magazine published annually by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://scicom.ucsc.edu/">Science Communication Program</a>.</p>
<p>The class of 2016 ventured across the state to join teams at work. To the south, researchers revisit the same Death Valley sites charted by pioneering naturalists a century ago to gauge how climate change has affected desert ecosystems. To the west, fire scientists examine why Sierra Nevada forests have become explosively combustible &#8212; and how to lower the risks. To the north, ecologists track families of river otters to determine why the playful animals have returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after an absence of decades. And offshore, ocean scientists probe the sea&#8217;s microbiome, which controls marine life in wholly unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Multimedia elements enhance each story. A veteran biomolecular engineer feels he is on the verge of developing the first effective HIV vaccine, using an approach detailed in a podcast and an explanatory graphic. Wildlife biologists share images from motion-activated cameras that reveal where and how animals get past highways crossing a vital open space. And a famous lab at UCSF explores the tangled origins of a rare neurodegenerative disease &#8212; a story featuring a forthright interview with a longterm survivor.</p>
<p>Several of the stories focus on work by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, including biomolecular engineers David Deamer and Mark Akeson (nanopore sequencer); ocean scientist Jonathan Zehr (marine microbiology); biomolecular engineer Phil Berman (HIV vaccine); and the Arboretum's Brett Hall (coastal chaparral).</p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s fifteen original illustrations come from the talented artists in the Science Illustration Program at CSU Monterey Bay, directed by Ann Caudle. Gordy Slack advised the writers as consulting editor, along with friend of the program Ellen Chu. Molly Bentley provided podcast instruction, while Mary Miller (class of 1990) and Lisa Strong ('93) guided the photos and slideshows. Each story also displays data through an infographic, mentored by graphics director Pai from the San Jose Mercury News. The online publication was produced by web designer Barbara McKenna of <a href="http://gallery-b.net/">Gallery B</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://scicom.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Science Communication Program</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be1753628072701713dacb133b3b0817"><name>admissions-events</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Admissions Events for Prospective Students</title><summary>Key event dates targeting prospective undergraduates who will be applying for fall 2017.</summary><start-date>1472022000000</start-date><display-name>Admissions Events for Prospective Students</display-name><path>/2016/08/admissions-events</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/admissions-events</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1472068013306</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1472068147561</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As you prepare for this upcoming academic year, I want to share some key event dates targeting prospective undergraduates who will be applying for fall 2017. For many years, the Office of Admissions has offered a campus event called &#8220;Preview Day,&#8221; a fall open house that involved the entire campus community. Over the past couple of years, our analysis of this event has led us to the decision to forgo our traditional plan and transition to smaller scale, tour-focused events that we will offer on two Saturdays, one in late October and one in early November. These events will not require the same campus-wide participation as in the past, which I&#8217;m sure comes as welcome news to those of you who have been involved in Preview Day in the past. <br/>
 <br/>
 These Saturday tours will include an Admissions overview presentation, student panel, and student-led campus tour. We believe this new format will better meet our guests' expectations, especially with so many competing weekend events at California colleges/universities.<br/>
 <br/>
 In addition, we will re-focus our energies on increasing outreach throughout California and beyond, and on continuing to provide online engagement opportunities to students throughout the academic year. We will also continue to offer our annual Spring Spotlight program (a yield event targeting admitted students and their families) in April 2017. I would ask you to hold April 8, 2017 and April 15, 2017 to participate in this important yield effort. <br/>
 <br/>
 Spring Spotlight will continue to include a campus resource fair, residential room viewing tours, and other campus-based events. We look forward to working with campus partners to provide diverse, interactive academic and campus visit opportunities. <br/>
 <br/>
 As a campus, UCSC welcomes over 35,000 visitors during an academic year, including many who travel from another state or another country. Our campus is definitely on a lot of students&#8217; short list these days, and we should all be proud of that fact, but I also recognize that this increasing interest can add to the daily burdens of our faculty, students, and staff. I thank you for the important role you play in responding to these visitors. <br/>
 <br/>
 If you have questions regarding these upcoming events, please contact Assistant Director Beatrice Atkinson-Myers in the Office of Admissions (<a href="beatrice@ucsc.edu">beatrice@ucsc.edu</a> or 459-2352). In the meantime, here is a summary of our planned events for 2016-17: <br/>
 <strong><br/>
</strong> <strong>Fall Saturday Tours (replacing our annual Preview Day event)</strong><br/>
 &#160;<strong><br/>
</strong> <strong>October 29, 2016 and November 12, 2016</strong><br/>
 This student-led campus tour event will provide prospective students with a general introduction to academic and campus opportunities. An Admissions presentation covering freshman and transfer admissions will be followed by a brief student panel and an all-walking campus tour.&#160; <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <strong>Spring Spotlight</strong><br/>
 Friday, April 7 - Saturday, April 15, excluding Sunday, April 9, 2017<br/>

 Again, I thank you for your commitment and continued partnership in welcoming and yielding the best students for the UCSC community!</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Michael McCawley, Director of Admissions</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c33bbe4f8072701713dacb13334b9a7d"><name>community-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Connect with city leadership at community forum</title><summary>City Hall to You provides an opportunity for community dialogue with city leaders and staff on neighborhood-specific topics.</summary><keywords>city council, government, residents</keywords><start-date>1472144400000</start-date><display-name>Community forum</display-name><path>/2016/08/community-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/community-forum</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1472154286299</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1472154494740</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The City of Santa Cruz welcomes Westside/Upper Westside residents and business owners to a <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/cityhalltoyou">&#8220;City Hall to You&#8221;</a> community forum from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 31 at Peace United Church of Christ, 900 High St.</p>
<p>The event provides an opportunity for community dialogue with city leaders and staff on neighborhood-specific topics. Individuals are encouraged to voice their ideas and concerns and ask questions during an open house of city department displays and town hall presentation by city leaders.</p>
<p>The event is the third in a quarterly series created by the City Council to enhance community connectedness and government transparency. There will be 20 displays regarding city projects and programs relevant to the Westside including the Coastal Rail Trail, details of neighborhood locations in the new Citywide Safe Routes-to-School Crossing Improvement Program, and an interactive police department neighborhood map for citizens to point out their concerns and issues.</p>
<p>Attendees will also be able to contribute their ideas for the Rail Trail Arts Masterplan in an interactive display of the 5-mile trail segment that will run through Santa Cruz. At the Fire Department and Office of Emergency Services booth, residents can sign up for free Community Emergency Response Training and talk with instructor and recent program graduate. The Police Department table offers help for anyone interested in registering their bike in the new online program with free decal upon completed registration. Mayor Cynthia Mathews and Councilmember David Terrazas will host a booth detailing the City&#8217;s upcoming month-long 150th anniversary celebration and a UC Santa Cruz table will offer Good Neighbor Initiative program information.</p>
<p>Midway through the forum there will be a 30-minute presentation by Vice Mayor Cynthia Chase, Assistant Public Works Director/City Engineer Chris Schneiter, Police Chief Kevin Vogel, and City Manager Mart&#237;n Bernal followed by a 30-minute question and answer period. This town hall portion of the event will focus on public safety issues and upcoming Westside Public Works projects including Bay Street Road Safety Improvements, Measure H paving, the Coastal Rail Trail, Safe Routes-to-School crossing improvements, and Bay and High streets intersection improvements.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c3f991558072701713dacb13fe9fb3f7"><name>daniel-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Charles Daniel (1933–2016)</title><summary>Charles Daniel, professor emeritus of biology and a founding faculty member, died in Berkeley on August 10.</summary><keywords>Charles Daniel</keywords><start-date>1472194800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Charles Daniel (1933–2016)</display-name><path>/2016/08/daniel-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/daniel-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1472166726579</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1481059856417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/charles-daniel-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/charles-daniel-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>charles-daniel-300.jpg</name><display-name>charles-daniel-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>55747</file-size><width>300</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Charles Daniel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/08/images/charles-daniel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/08/images/charles-daniel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>charles-daniel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>charles-daniel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16833</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Charles Daniel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Charles Daniel, professor emeritus of biology and a founding faculty member at UC Santa Cruz, died in Berkeley on Wednesday, August 10. He was 83.</p>
<p>Daniel was a distinguished biologist whose research focused on cell physiology, tumor biology, and aging. His work contributed to the understanding of how mammary tissues develop and the genetic and hormonal factors involved in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Daniel and another fellow of Cowell College, history professor Page Smith, published <em>The Chicken Book</em> in 1975, decades before backyard chickens became trendy. Reprinted in 2000, the book had its origins in a course Daniel and Smith taught together in 1972, and it encompassed everything from chicken biology and behavior to the chicken's role in literature and history.</p>
<p>A long-serving chair of the biology department at UC Santa Cruz, Daniel also served as dean of graduate studies and acting associate academic vice chancellor. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Natural Sciences in 1994. He earned his B.A. in literature and mathematics at the University of New Mexico, M.S. in zoology at the University of Hawaii, and Ph.D. in zoology at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Daniel is survived by his sister, Laura Powers, children Paul, Matthew, and Carla Daniel, and six grandchildren.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs Office</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c8738af28072701713dacb136b404818"><name>recent-burglaries</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin: Recent burglaries and thefts</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating a rash of burglaries and thefts, and is seeking the community's help.</summary><start-date>1472194800000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin: Recent burglaries and thefts</display-name><path>/2016/08/recent-burglaries</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/08/recent-burglaries</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1472241829219</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1472241829219</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>
<div>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating a rash of burglaries and thefts, and is seeking the community's help.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The department has received several reports of burglaries from residents at The Villages and on Hagar Court. A suspect is described as a 5-foot, 10-inch, white man with short blond hair who is between 25 and 30 years old He was wearing shorts and carrying a large backpack.</div>
<div></div>
<div>These reports coincided with a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/village-burglaries.html">series of auto burglaries</a> at The Villages.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, campus police officers are investigating two thefts reported this morning. Between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., a backpack was stolen from the College 9 R5 office building, and just after 8 a.m., a bicycle was stolen from a porch at Family Student Housing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone with information regarding any of these cases is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department immediately. The community is also encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity or persons by dialing 911 or 831-459-2231, ext. 1.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Report all in-progress crimes by calling 911 from any landline or cell phone. Reports may also be made by using one of the many "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Safety Tips</strong></div>
<div>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Report all suspicious persons, in-progress crimes, and emergencies to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911.&#160;</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;</li>
<li>Whenever possible, please remember to lock your vehicle and residence doors. Keep valuables secured and out of sight.&#160;</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;</li>
<li>Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.&#160;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Campus Resources</strong></div>
<div>For students, a range of support services is also available through the Cowell Student Health Center, including personal counseling through Counseling and Psychological Services and support through a Confidential Victim Advocate.

href="http://www.neh.gov"><em><strong>National Endowment for the Humanities</strong></em></a> to plan and implement changes to graduate education that will broaden the career preparation of a Ph.D. student beyond a career in the academy.<br/>
 <br/>
 The <em>UC Santa Cruz Next Generation Humanities Ph.D. Planning Grant</em> is part of a major effort launched by the NEH to transform the culture of graduate education, tackling the issue of how Ph.D. students who immerse themselves deeply in graduate humanities research and writing can look to apply their skills and experience beyond teaching and professor positions to a broader range of careers.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The academic-focused future we&#8217;re accustomed to training graduate students for is disappearing,&#8221; said NEH Chairman William D. Adams. &#8220;If graduate programs wish to make a case for the continuation of graduate education in the humanities, they&#8217;re going to have to think about the professional futures of their students in entirely different ways.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 UC Santa Cruz Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Tyrus Miller noted that the Next Generation Humanities Ph.D. grant program represents a new focus for the National Endowment for the Humanities.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Through the Next Generation grants, the NEH is seeking to catalyze creativity and positive change at a pivotal point: the training of doctoral students in the cultural fields,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;They are encouraging faculty, staff, and administrators involved in graduate education--along with leaders outside of the university--to explore how humanities Ph.D.s might have more impact on public culture and public institutions.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The recipients of the Next Generation grants are a distinguished set of research universities, both public and private, across the United States,&#8221; added Miller. &#8220;The awardees will form a consortium, sharing ideas and best practices. It&#8217;s an honor and a sign of our recognized distinction in the Humanities that UC Santa Cruz was selected for a planning grant.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Miller will be the director of the project funded by the $25,000 matching NEH grant, working in collaboration with the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute for Humanities Research</strong></em></a> at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The NEH grant will help UC Santa Cruz adapt to the new landscape of the humanities in the United States, both inside and outside of the university,&#8221; Miller noted. &#8220;The challenges of the current political environment and the academic job-market for humanities Ph.Ds. are real, as is the unsettled place of culture in a technology- and business-obsessed global society. But the NEH is betting that our humanities doctoral students and faculty are up to that challenge, and that they can continue to provide invaluable historical, ethical, cultural, and linguistic insight into our contemporary situation.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Miller emphasized that the NEH grant is a planning grant, designed to support a year-long process developing ideas and initiatives to be shared with the Next Generation consortium and eventually with the broader public.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Our planning efforts will be a genuine multi-partner collaboration, involving the Division of Graduate Studies, the Humanities Division, the Institute for Humanities Research, the UC Santa Cruz Libraries, the Alumni Association, and other entities on and off campus,&#8221; said Miller. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We will also, of course, use the results of our planning to implement new ideas generated in the process and to seek additional grant funding for longer-term institutional change,&#8221; he added. <br/>
 <br/>
 A principal part of the funding will additionally support a graduate student researcher associated with the project, who will help to coordinate it and provide input as a graduate student participant on the planning committee. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Our graduate researcher will be Laura Cisneros of the History of Consciousness Ph.D. program, whose background in law offers a perspective and set of experiences in another field presently undergoing rapid change and adapting to a new professional context,&#8221; said Miller. <br/>
 <br/>
 The planning committee will also work with the Alumni Association to use its Career Alumni Network as a mentoring and professional development resource for Humanities Ph.Ds.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We will be bringing to Santa Cruz selected Ph.D. alumni who have pursued a variety of career paths in government, administration, and cultural institutions,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;These alumni will provide input to our planning process and share their experiences, informing us about how their doctoral training did or did not prepare them for their professional paths.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We will also be developing syllabi for a set of professional course modules that students can take to supplement their regular degree-program course work and broaden their career opportunities--particularly for professional employment outside of the academy,&#8221; he added.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d84364938072701713dacb13feb3acce"><name>casfs-apprenticeship-2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Organic farming and gardening training program accepts applications in 50th year </title><summary>Aspiring organic farmers and gardeners are invited to apply for the 2017 apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

He was 68.</p>
<p>In 1973, Shoemaker first began working as a lecturer and clinical supervisor for an undergraduate peer counseling program at Merrill College. Later, in his long career with UCSC's Counseling and Psychological Services, he was instrumental in establishing an American Psychological Association-approved internship and post-doctoral training program.</p>
<p>As a clinical supervisor and counseling psychologist, he was also very active in promoting cultural sensitivity and cross-cultural competency and even taught a class on "white identity in a multi-cultural society." He retired in 2007.</p>
<p>Shoemaker completed an undergraduate degree at San Francisco State in psychology in 1969 and received his Ph.D. in psychology from Alliant International University in 1973.</p>
<p>He maintained a private practice from 1977-2015 at his Aptos home and was a volunteer for the American Red Cross.
