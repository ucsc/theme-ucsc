<p>Summer is the perfect time for smaller class sizes and a peaceful atmosphere. There are more than 250 courses ranging from creative writing, to medical Spanish, to geography of national parks, and anything UC Santa Cruz students need to graduate.</p>
<p>This year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development. Students and staff can enroll up until the first day of classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer is a unique time when classes are open to everyone,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Staff, community members, high school students eager to start their college education, and students from other universities can take advantage of this fabulous campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>With multiple sessions, summer allows ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun.</p>

Amherst President Biddy Martin will deliver the address during the ceremony, and Faber and the other honorees will speak in a series of public conversations.</p>
<p>A professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, Faber is known for her pioneering research on the formation and evolution of galaxies, distant galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe. She is also a leading authority on telescopes and astronomical instrumentation and has been closely involved with both the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Among her many contributions to astronomy is the Faber-Jackson relation, the first known structural scaling law for galaxies&#8212;in this case, the relation between the mass of a galaxy and the speed of stars that orbit within it. In addition, Faber&#8217;s work has uncovered huge irregularities in the expansion of the universe caused by the perturbing effects of gravity from superclusters of galaxies. With colleagues, she used the Hubble Space Telescope to penetrate the cores of galaxies, revealing massive black holes at their centers. She has led major efforts with both Hubble and Keck to survey thousands of distant galaxies to characterize and document the evolution of galaxies over the history of the universe.</p>
<p>Faber, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1972, holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics from Swarthmore and a Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard. She has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the National Medal of Science, the Franklin Institute's Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science, and two awards for lifetime scientific achievement, the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the Russell Prize of the American Astronomical Society. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and American Philosophical Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6464ceb48072701713dacb13be93be20"><name>smith-society-storycruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>StoryCruz: A feeling of home</title><summary>The founder of UC Santa Cruz's Smith Renaissance Society talks with two alumni of the group about their experiences and moving on to his next project.</summary><keywords>Founder of UC Santa Cruz's Smith Renaissance Society talks with two alumni of the group about their experiences and moving on to his next project</keywords><start-date>1462345200000</start-date><display-name>StoryCruz: A feeling of home</display-name><path>/2016/05/smith-society-storycruz</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/smith-society-storycruz</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1461973207383</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462380132867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwendolyn Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/262371157&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width>460</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/smith-storycruz.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/smith-storycruz.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>smith-storycruz.jpg</name><display-name>smith-storycruz.jpg</display-name><file-size>52297</file-size><width>404</width><height>604</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/smith-storycruz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/smith-storycruz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>smith-storycruz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>smith-storycruz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3228</file-size><width>84</width><height>84</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Smith alumni ("Smithies") Kimbo Butcher (Porter '15, art), left, and Vanessa Reidel (Oakes '14, psychology), right, with&#160;Smith Renaissance Society founder Bill Dickinson.

<p>After 17 years of guiding and fundraising for the program, Dickinson (Cowell '68, philosophy) is handing off full responsibility to a board, led by president Shawn Cervantes (Oakes '13, psychology), and stepping into the background while he launches a new project.</p>
<p>In conversation with Smith alumni ("Smithies") Kimbo Butcher (Porter '15, art) and Vanessa Reidel (Oakes '14, psychology) for UC Santa Cruz's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/sets/storycruz">StoryCruz project</a>, Dickinson describes how he started the society and his feelings at this emotional juncture as he moves into his next chapter.</p>
<p>Letting go of Smith is "really uncomfortable," he said. "I suppose I'm going through what parents go through with kids, which is, maybe it isn't going to be quite what I had in mind, and that's got to be OK, but boy it is hard."</p>
<p>Dickinson recalls that he started the program as a living memorial to Page Smith, the historian and founding Cowell College provost, and his artist wife, Eloise.</p>
<p>The Smiths had been instrumental in Dickinson's growth as a young adult. Having grown up in an orphanage and foster homes, going on his own when he was 16, Dickinson was one of the first students to arrive on the new UC Santa Cruz campus in 1965.</p>
<p>"The Smiths, together with the caring, competent, committed community they gathered, helped me make my way forward to an adult life of which I feel pretty proud," said Dickinson. "That is what we try to offer our students."</p>
<p>The Smith Renaissance Society, as it's now known, is remarkably successful&#8212;the graduation rate of alumni, called Smith Collegiate Fellows, is higher than the UC and UC Santa Cruz average.</p>
<p>For Reidel and Butcher, the program Dickinson started provided the family they'd never had.</p>
<p>"It's a place where I don't have to ever say who I was," said Reidel. "It's the ability to be me, and everything that I am, and not my past."</p>
<p>"Even though I still don't have a family, every time I go to a Smith event, I know there's a family there," said Butcher. "It's kind of like a time to catch up and feel at home."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/storycruz-colemans.html</url><title>StoryCruz: Bittersweet moment</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="730953c38072701713dacb13bc1124f5"><name>scotts-valley-center</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UC Santa Cruz establishing Scotts Valley Center</title><summary>I am excited to announce that UC Santa Cruz will be establishing a center in Scotts Valley to support 500 staff from three divisions: Business and Administrative Services, Information Technology Services, and University Relations.</summary><start-date>1462172400000</start-date><display-name> UC Santa Cruz establishing Scotts Valley Center</display-name><path>/2016/05/scotts-valley-center</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/scotts-valley-center</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1462218870254</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462308879283</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I am excited to announce that UC Santa Cruz will be establishing a center in Scotts Valley to support 500 staff from three divisions: Business and Administrative Services, Information Technology Services, and University Relations. We will be calling it the UC Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley Center.<br/>
 <br/>
 UC Santa Cruz has signed a 20-year lease for two three-floor modules at the Enterprise Technology Centre in Scotts Valley. As you may recall, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/scotts-valley-office-space.html">the campus announced in early 2015</a> that it was exploring this idea. <br/>
 <br/>
 Though the timeline for the move has not yet been established, we hope to complete the relocations by the end of this year.<br/>
 <br/>
 No doubt this news is generating a lot of questions, and we're already trying to provide answers to commonly asked questions. Additionally, you can visit <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley">news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley</a> to learn more about the new Scotts Valley Center. I know the vice chancellors of each division are working to make sure the move and its timing are as minimally disruptive as possible, though moves like this are always challenging in some ways.<br/>
 <br/>
 A committee of staff members from all three divisions continues to meet weekly to help facilitate the process, make sure questions are being answered and problems are being solved. <br/>
 <br/>
 Additionally, a transportation survey will be sent out in the coming weeks to employees within the three divisions. <br/>
 <br/>
 This will be a big change for the campus, and it&#8217;s one I&#8217;m convinced will be worth the near-term interruption. Not only will this move create more academic and research-oriented space at 2300 Delaware Ave., but there are tangible benefits to housing staff from these three divisions together. The lease is a good deal for our campus. In addition to consolidating several leases, there will be opportunities for increased collaboration resulting from having a critical mass of employees together, rather than spread across four off-campus locations.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/faq.html</url><title>Frequently asked questions</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/questions.html</url><title>Submit a question</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley</url><title>Scotts Valley Center website</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/ucsc-scotts-valley-center.html</url><title> Press release: UC Santa Cruz signs lease to establish Scotts Valley Center</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="730a3fef8072701713dacb131e148066"><name>graduate-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Awards recognize top presentations at Graduate Research Symposium</title><summary>Graduate student researchers from across the divisions explained their work to a diverse audience during the symposium.</summary><keywords>Graduate Division</keywords><start-date>1462172400000</start-date><display-name>Awards recognize top presentations at Graduate Research Symposium</display-name><path>/2016/05/graduate-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/graduate-research</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1462218930864</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462222204344</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/grace-barcheck-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/grace-barcheck-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grace-barcheck-400.jpg</name><display-name>grace-barcheck-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>118178</file-size><width>400</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>Grace Barcheck</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/grace-barcheck-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/grace-barcheck-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grace-barcheck-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>grace-barcheck-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19493</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Grace Barcheck</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Grace Barcheck accepted the Chancellor's Award from Tyrus Miller, dean of the graduate division, at the Graduate Research Symposium.

<p>The campus began <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/scotts-valley-office-space.html">evaluating the site</a> at 100 Enterprise Way in early 2015 and entered into a 20-&#173;year lease on May 2, 2016. The UC Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley Center will house portions of the divisions of Business and Administrative Services, Information Technology Services, and University Relations in 127,000 square feet of office space in two three-&#173;floor modules. UC Santa Cruz will be the largest tenant at the complex, which was originally designed and built for the software &#173;maker Borland.</p>
<p>The campus-owned complex at 2300 Delaware Ave., where some BAS and ITS staff are currently located, will soon be used by faculty members and researchers, growing the campus&#8217;s academic presence on the west side of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>'Collaboration and sense of community'</strong></p>
<p>"The UC Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley Center will provide our staff members with a facility that supports collaboration and a sense of community," Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said. "Additionally, moving employees from 2300 Delaware to the new Scotts Valley Center will further our academic mission by providing much-needed space for research and inquiry."</p>
<p>With more than 3,300 non&#173;academic employees, UC Santa Cruz long ago outgrew the available space on campus and began leasing several buildings on the west side of Santa Cruz on Natural Bridges Drive, Delaware Avenue, and Shaffer Road. The Scotts Valley Center will free the university from managing multiple short-&#173;term leases and allow it to save money and staff time by entering into one long-term lease.</p>
<p>The Scotts Valley Center will unite employees in a central location, allowing for more collaboration and increased efficiency. Additionally, staff members will have access to an on&#173;site fitness center and cafeteria, and plans are underway to support easy travel between the main campus and Scotts Valley Center.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz established a committee of staff members from all three divisions working with the campus Real Estate Office to analyze feasibility and work through questions in topic areas such as IT infrastructure, transportation needs, the work environment, and many others.</p>
<p>The divisions will move to the new campus later this year, though no timeline has been set. A <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/faq.html">frequently-asked&#173;-questions page</a> provides more information about the office space and what employees can expect.</p>
<p><strong>Premiere research center</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will continue to have a presence at 2300 Delaware Ave., which it purchased in 2004. The long&#173;-term goal is to establish the complex as a premier research center capable of supporting the campus research programs growth goals and creating greater opportunities for collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>Renovations are planned for the 2300 Delaware complex to update infrastructure and building components to conform to current building codes, maintain building integrity, extend the life of building components, and sustain the building&#8217;s value.&#160; Further projects will build out research laboratories, academic and research offices, and collaboration spaces.&#160; Additional investments are under consideration to increase the building's sustainability, possibly by adding a rain&#173;water harvesting system, a thermal storage system, and an electrical micro&#173;-grid that uses renewable energy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley</url><title>UC Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley Center website</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/faq.html</url><title>Frequently asked questions</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/questions.html</url><title>Submit a question</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/scottsvalley/photos.html</url><title>Photos</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="732e649d8072701713dacb132e401234"><name>bike-to-work-week</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bike to Work Week activities</title><summary>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to host the 29th annual Santa Cruz County Spring Bike Week, May 6 -13, 2016.</summary><start-date>1462172400000</start-date><display-name>Bike to Work Week activities</display-name><path>/2016/05/bike-to-work-week</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/bike-to-work-week</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1462221299231</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462221838741</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to host the 29th annual Santa Cruz County Spring Bike Week, May 6 -13, 2016.

for <em><strong>Race, Class, and Culture through the Lens of Jazz</strong></em>--a special event presented by the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division, featuring a panel of jazz scholars, followed by an inspired performance by Bay Area jazz singer Kim Nalley.<br/>
<br/>
 The occasion was both a celebration of UNESCO&#8217;s International Jazz Day and UCSC&#8217;s annual alumni weekend.<br/>
<br/>
 The evening began with a conversation about the global historical role of jazz in race, class, and culture, featuring humanities dean Tyler Stovall, history professor Eric Porter and jazz singer/historian Kim Nalley.<br/>
<br/>
 They talked about the African American roots of jazz and moved on to the political nature of the art form.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Jazz is now essentially a century old,&#8221; Stovall noted. &#8220;People now call jazz America&#8217;s classical music. Different nations try to own jazz, but it&#8217;s distinctly an African American art form.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I think jazz has always been very much a political art form,&#8221; Stovall added. &#8220;It&#8217;s the politics of having African American culture showcased this kind of way. Having black players on stage was a political act. Or just the idea of performing before a mixed audience racially, which was something that you were not supposed to do.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Not following the notes as written is also political,&#8220; added Nalley, who in addition to her burgeoning singing career is now pursuing a Ph.D. at UC Berkeley (her dissertation is titled &#8220;GI Jazz&#8221;).<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;There&#8217;s always a lot of politics about just being on stage,&#8221; said Nalley. &#8220;It&#8217;s very hard for women to carve space in the jazz world. I recently gave birth to two beautiful girls, and I was very acutely aware that I&#8217;m from the first generation that&#8217;s allowed to perform onstage visibly pregnant and not have them cancel my gig or find a substitute.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 One audience member asked how to get jazz greater exposure beyond the elite. But Nalley questioned the assumption. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of great music in poorer neighborhoods where a lot of white people won&#8217;t go, so they just don&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; she responded.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;But she ultimately agreed with Porter, who pointed out that jazz needs to be taught in the schools. &#8220;Its one of those essential things that will continue to build this art form,&#8221; he noted.<br/>
<br/>
 After the panel, Nalley deftly switched roles from historian to jazz headliner.<br/>
<br/>
 She opened the show with a stunning version of &#8220;Summertime,&#8221; performing with no microphone and backed only by her acoustic pianist. From jazz ballads to gospel to rhythm and blues, Nalley had total command of the crowd, backed by piano, standup bass, guitar, and drums.</p>
<p>At one point after rocking the house, she sent her band away and sat down for a quiet song with her pianist, confiding: &#8220;I&#8217;m in very safe hands here in Kuumbwa&#8212;it&#8217;s like my living room.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The show ended with a rousing version of Prince's &#8220;Purple Rain.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;I think a lot of black women and black people in general like to honor and archive their ancestors and I continue to do that in my music,&#8221; Nalley observed.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I thought everybody could sing because my whole family sings. My great uncle played with Dexter Gordon. My aunt had some hits.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;But I&#8217;ll always remember what my great uncle said before I went off to tour Europe: &#8220;Never forget that this is our music. You are representing us.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78cdd9d28072701713dacb13c5ee40bb"><name>training-notice-error</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mistaken late notices regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment prevention training</title><summary>A technical issue has caused some UC Santa Cruz employees to receive late or non-compliance notices in error regarding completion of the required UC Sexual Harassment Prevention training.</summary><start-date>1462315500000</start-date><display-name>Training notice error</display-name><path>/2016/05/training-notice-error</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/training-notice-error</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1462315635863</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462315723540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A technical issue has caused some UC Santa Cruz employees to receive late or non-compliance notices in error regarding completion of the required UC Sexual Harassment Prevention training.<br/>

<p><em>The Guardian's</em> first virtual reality project aims to highlight the psychological and physiological devastation of solitary confinement.</p>
<p><span>Haney has spent four decades documenting the long-term psychological damage of incarceration in the United States. <span><em>The Guardian</em> worked closely with Haney, who explained the reactions that extreme isolation can cause. He provided them with a psychological narrative about what it would likely feel like when one enters a concrete cell six feet by nine feet, and the reaction to what he describes as &#8220;the varying dimensions of abject emptiness one encounters in the space.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;As a psychologist I can tell you that you are going to undergo many different kinds of reactions and some of them will be more immediate than others,&#8221; Haney says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odcsxUbVyZA">in the video trailer</a>. &#8220;There are high rates of suicide and self harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<span>Viewers can experience what being in solitary confinement is like thanks to the Guardian&#8217;s computer-generated reconstruction of a cell. When "inside," viewers can explore what they can and canot do in solitary confinement through the immersive exhibit.</span> <br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The project includes an interactive website with podcasts, video, prisoner stories, op-eds, as well as a mobile phone app.</span></p>
<span>&#8220;There are physical and physiological consequences of being deprived of human and social contact so that people&#8217;s brainwave patterns are altered and certainly people who are in these environments for many months or years on end have to change and transform who they are and so they are damaged,&#8221; Haney says in the piece.</span> <br/>

The finding has important implications for assessing tsunami hazards. The discovery was made by conducting the first-ever detailed investigation of centimeter-level seafloor movement at an offshore subduction zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve previously used land-based instruments to detect slow-slip events, but this is the first time we&#8217;ve been able to document slow slip in the shallow portion of an offshore subduction zone. With instruments on the seafloor right above the plate boundary, we now have very high-resolution mapping of where the slip occurred,&#8221; said coauthor Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>First author Laura Wallace, a research scientist at The University of Texas at Austin&#8217;s Institute for Geophysics, led an international team of researchers from the United States, Japan, and New Zealand in the collaborative research project. &#8220;These data have revealed the true extent of slow-motion earthquakes at an offshore subduction zone for the first time,&#8221; said Wallace, who earned her Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz in 2002.</p>
<p><strong>Subduction zone</strong></p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most devastating tsunamis are generated by earthquakes that occur near the trenches of subduction zones, places where one tectonic plate begins to dive or &#8220;subduct&#8221; beneath another. Using a network of highly-sensitive seafloor pressure recorders, the team detected a slow-slip event in September 2014 off the east coast of New Zealand. The study was undertaken at the Hikurangi subduction zone, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath New Zealand&#8217;s North Island.</p>
<p>The slow-slip event lasted two weeks, resulting in 15 to 20 centimeters of movement along the fault that lies between New Zealand and the Pacific Plate, a distance equivalent to three to four years of background plate motion. If the movement had occurred suddenly, rather than slowly, it would have resulted in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake. The seafloor sensors recorded up to 5.5 centimeters (about 2 inches) of upward movement of the seafloor during the event.</p>
<p>Slow-slip events are similar to earthquakes, but instead of releasing strain between two tectonic plates in seconds, they do it over days to weeks, creating quiet, centimeter-sized shifts in the landscape. In a few cases, these small shifts have been associated with setting off destructive earthquakes. The slow-slip event that the team studied occurred in the same location as a magnitude 7.2 earthquake in 1947 that generated a large tsunami. The study shows that the two types of seismic events can occur on the same part of a plate boundary.</p>
<p><strong>HOBITSS</strong></p>
<p>The link has been difficult to document in the past because most slow-slip monitoring networks are land-based and are located far from the trenches that host tsunami-generating earthquakes, Wallace said. The data for this study was recorded by HOBITSS, a temporary underwater network that monitored slow-slip events by recording vertical movement of the seafloor. HOBITSS stands for &#8220;Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results clearly show that shallow, slow-slip event source areas are also capable of hosting seismic rupture and generating tsunamis,&#8221; said coauthor Yoshihiro Ito, a professor at Kyoto University. &#8220;This increases the need to continuously monitor shallow, offshore slow-slip events at subduction zones, using permanent monitoring networks similar to those that have been established offshore of Japan.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Schwartz, the demonstration that pressure sensors on the seafloor can be used to accurately measure the deformation associated with slow-slip events is an important proof of concept. "The ultimate goal is to map the mechanical properties of the shallow plate interface and understand what areas have the potential to slip in ways that produce damaging earthquakes, tsunami-generating earthquakes, or slow slip," she said.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are unpredictable events, Wallace said, but the linkage between slow-slip events and earthquakes could eventually help in forecasting the likelihood of damaging earthquakes. &#8220;To do that we will have to understand the links between slow-slip events and earthquakes much better than we currently do,&#8221; Wallace said.</p>

(Photo by Taylor Noble)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new study documenting the negative effects of California's drought on an endangered lizard in the San Joaquin Desert provides a glimpse into the potential effects of future droughts expected in California as a result of climate change. The findings, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154838">published May 2 in the online journal <em>PLoS One</em></a><em>,</em> may also provide guidance on how to buffer these negative effects to avoid species extinctions.</p>
<p>Coauthor Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard could face major losses of suitable habitat due to climate change. In the new study, Sinervo, UCSC graduate student Joseph Stewart, and collaborators at the Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and The Nature Conservancy looked at the effects on this species of the 2012-2014 drought, the most severe multi-year drought in southwestern North America in the past 1,200 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our observations of range-wide collapse of recruitment during the drought, the future picture for the blunt-nosed leopard lizard is not all that rosy,&#8221; Sinervo said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Potential extinction</strong></p>
<p>The fieldwork for the study took place in the fall of 2014. Preliminary surveys of blunt-nosed leopard lizards in the San Joaquin Desert revealed that some populations failed to reproduce during the drought, causing concern about potential extinction effects on this critically endangered species. To determine whether this phenomenon was widespread or isolated to particularly vulnerable populations, the researchers rapidly deployed personnel to conduct surveys of all known blunt-nosed leopard lizard populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the drought hit, we were positioned to team up with our partners and take advantage of this unique opportunity to assess the potential effects of climate change on a vulnerable species,&#8221; said Mike Westphal, BLM ecologist and lead author of the study. &#8220;Thanks to the geographic nature of the study, we were also able to identify key climate refugia for the species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous studies had documented links between drought and reproduction in populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizards. Because the drought produced geographic variation in the amount of rainfall across all of the populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizards, the new study was able to demonstrate this relationship range-wide, allowing researchers to exploit the drought to predict how future climate change might affect the extinction potential of the blunt-nosed leopard lizard and other desert-adapted endangered species.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study has serious implications not just for animals in California, but potentially for species all over the world affected by climate change. Our work suggests that the drought of 2012-2014 has had serious effects on the long-term survival of the blunt-nosed lizard, and significant intervention may be needed to preserve the future of these animals,&#8221; said coauthor Scott Butterfield of the Nature Conservancy. &#8220;As we consider the fallout from rising temperatures in California, it&#8217;s important to think of what would best help species like the blunt-nosed leopard lizard survive &#8212; which includes preserving valuable desert habitat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study provides an excellent example of how collaborative research among land management agencies, wildlife agencies, non-governmental organizations, and universities can produce important insights into the potential effects of climate change. The results of the study are anticipated to guide ongoing conservation efforts in the San Joaquin Desert region of California. More importantly, the success of the study should provide encouragement to other researchers to take full advantage of extreme weather events such as historic droughts to learn about the future potential effects of climate change.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7df72d588072701713dacb13fdd8d581"><name>aviram-social-justice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hastings Law professor to speak on prisons and transformation of punishment</title><summary>Professor Hadar Aviram of UC Hastings College of the Law will speak on the American prison system and the transformation of punishment as part of the continuing UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings Social Justice Lecture Series Monday, May 9.</summary><start-date>1462407000000</start-date><display-name>Hadar Aviram Social Justice Series</display-name><path>/2016/05/aviram-social-justice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/aviram-social-justice</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1462402230272</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462820465536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/aviram-hadar-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/aviram-hadar-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aviram-hadar-325.jpg</name><display-name>aviram-hadar-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>119360</file-size><width>325</width><height>486</height></image><image-alt>hadar aviram</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/aviram-hadar-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/aviram-hadar-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aviram-hadar-80.jpg</name><display-name>aviram-hadar-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>12888</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>hadar aviram</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Hadar Aviram is a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law whose research focuses on the criminal justice system.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Talk is the latest in the UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings Social Justice Lecture Series</article-subhead><article-text><p>Professor Hadar Aviram of UC Hastings College of the Law will speak on the American prison system and the transformation of punishment as part of the continuing UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings Social Justice Lecture Series.</p>
<p>The event will begin at 7 p.m. Monday, May 9, at University Center, Colleges Nine and Ten, on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Cost is $5 and includes parking. The public is invited.</p>
<p>Aviram&#8217;s lecture is titled &#8220;Cheap on Crime: The Transformation of American Punishment&#8221; based on her 2015 book <em>Cheap on Crime: Recession-Era Politics and the Transformation of Punishment</em> (UC Press) which examines the impact of the financial crisis on the American penal landscape.</p>
<p>Craig Haney, University Professor of psychology and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, will introduce Aviram. Haney is a renowned expert on the U.S. penal system who has testified widely on the psychological effects of incarceration before state and federal lawmakers.</p>
<p>Changes are brewing in the American correctional system after 40 years of increasing prison construction and incarceration rates. Calls from the right and left are being made to reform punishment through fiscal prudence and austerity.<br/>
<br/>
 In <em><a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520277311">Cheap on Crime</a></em>, Aviram draws on archival and journalistic research and builds on social history and economics literature to show the impact the recession had on policy discussions of the death penalty, the war on drugs, incarceration practices, prison health care, and other aspects of the American correctional landscape.</p>
<p>Before joining the Hastings faculty in 2007, Aviram practiced as a military defense attorney in the Israel Defense Forces for five years. She completed her M.A. in Criminology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and her Ph.D. in UC Berkeley's Jurisprudence and Social Policy program, where she studied as a Fulbright Fellow and a Regents Intern, and taught at Tel Aviv University.</p>
<p>Professor Aviram&#8217;s research focuses on the criminal justice system and examines policing, courtroom practices, and broad policy decisions through social science perspectives. She co-chairs the Hastings Institute for Criminal Justice and runs the California Correctional Crisis blog.</p>
<p>The Social Justice Speaker Series is part of the collaboration between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings and supports the 3+3 BA-JD program that allows students to obtain a bachelors degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven.</p>
<p>Supporting partners include the Santa Cruz County Bar Association, Santa Cruz County Trial Lawyers Association, UC Santa Cruz Social Sciences Division, UC Santa Cruz departments of politics, legal studies, economics, feminist studies and sociology</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Sciences</a></em></strong> will continue its series of LASER talks on campus this spring on Wednesday, May 11, at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center.</p>
<p>The event will include presentations by two UC Santa Cruz professors--astrophysicist <strong>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</strong> (<em>Turning Stars into Gold</em>) and film archivist <strong>Rick Prelinger</strong> (<em>Inconvenient Materialities</em>), plus UCSC doctoral candidate and artist <strong>Elaine Gan</strong> (<em>Making Time Appear</em>), and marine biologist <strong>Nicole Crane</strong> from Cabrillo College (<em>One People One Reef: Combining Culture, Context and Science</em>).</p>
<p>To high-energy astrophysicists, the calm beauty of the night sky is the world&#8217;s grandest illusion. It contains some of the wildest, most elusive odd creatures in the Universe. The phenomena are unique in their extreme physical conditions, not faced by astronomers before, and understanding them requires both imagination and physical intuition. As a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, <strong>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</strong> is developing the conceptual framework needed to understand the violent and&#160;erratic nature of the Universe.</p>
<p>Elements such as carbon, oxygen, iron, and gold are forged either in the nuclear furnaces of stars or in the blaze of energy when stars explode as supernovae. Supernova explosions spew the newly forged elements into space, where they drift in great clouds of gas and dust that eventually collapse to form new stars and planets.</p>
<p>Although the general picture of element formation is well understood, many questions remain about the processes that form precious elements such as platinum and gold. The astrophysical details, in particular, are not fully understood. Ramirez-Ruiz will outline some of the main issues in his talk.</p>
<p>"You and the world around you are a temporary arrangement of matter that took many billions of years to assemble," said Ramirez-Ruiz. "Imagine if you could deconstruct it all and trace each element&#8217;s journey. What did they experience as they traveled through space? Many trillions of atoms in your body were forged in the incandescent cores of stars and violent stellar explosions. Such element generation has occurred since the birth of the first stars in the Galaxy, and without it life on Earth would not be possible."</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Gan</strong>&#160;is a doctoral candidate in the Film &amp; Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz and also serves as art director of Aarhus University Research on the Anthropocene (AURA) in Denmark. She has been a fellow of the New York Foundation for the Arts&#160;and a graduate fellow of the Science and Justice Center at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;My talk will consider an unintended race that emerges when&#160;<em>miracle rice</em>, nitrogen, and brown planthoppers meet in Southeast Asian rice fields in the 1960s,&#8221; said Gan. &#8220;It offers an arts/science approach to articulating ecological crises and accelerating contamination."</p>
<p>Gan&#8217;s recent interdisciplinary projects include co-curating an exhibition titled&#160;<em>DUMP! Multispecies Making and Unmaking&#160;</em>at Kunsthal Aarhus, Denmark (2015); running a seminar series on multispecies technologies in the Anthropocene at Haus der Kulturen der Welt/HKW Berlin (2016); and co-editing an anthology,&#160;<em>Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet: Stories from the Anthropocene</em> (forthcoming 2016).&#160;</p>
<p>An associate professor of film and digital media&#160;at UC Santa Cruz, <strong>Rick Prelinger</strong> is an archivist, writer, and filmmaker. His collection of 60,000 "ephemeral" films (advertising, educational, industrial, and amateur) was acquired by the Library of Congress in 2002. He has partnered with Internet Archive to make a subset of the <strong><em><a href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger&amp;tab=about">Prelinger &#160;Collection</a></em></strong> (now 6,500 films) available online for free viewing, downloading and reuse.</p>
<p>Prelinger&#8217;s <em>Lost Landscapes</em>&#160;participatory urban history projects have been featured in San Francisco, Detroit, Oakland, and Los Angeles. He is a board member of Internet Archive and frequently writes and speaks on the future of archives and issues relating to archival access and regeneration.</p>
<p>In 2004, he co-founded the <strong><em><a href="http://www.prelingerlibrary.org/home/about/">Prelinger&#160;Library</a></em></strong> with Megan Shaw Prelinger--an independent research library located in San Francisco&#8217;s South-of-Market neighborhood. The library is primarily a collection of 19th and 20th century historical ephemera, periodicals, maps, and books, most published in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole Crane</strong> is a professor of biology at&#160;Cabrillo College and a senior conservation scientist at the&#160;<a href="http://www.oceanicsociety.org/">Oceanic Society</a>. Her&#160;research focuses on long term monitoring, with an emphasis in the ecology of coral and temperate reefs. Crane&#8217;s work is aimed at conservation and the protection of marine resources, and helping others to achieve that.</p>
<p>Crane's field work includes temperate and tropical reef monitoring, fish biology, stream ecology, plant communities, and marine&#160;mammal ecology. She has been working with communities helping to set up monitoring programs, looking at habitat and fish populations on reefs, and leading natural history&#160;expeditions for more than two decades with the Oceanic Society.</p>
<p>Admission to the May 11 LASER talk is free. The presentations begin at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center building (DARC--Room 108). Doors open at 6:30 with refreshments provided.</p>

<p>I'm delighted to announce today the purchase of a building that will house the UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus. Located in Santa Clara, this 90,000-square-foot building will provide a fitting home for valley-oriented research initiatives, our burgeoning professional master's programs, and <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Extension</a>.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz has a lot to offer Silicon Valley, and vice versa. This multidisciplinary center will facilitate collaborations with industry, nonprofits, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations, artists, social activists, and other educational institutions. It will expand our reach, increase our visibility, and spread the ethos of UC Santa Cruz beyond the redwoods.<br/>
<br/>
 Faced with losing the leased space that housed our existing valley-based master's programs, as well as UCSC Extension, it made financial sense to invest for the long-term by buying a building. The purchase is being financed by a 99-year, interest-only loan that UC makes available to help campuses with strategic investments such as this.<br/>
<br/>
 Having this foothold in the valley will open doors for all of our faculty and students, both undergraduates and graduate; it will support both the research and instructional aspects of our mission. The campus is currently reviewing faculty-proposed masters degree programs in six areas: aeronautics, natural language processing, data science, global technology for social innovation, human-computer interaction, and serious games. My hope is that we will launch the first new program by Fall 2018.<br/>
<br/>
 Importantly, the UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus will be a resource for the entire UC Santa Cruz community&#8212;not just those based in Santa Clara, and definitely not only those engaged in science, technology, and engineering. Like our coastal marine campus on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, this location is a good fit for us. It builds on our strengths and will broaden our impact. I hope you'll stop by 3175 Bowers Ave. in Santa Clara and see for yourself that Banana Slugs can thrive in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8244466f8072701713dacb137f68b671"><name>borders-belonging</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Events explore traumatic journeys migrants endure on the way to the border</title><summary>The series of UC Santa Cruz events on human migration continues Friday and Saturday, May 6–7 with “Rethinking Migration,” the first in the Andrew W.

Mellon Foundation Sawyer Seminar on non-citizenship and part of the Chicano Latino Research Center's Borders and Belonging series.</p>
<p>The conference begins at 8:30 a.m. both days at the Merrill Cultural Center and will feature &#160;visiting scholars and UCSC professors in the humanities and social sciences who will focus on issues surrounding migration. The sessions are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Kicking off the Borders and Belonging series April 29 was a screening of <em>Mar&#237;a en Tierra De Nadie</em> (Maria in Nobody&#8217;s Land), the award-winning documentary chronicling migrants crossing central America. The event also honored the 15th anniversary of the Department of Latin American and Latino studies.</p>
<p>More than 500 students, alumni, staff, faculty, and community members packed the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz for the film that documents the harrowing journey migrants make before they even get to the U.S.-Mexico border. A Q&amp;A with filmmaker Marcela Zamora followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a powerful experience watching it together,&#8221; said Pat Zavella, professor and LALS department chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a hard movie to watch,&#8221; said Chicano Latino Research Center director Catherine Ram&#237;rez, &#8220;but it tells a story that must be shared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zamora, along with her partner and journalist &#211;scar Mart&#237;nez, spent months accompanying migrants to learn about the problems they encounter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women arrive to America raped, traumatized, and destroyed,&#8221; Zamora said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a process to tell their story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film includes an interview in a brothel with a woman who was tricked into taking a job as a waitress but then forced to pay her way a prostitute. In another scene, Zamora meets another woman who was sold by her own uncle as payment for his freedom after the pair was kidnapped by a local gang. Zamora includes another story of a woman who loses a foot after being pushed off a train by a drunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Documentary is a tool to illuminate those dark corners in order to make people uncomfortable,&#8221; Zamora said.</p>
<p>The conversation continued the next day with Mart&#237;nez, author of <em>The Beast: Riding the Rails and Dodging Narcos on the Migrant Trail</em> (2013) based on Zamora and his experiences. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people arrive here with a lot of damage,&#8221; Mart&#237;nez emphasized, adding that many migrants do not share their stories so they are not reported by mainstream media. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Journalism puts a light on dark corners of our society.&#8221; said Mart&#237;nez. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These people are your gardeners, cooks, and neighbors, and you don&#8217;t know them,&#8221; said undergraduate and first-generation student Adriana Garcia (College Eight, &#8217;17, Latin American and Latino studies and politics).</p>
<p>&#8220;We owe a lot of respect to them. Their knowledge is just as important if not more,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://clrc.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/news-article-rethinking-migration.html</url><title>More information on 'Rethinking Migration'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/watts/pages/main.html</url><title>Lewis Watts Photography</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8355de0f8072701713dacb13badf9112"><name>drummond-pike</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Original crowd funder honored with Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award</title><summary>Before crowdfunding, there was Drummond Pike.

<p>The 1970 politics graduate of Stevenson College was awarded the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award for his accomplishments in combining philanthropy with political activism.</p>
<p>Alumni, faculty, and university administration gathered at the newly renovated historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn on April 29 to recognize his achievements.</p>
<p>Pike founded the Tides Foundation in 1976 as a way to connect philanthropists with grassroots causes and public-interest groups. Pike was one of the first social entrepreneurs to pioneer the use of donor-advised funds. Instead of donating directly to a charity or starting a foundation, individuals can turn to a donor-advised fund to make charitable donations on their behalf.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Tides emerged as a key provider for the progressive community. Its low-cost, online donation services, Groundspring (now Network for Good), made it one of the nation&#8217;s largest sponsorship organizations. Tides has been a catalyst for hundreds of nonprofit organizations and projects launching. &#160;</p>
<p>Pike also co-founded Working Assets (now called Credo) in 1985 and has helped business leaders including George Soros with their philanthropy. Soros has helped fund organizations like MoveOn.org and Human Rights Watch through Credo.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Pike shared three lessons he learned at UC Santa Cruz: play by the rules, be transparent, and if it does not exist, go start it. &#160;Ask questions, invent, and innovate, he said.</p>
<p>As a member of one of the earliest classes, Pike helped to shape the spirit that is UC Santa Cruz today.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no vehicle for student voices so we got to invent it,&#8221; he said about the intercollegiate board he established as a way to encourage more co-ed socializing in the dorms. He also helped found the first underground newspaper as a way to highlight issues impacting students.</p>
<p>&#8220;His progressive values mirror our own,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drummond deserves a Ph.D. in progressive social change,&#8221; commented Working Assets co-founder Michael Kieschnick in an email response to UCSC&#8217;s announcement of Pike&#8217;s award.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pike is a model not just for students of the past but for students of today,&#8221; said Alice Yang, the provost for Stevenson College.</p>
<p>Also offering remarks was professor emeritus of sociology Craig Reinarman who pointed out how the Tides foundation made it possible for donors to achieve more through its multiplier effect.</p>
<p>The Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award is given annually to a social sciences graduate whose career is characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service. Past recipients include Pulitzer Prize winner Dana Priest (&#8217;81, politics, Merrill) and NPR science correspondent Joe Palca (&#8217;82, psychology Ph.D.).</p>
<p>The recipient is chosen by members of the Social Sciences Board of Councilors, an advisory board for the division.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="83c906c38072701713dacb131ec2da6e"><name>night-at-museum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Night at the Museum to spotlight African American art and history</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research will present 'UCSC Night at the Museum: The Kinsey African American Art &amp;

History Collection</em>, a free public event at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, on Wednesday, May 18, beginning at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The event offers the community a chance to explore one of the largest collections of African American art and artifacts in the country, spanning 400 years of history.</p>
<p>With education as a goal, The Kinsey Collection has been on a national tour since 2007, including stops at such venues as the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, The Norton Museum of Art, and The California African American Museum.</p>
<p>Reflecting a rich cultural heritage&#8212;and the often untold story of African American achievement and contribution&#8212;the Kinsey Collection includes work by Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Jacob Lawrence, and Richard Mayhew, alongside archival material related to Frederick Douglass, Zora Neale Hurston, and Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>The evening will include a public conversation</strong> with special guest Ethan Michaeli, author of <em>The Defender: How the Legendary Black Newspaper Changed America</em>.</p>
<p>Just published in January, the book was praised by the <em>New York Times</em> as &#8220;an extraordinary history...deeply researched, elegantly written&#8230;and a towering achievement that will not be soon forgotten," while the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> noted &#8220;<em>The Defender</em> is essentially a record of the African-American struggle in our times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michaeli will be interviewed by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history, David Anthony, starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Defender</em> is a detailed, accessible, lively narrative that reconstructs the history of an iconic voice in the long saga of African-American journalism, demonstrating its world historical impact,&#8221; said Anthony.</p>
<p>&#8220;This multidimensional approach to the newspaper as local, national, and global is an important feature of Michaeli's text. It is simultaneously the story of a family enterprise, a Chicago institution, and a participant in the practice of social change in the broader struggle to realize democracy in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony added that he was intrigued by the manner in which the author captured the story of <em>The Defender</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are both insider and outsider dimensions in this work,&#8221; Anthony noted. &#8220;Michaeli was himself part of the staff of the newspaper as a copy editor and investigative reporter who forged close connections with senior colleagues who were &#8216;keepers of the flame.&#8217; Yet he is not African American, not unusual for <em>The Defender</em> or African American newspapers in general, but a subject worth exploring. I too devoted a considerable amount of time to researching African-American journalism and retain vivid recollections of its impact upon my own formation as a person of African descent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony said that his conversation with the author will be followed by a public reception and book signing. He noted that the audience will have time to examine the Kinsey Collection both before and after the interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kinsey Collection represents a rare glimpse into a long standing, albeit not always widely appreciated practice of painstaking&#160;preservation and presentation&#160;of key archival materials,&#8221; Anthony added, &#8220;carefully collected and&#160;curated by persons of African descent and others documenting&#160;the lived experiences of millions of people whose stories are far less well known than they should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The study, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12613/full">published May 6 in <em>Ecology Letters</em></a>, looked at how juvenile mussels respond to varying environmental conditions at seven sites spread across 800 miles of coastline in California and Oregon. The results showed that the ability of mussels to cope with more acidic conditions depends largely on how much food is available to them, and both factors vary from place to place in a complex geographic mosaic of environmental and ecological conditions.</p>
<p>"Ocean acidification is likely to progress along our coastline as a patchwork of hotspots rather than a large blanket, and the background conditions in these hotspots can determine how species are affected," said first author Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Lower pH</strong></p>
<p>As the oceans absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, ocean acidification is expected to make life harder for many marine organisms, especially shellfish and other animals with shells or skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Acidification refers to a lowering of the pH of seawater when it absorbs carbon dioxide, pushing it closer to the acidic end of the scale, although it is still slightly alkaline. A small decrease in pH affects the chemical equilibrium of seawater, making it harder for organisms to build calcium carbonate structures.</p>
<p>For mussels, that can mean thinner shells, making them more vulnerable to predators like the dogwhelk, a marine snail that attacks mussels by drilling through their shells. The lower the pH, the more energy it takes to build a shell, so the food supply is crucial in determining how well mussels can cope with ocean acidification.</p>
<p>Kroeker's team took advantage of geographic variability in the wind-driven upwelling of cold, deep ocean water along the West Coast. That deep water is not only rich in nutrients, it also has relatively high concentrations of carbon dioxide, both because it is cold (cold water can absorb and hold more carbon dioxide than warm water) and because the decomposition of organic matter that sinks into the depths releases carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification is further increasing the acidity of that deep water.</p>
<p>"We can use the spatial differences in upwelling to study how species respond to seawater that's high in carbon dioxide," Kroeker said. "The upwelling of relatively acidic deep water is a natural process, but these waters will become even more acidic in the future."</p>
<p><strong>Dogwhelks</strong></p>
<p>The researchers looked at the effects of low-pH seawater, food availability, and temperatures on the growth and morphology of juvenile mussels at each site. They also tested the susceptibility of mussels from each site to drilling by dogwhelks.</p>
<p>The results showed that mussels actually grew fastest at sites with frequent low pH conditions as well as an abundant food supply. These sites tended to experience intermittent upwelling that supplies nutrients to surface waters, spurring blooms of algae and providing plenty of food for the filter-feeding mussels. They grew slowest and were most vulnerable to predators in locations exposed to low pH conditions and an inconsistent food supply. High body temperatures during low tides, another stressor for mussels, also made them more vulnerable to predation.</p>
<p>With continued ocean acidification and climate change, many locations will experience environmental conditions well beyond the range of conditions seen in this study. In trying to predict the impacts of environmental changes, it is crucial to look at multiple environmental drivers and how their co-occurrence and interactions are likely to shift geographically, Kroeker said.</p>
<p>"Most of our tools for managing coastal species and ecosystems--such as marine protected areas and regulating point source pollution--are spatially explicit, and this research illustrates there may be hotspots of vulnerability or resilience that we could protect or manage locally," she said.</p>

<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus, a 90,000-square-foot academic building at 3175 Bowers Ave., will support UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s ambitious growth plans for the region&#8211;developing a stronger connection and greater interaction between faculty, students, and Silicon Valley industry; establishing professional master&#8217;s programs aimed at meeting the needs of the region; housing Silicon Valley-facing research programs and educational and research partnerships with other UCs and regional universities; and hosting events that share campus expertise with the Silicon Valley technology community.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This building represents a significant step in growing UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s presence in this global hub of innovation,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;It will be a home for our existing ventures and give us room to offer courses and degrees that will help Silicon Valley address some of its greatest challenges.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Under the direction of Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt, the UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus is responsible for developing and coordinating near- and long-term strategies for sustaining and enhancing the UC presence in Silicon Valley.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to providing professional education and workforce development, UC Santa Cruz is looking to further expand and enhance its industry engagement and research alliances.<br/>
<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus currently offers a master&#8217;s degree program in Games and Playable Media and is planning to offer additional advanced professional degrees based on faculty proposals submitted from across all academic divisions. Those proposals are currently under review.<br/>
<br/>
 The Silicon Valley Campus is also home to UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, the professional training arm of UC Santa Cruz. For more than 40 years, UCSC Extension has offered UC-approved courses that reflect the latest tools and technologies, and since 1987, Extension has offered courses in Silicon Valley. UCSC Extension provides professional training that reflects the academic rigor of the University of California and the hands-on, roll-up-your-sleeves practicality of Silicon Valley culture. Developed with guidance from key industry leaders and academic experts, Extension&#8217;s certificate programs in more than 40 disciplines match the economic demand of multiple industries, from engineering to business, education to bio-science, and environmental safety.<br/>
<br/>
 During the 2014-2015 year, UCSC Extension enrolled 18,000 students; 11,000 adult learners and 6,000 middle school and high school students through Scout from the University of California, an online program designed to meet the needs of first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.<br/>
<br/>
 UCSC Extension&#8217;s growing programs for international students have attracted professionals from more than 30 countries, many of whom have taken advantage of internship and Optional Practical Training (OPT) programs, the first step in finding work in the United States. The move also marks the opening of a new English language training center, which will offer English language instruction for non-native speakers and language learners. Extension also partners with retraining and job development programs in the Bay Area, which draw students eligible for federal and statewide workforce training.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz has relocated its programs from 2505 Augustine Drive in Santa Clara. Campus leaders said the relocation to a larger building in a prominent location is a commitment to Silicon Valley, and that the additional programs, new connections, and other activities will bring additional revenue and provide great value to the campus, its faculty and students, and to Silicon Valley&#8217;s residents and industry.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz began full operations in the new facility on April 18. The Bowers Avenue building, built in 1978, was certified LEED gold after a 2013 renovation.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;UC Santa Cruz will have a strong presence in Silicon Valley for years to come,&#8221; Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said. &#8220;It makes sound strategic and fiscal sense to acquire this building to serve as a central place to house our new efforts.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9b81c3258072701713dacb1357ee556b"><name>voter-registration-reminder</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Voter registration and primary Election Day reminder</title><summary>Monday, May 23 is the deadline to register to vote in the June 7 primary election. </summary><start-date>1462896000000</start-date><display-name>Voter registration and primary Election Day reminder</display-name><path>/2016/05/voter-registration-reminder</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/voter-registration-reminder</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1462897851805</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1462897902245</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Monday, May 23 is the deadline to register to vote in the June 7 primary election.&#160;</p>

This year&#8217;s festival also features live music, free food, and guest speakers that include community members involved in saving Santa Cruz&#8217;s Beach Flats Garden, along with a presentation on the history of the Bracero Program.</p>
<p>This free event takes place Thursday, May 19 from 4&#8211;6:30 p.m. at the Hay Barn at UC Santa Cruz, near the campus&#8217;s main entrance. &#160;Available will be fresh organic strawberries and agua fresca made from berries grown at the UCSC Farm and local farms from Watsonville to Salinas, along with campus and community organizations&#8217; interactive tabling activities, and tours of the adjacent UCSC Farm.</p>
<p>Featured will be a special performance by Diana Gameros, winner of the Emerging Leader Award from the Chicana/Latina Foundation for her work in music and social justice activism. Gameros creates authentic, inspiring music that reflects the 21st century experiences of a young indie artist at the borderlands between cultures, languages, and genres.</p>
<p>In addition, a dynamic panel of leaders will discuss local, community injustices as well as worker oppression in strawberry production. Panelists include Ann Lopez, Michelle Glowa, and two Beach Flats Garden jardineros, Emilio and Federico.</p>
<p>Lopez, author of <em>The Farmworkers&#8217; Journey</em>, has worked with farmworkers in Central California for the past 18 years. Michelle Glowa is a UCSC environmental studies and sociology professor studying food justice and urban agricultural movements in California. Santa Cruz&#8217;s Beach Flats Garden is a long-established community garden boasting agricultural and cultural diversity that is now being threatened by commercial development.</p>
<p>A second discussion panel features a Cal Ag Roots Story Listening Session on the Bracero Program, a guest worker program that ran from 1942&#8211;1964. Ildi Carlisle-Cummins, Cal Ag Roots Project Director at the California Institute for Rural Studies, and Ignacio Ornelas, Ph.D. candidate in history at UCSC and archivist at Stanford University, will tell the story of a key moment in farm labor history: the organizing that ended the Bracero Program and launched the United Farm Workers Union.</p>
<p>Daniel Ruanova, a Tijuana-based artist who works in multiple media and has partnered with Ornelas to produce powerful pieces that tell the Bracero story visually as part of the Bracero Legacy Project, will join the second panel session. This story is part of a series of Cal Ag Roots stories that unearth hidden histories of California farming in order to place current California food movement work in a historic context.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival takes place at the new Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) Hay Barn near the intersection of Coolidge Drive and Ranch View Road. Parking is available in the lot at the corner of Coolidge Drive and Carriage House Road. Permits will be available for $4, and parking is free after 5 p.m.</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by the UCSC Food Systems Working Group, with support from Measure 43 and the CASFS. &#160;More information is available at &#160;<a href="mailto:ucscfswg@gmail.com">ucscfswg@gmail.com</a> and 831-459-3675.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a1b459ac8072701713dacb137e929959"><name>chavez-convocation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Carmen Perez returns to campus as Chavez Convocation keynote speaker</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumna Carmen Perez returns to campus as keynote speaker for the 13th annual Cesar Chavez Convocation scheduled for Wednesday, May 18, 7–9 p.m. at the College Nine/Ten multipurpose room.&#13;

Doors open at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The convocation is free and open to the public and honors the memory of Cesar Chavez, his achievements, commitment to social justice/civil rights, unrelenting efforts to cultivate grassroots leadership, and successful formation of the United Farm Workers Union (UFW).</p>
<p>Perez is executive director of New York-based The Gathering for Justice, founded in 2005 by Harry Belafonte to build a movement to end child incarceration and work toward the elimination of racial inequities in the criminal justice system that lead to mass incarceration.</p>
<p>After the death of her 19-year-old sister when she was 17, Perez began dedicating her life to creating programs and initiatives that would help transform the lives of young people. She&#8217;s been an activist ever since.</p>
<p>After studying at UC Santa Cruz, she worked for Barrios Unidos in Santa Cruz, dedicated to providing non-violence training and re-entry services for the incarcerated. In 2005, she met Belafonte, &#160;as he was forming The Gathering for Justice and organizing marginalized communities in non-violent actions across the country.</p>
<p>Belafonte invited Perez to join. She served both organizations while continuing to build her own programs focused on young girls and youth justice. In 2006, Perez became a bilingual probation officer with the Santa Cruz County Probation Department. With an all-female intensive caseload, she worked to provide appropriate programs and re-entry services for young women in the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>In 2008, she became national organizer of The Gathering for Justice and two years later was named executive director. In November 2013, she founded Justice League NYC, a task force of juvenile and criminal justice advocates, experts, artists, and formerly incarcerated individuals brought together to build &#8220;Growing Up Locked Down&#8221; (GULD) a three-day juvenile justice conference. &#160;</p>
<p>Perez is recognized as an expert in juvenile and criminal justice, and system accountability, and has been featured widely in the media. She recently testified as a criminal and juvenile justice reform expert before the President&#8217;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</p>
<p>She was selected as Chavez Convocation keynote speaker for her efforts in pursuing justice during a time of escalating injustice. Previous convocation speakers have been Barrios Unidos co-founder Daniel &#8220;Nane&#8221; Alejandrez (2015); Cesar Cruz, co-founder and assistant dean at the Harvard University Secondary School Program, (2014); UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta (2013/2004); Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas (2012); Father Gregory Boyle, executive director of Homeboy Industries (2011); Mar&#237;a Hinojosa, journalist, managing editor of Latino USA (2010); Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labor Center (2009); performance artist Guillermo G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a (2008); Maria Elena Durazo, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, (2007); United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez (2006); and Luis Valdez, playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker and director, (2005).</p>
<p>The Cesar Chavez Convocation is presented by the College Ten Co-Curricular Programs Office and The Chicano Resource Center (El Centro), and the Dean of Students Office.&#160;It &#160;is co-sponsored by Community and Resource Empowerment (e2); American Indian Resource Center; African American Resource and Cultural Center; Asian American Resource Center; Lionel Cantu Queer Resource Center; Women's Resource Center; College Eight Senate; Porter College Senate; Oakes College Senate; Crown College Senate; Stevenson College Senate; College Nine Senate; College Ten Senate; and Cowell College Senate.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a1bbc22d8072701713dacb138126c478"><name>shark-jelly</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proton-conducting material found in electrosensory organs of sharks</title><summary>Scientists measured surprisingly high proton conductivity in a jelly that fills unique organs in sharks, skates, and rays.</summary><keywords>Marco Rolandi, ampullae of Lorenzini, shark jelly, proton conductor</keywords><start-date>1463162400000</start-date><display-name>Proton-conducting material found in electrosensory organs of sharks</display-name><path>/2016/05/shark-jelly</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/shark-jelly</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1463002315865</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463162742536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/aol-jelly-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/aol-jelly-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aol-jelly-400.jpg</name><display-name>aol-jelly-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>36651</file-size><width>400</width><height>286</height></image><image-alt>beads of clear jelly on skin of skate</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/drawings-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/drawings-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>drawings-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>drawings-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13167</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>drawing of shark head</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Pressing along the canals on the ventral side of an adult skate causes a clear, viscous jelly to extrude from the pores of the ampullae of Lorenzini.

(Images by Luk Cox)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Scientists measured surprisingly high proton conductivity in a jelly that fills unique electrosensing organs found in sharks, skates, and rays</article-subhead><article-text><p>Sharks, skates, and rays can detect very weak electric fields produced by prey and other animals using an array of unusual organs known as the ampullae of Lorenzini. Exactly how these electrosensory organs work has remained a mystery, but a new study has revealed an important clue that may have implications for other fields of research.</p>
<p>First described by Stefano Lorenzini in 1678, the ampullae of Lorenzini are visible as small pores in the skin around the head and on the underside of sharks, skates, and rays (known as elasmobranchs, a subclass of cartilaginous fish). Each pore is open to the environment and is connected to a set of electrosensory cells by a long canal filled with a clear, viscous jelly.</p>
<p>In the new study, published May 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>, a team of researchers from UC Santa Cruz, University of Washington, and the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason investigated the properties of this jelly. They found that the jelly is a remarkable proton-conducting material, with the highest proton conductivity ever reported for a biological material. Its conductivity is only 40 times lower than the current state-of-the-art proton-conducting polymer (Nafion), said corresponding author Marco Rolandi, associate professor of electrical engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The observation of high proton conductivity in the jelly is very exciting," Rolandi said. "We hope that our findings may contribute to future studies of the electrosensing function of the ampullae of Lorenzini and of the organ overall, which is itself rather exceptional."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Weak signals<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>The integration of signals from several ampullae allows sharks, skates, and rays to detect changes in the electric field as small as 5 nanovolts per centimeter. But how such weak signals are transmitted from the pore to the sensory cells has long been a matter of debate. The researchers speculate that sulfated polyglycans in the jelly may contribute to its high proton conductivity.</p>
<p>Proton conductivity is the ability of a material or solution to conduct protons (positive hydrogen ions). In a system with very many ordered hydrogen bonds, such as a hydrated hydrophilic polymer, proton conduction can occur along chains of these bonds, Rolandi explained. In technological applications, proton conductors such as Nafion can be used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.</p>
<p>"The first time I measured the proton conductivity of the jelly, I was really surprised," said first author Erik Josberger, an electrical engineering doctoral student in Rolandi's group at UW. "I didn't expect a natural material to approach the proton conductivity of an engineered material like Nafion."</p>
<p>The new findings may be of interest to researchers in materials science and other fields. Applications of the discovery could include unconventional sensor technology, Rolandi said.</p>
<p>In addition to Rolandi and Josberger, the coathors of the paper include Pegah Hassanzadeh, and Yingxin Deng, doctoral students in the Rolandi group at the University of Washington; Joel Sohn at UC Santa Cruz; and Michael Rego and Chris Amemiya of the Benaroya Research Institute in Seattle.</p>

The fact she had a hard time communicating and relating to other people was part of her disorder.</p>
<p>But that changed, says Del Rosario, when she discovered soccer.</p>
<p>Now a goalie on the UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s soccer team, Del Rosario (Oakes &#8217;17, environmental studies) says the sport &#8220;helped me build skills that weren&#8217;t natural to me. They built me as a person.&#8221;</p>
<p>She learned to talk to people, to socialize, to appreciate the support of her teammates through tough times. It also made her a better student.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out here now doing things my parents never thought I would do,&#8221; she says of her time at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of the reason Del Rosario helped organize a free soccer workshop for the children of students living in Family Student Housing&#8212;or any child of students or faculty, for that matter. She wants others to get a taste of the skills she learned from the sport.</p>
<p>The event was May 15 on the Oakes Field and included skill exercises, coaching, and games led by members of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s women&#8217;s soccer team.</p>
<p>This year, the team won the conference title for the NCAA Division III Great South Athletic Conference and advanced to the NCAA national championship tournament. It also won the National Soccer Coaches Association of America&#8217;s Team Scholar Award with a cumulative GPA of 3.35&#8212;the highest in the UC system, according to coach Emily Scheese, who earned a Ph.D. in literature from UC Santa Cruz in 2012.</p>
<p>The squad is peopled with students majoring in subjects from creative writing to engineering. Many excelled in their club and high school soccer teams. But what sets the group apart is that for 12 weekends of the year, the team goes into the community to coach soccer clinics for local kids. Partnered with the Aptos Tide soccer club, the athletes not only teach skills but also help participants gain confidence and make friends. About 100 students from ages 4 to 12 participated this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see someone who goes from barely wanting to dribble the ball to someone who, at the end of practices, is out there dribbling and playing and laughing,&#8221; Del Rosario says. &#8220;Seeing them happy makes me happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing on a wind-swept soccer field on the UC Santa Cruz campus after a rigorous practice, Scheese says the team is a cohesive, hard-working group that has gone beyond expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re Division III so we don&#8217;t have scholarships,&#8221; Scheese says. &#8220;All the women are here for the love of the game. They are basically volunteering to play a sport with people they love, on a campus they love and want to represent.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a critical hire for the campus, and the committee is determined to identify a finalist who can help lead UC Santa Cruz to greater prominence. We need strong candidates and a pool that reflects the value we place on diversity in all the richness that word conveys: academic discipline, professional experience, background, life experience, geography, and personal qualities. Settling for less is not an option.</p>
<p>Details about the search will continue to be <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/cpevc-search/index.html">posted online</a>, and the committee will continue to welcome nominations, comments, and concerns. You may contact any member of the search committee or Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni.

<p>Projects ranged from renovating the Quarry Amphitheater to graduate student internships to a childhood cancer initiative. All 10 colleges had projects, as did divisions, athletics, faculty and staff, and many others.</p>
<p>(For a round-up of videos, social media, and special reports visit the <a href="https://storify.com/ucsc/giving-day-may-11-2016">Storify Giving Day page</a>.)</p>
<p>Generous donors provided matching funds on projects close to their hearts, as well as "challenge" bonuses for projects with the most donors during certain hours.</p>
<p>All donors, including those who made on-the-spot micro-donations, were welcomed and appreciated. &#8220;A hundred pennies makes a dollar!&#8221; one young fundraiser called out to a group of passing students on campus, who were invited to spin a wheel, win prizes, and dine on cupcakes at Giving Day "pop-up parties" while considering their donation options.</p>
<p>Gifts came in the thousands of dollars to the tens. No gift was considered too small&#8212;and the impact of the sum total was felt all across campus. As of the official end of Giving Day, just before the clock struck midnight on May 11, the official tally was $339,276.</p>
<p>But the gift-giving took place at such a high volume, and so late in the game, that the final figures are still being calculated.</p>
<p>Giving Day, with the motto &#8220;Game on, Give on!,&#8221; unfolded in real time, much like a spirited basketball game or heated political race.</p>
<p>The action took place second by second, and a watchful &#8220;audience&#8221; of online viewers could see it all <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu">at a highly interactive web page that is being updated even now</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In the blink of an eye</strong></p>
<p>The numbers changed so rapidly that the latest, greatest figure could become "old news" in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like election night,&#8221; remarked Keith Brant, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s vice chancellor of University Relations. &#8220;I&#8217;m watching the returns. I&#8217;ve been watching this since midnight &#8230; What&#8217;s exciting is all the work that has gone into it from all corners of the campus&#8212; all the projects, all the people,&#8221; Brant said.</p>
<p><strong>A virtual world of giving</strong></p>
<p>The campus got the word out far and wide on video and social media, as well as an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1699859590272167/?active_tab=highlights">event page on Facebook</a>, which gave donors and project supporters a venue to express their gratitude within seconds after receiving gift commitments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woohoo! $2,855 had been donated to the Silver Slug Award staff scholarship when I checked a few moments ago,&#8221; proclaimed Mary Wells of the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association. The award will be given to current and retired staff and their dependents studying at UC Santa Cruz who need financial assistance. Wells and two fellow donors, Dave Kirk and Sharon Dirnberger, provided a 1:1 match up to $6,500 for gifts made on Giving Day.</p>
<p>The playing field was any place where a donor could get a WiFi connection. And yet the emotional focus of Giving Day was the UC Santa Cruz campus, where fundraisers staged &#8220;pop-up parties&#8221; at Quarry Plaza, McHenry Library, and other locations.</p>
<p>Later, the action moved to downtown Santa Cruz, where Mission Hill Creamery owner David Kumec (College Eight '91, economics) served up specially made &#8220;Banana Slug" ice cream and the trendy L&#250;pulo Craft Beer House had a Giving Day-themed evening bash.</p>
<p>Up at Quarry Plaza on campus, an enthusiastic crowd gathered on Wednesday morning, including UC Santa Cruz Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway.</p>
<p>By noon, the donations were already edging &#160;close to $200,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is amazing,&#8221; Galloway said, reviewing the latest figures. &#8220;I know we had some expectations. We wanted Giving Day to be a focus for the whole campus, but this is remarkable. I also really like the number of donors that are coming in today. That was the real goal. To try to get more people involved with giving.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>First-time philanthropists</strong></p>
<p>For many students, Giving Day was the chance to become philanthropists for the first time ever. The specific amount was not the point.</p>
<p>Some students made on-the-spot contributions, pooling loose change, turning jeans pockets inside out. All the gift givers came away smiling after having a chance to spin the wheel to win a Sammy sticker, a T-shirt, or a temporary Sammy tattoo.</p>
<p>Esther Hu and Kianna Mark, both 19, were at the plaza, braving the drizzle and dancing with a shamelessly photo-bombing Sammy the Slug. They were raising funds for the Haluan Hip-Hop Dance Troupe, which hosts an annual urban dance showcase called <a href="http://enroutesc.com">En Route.</a></p>
<p>Hu (College Nine, &#8217;19, history of art and visual culture,) and Mark (College Nine, &#8217;18, computer science,) said outside contributions help sustain the group. &#8220;We&#8217;re the only competitive hip-hop dance troupe at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Hu noted. &#8220;It takes a lot of funds to buy costumes, work together, go to different cities. We do everything&#8212;all our own fundraising. And we are our own staff for the dance showcase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside contributions will help the troupe in its mission &#8220;to show the Santa Cruz area what urban dance is and bring it to life here,&#8221; Mark said. &#8220;We want to show everyone how much we love urban dance. And Haluan is family to us.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A passion for giving</strong></p>
<p>Giving Day was also a chance for students to express their concerns, their vision, and their campus priorities. Sami Chen (Kresge '16, Earth sciences) made an on-the-spot donation to Girls In Engineering, a 5-day summer camp that invites middle school girls from underserved communities to campus to learn about computer science and engineering topics through fun activities, and to explore STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) academic and career pathways.</p>

<p>"How do we change this culture," Galloway asked. "This isn't about policy changes or law changes. It's about behavior changes. How do we act? We have a chance to make a difference."</p>
<p>Galloway noted that many women faculty have experienced and survived sexual harassment through their careers, saying &#8220;it does not need to be that way in the future.&#8221; A major culture shift &#8220;won&#8217;t be easy,&#8221; she acknowledged, adding she is optimistic because of new UC-wide policies regarding sexual assault and sexual violence and widespread campus and public attention on the issue. "Things have changed."</p>
<p>When she <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html">first announced the town hall</a> in late March, Galloway said, &#8220;We, as faculty, must do more than comply with mere law or university policy. Indeed, compliance to these standards is a basic job requirement. Sexual harassment isn't just a compliance problem; it is a culture problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>In emotional comments, students and faculty described their frustration with past practices that led to minor sanctions even when harassing behavior was investigated and found to have taken place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to change the culture that makes it safe for this behavior to continue,&#8221; one longtime faculty member said after asking if any faculty member had ever lost their job following an investigation.</p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;no,&#8221; Galloway said, also noting that under current policies faculty discipline is a lengthy process. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we as faculty need to come together and not tolerate this kind of behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Formerly, conversations about sexual violence, harassment, and prevention were only in regard to women, she said. &#8220;We relegated it to the Women's Center and tended to blame the victim. We no longer blame the victim and we won't tolerate &#8216;minor acts.&#8217;&#8221;&#160; She also acknowledged that &#8220;this issue is much broader and affects people throughout our community&#8212;not just women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galloway announced that she has approved funding to add more investigators to the Title IX office, which investigates complaints of sexual violence and sexual assault involving campus affiliates.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that members of the campus community can seek confidential assistance and advice at the CARE office, <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu">care.ucsc.edu</a>, and report incidents and receive help from UC Santa Cruz police.</p>
<p>She called on faculty and the academic senate to join her in forming a work group of faculty, staff, and students to develop changes and move the campus community beyond mere compliance to a true culture change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, it is about changing behavior. We need to start the conversation.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html</url><title>Campus message announcing the town hall</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/beyond-compliance-next-steps.html</url><title>Beyond Compliance: Next Steps</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://safe.ucsc.edu</url><title>Resources for sexual violence prevention and response</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a75a50b18072701713dacb13bfe878d7"><name>beyond-compliance-next-steps</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beyond Compliance: Next Steps</title><summary>Late Tuesday afternoon, members of the campus community came together for a productive discussion on what it would take for us to go beyond compliance—changing our campus culture to eliminate sexual harassment and sexual violence.

<p>The campus earned an award for its lighting retrofit and optimization in the McHenry Library; an award for its carbon neutrality roadmap; and an award for its sustainability minor and Sustainability Living Undergraduate Research Program (SLURP).</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a proud moment for Banana Slugs,&#8221; Director of Sustainability Elida Erickson said. &#8220;We are being recognized by our peers on a statewide level for innovative work in both academic and operational areas of campus sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>The awards, now in their 12th year, recognize innovations at UC and the California State University that further campus energy efficiency and sustainable operations.</p>
<p>The campus will receive the awards at the conference, held from June 27 to July 1 at CSU Fullerton.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings: Lighting Design/Retrofit</strong><br/>
 <em>McHenry Library Lighting Retrofit and Optimization</em></p>
<p>Staff members with the McHenry Library and the campus energy office developed a demand-based lighting system in the book stacks. The stacks tend to only be occupied for brief intervals, but were illuminated for long periods of the day.</p>
<p>Sensors can now detect when a person is walking through the stacks and boost the amount of light. When no motion is detected, the lights dim down to a low level. Additionally, library lights were outfitted with LED bulbs, reducing the amount of electricity.</p>
<p>Sarah Gilchrist and Chuck Dittrick from Physical Plant worked collaboratively with McHenry library staff, including Marcus Thayer, to make this project a success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate the work of all involved in this project,&#8221; University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell said. &#8220;In addition to the significant energy savings, the quality of light in the stacks is much improved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The total project should save about 407 megawatt hours, translating to a 70 metric ton reduction in CO2.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Innovations</strong><br/>
 <em>Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality by 2025</em></p>
<p>Just as UC President Janet Napolitano announced a systemwide initiative to be carbon-neutral by 2025, UC Santa Cruz was needing to updated its energy and climate action plans. To meet all this new goals, campus sustainability leaders decided to develop a comprehensive Climate and Energy Strategy.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be wrong to think it&#8217;s a stack of paper in a three-ring binder.</p>
<p>Climate Action Manager Christina Thomure and Campus Energy Manager Patrick Testoni worked with consultants and more than 125 staff, faculty, and students to develop a roadmap to carbon neutrality that&#8217;s backed by a dynamic computer program that can alter recommendations based on changes in energy market conditions, campus planning, and improvements in best practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project exemplifies the collaboration and planning needed to realize UC&#8217;s carbon neutrality goals,&#8221; Testoni said. &#8220;It also serves as a leading example of how sustainability goals are fiscally responsible, if integrated into short term and long term campus planning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carbon Neutrality isn&#8217;t a lofty, expensive concept&#8212;it is integral to our campus&#8217;s financial, educational, and research mission. Our roadmap confirms this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team working on the Climate and Energy Strategy identified 350 energy conservation measures in 50 buildings; 20 photovoltaic, solar thermal and fuel cell projects; 12 distinct system-level energy conservation measures; and an additional 700 potential energy conservation measures across other buildings.</p>
<p>The roadmap suggests the campus look to install enough solar panels to generate about 3.7 megawatts of electricity, and exit cap and trade in 2021 and focus on biogas purchases.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve identified our top three scenarios and are working to optimize those strategies by identifying additional onsite projects that have a net positive value,&#8221; Thomure said. &#8220;This will be an ongoing process as we move closer to the neutrality date, and we now have a flexible tool to help us adapt to changing market conditions and identify the most cost-effective strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability in Academics: Science, Technology, Engineering and Math</strong><br/>
 <em>UCSC Sustainability Studies minor and Sustainable Living Undergraduate Research Program</em></p>
<p>Recognizing that the rapidly-growing and linked ecological and social crises arising from stresses on supplies of energy, water, and food is among the most critical challenges for the next 50 years, College Eight at UC Santa Cruz launched an interdisciplinary minor in sustainability studies.</p>
<p>The minor, established in 2014, is designed to be a complement to students&#8217; majors, allowing them to broaden their applied skills and knowledge, and their ability to analyze and understand complex systems and their interactions through society and the environment.</p>
<p>"Our goal in the minor is for students to develop the capability to analyze, understand and address &#8217;wicked problems&#8217;&#8212;those whose causes arise at the intersection of social and natural forces, and whose solution requires integration across sectors, fields and disciplines,&#8221; said College Eight Provost Ronnie Lipschutz.</p>
<p>As part of the minor, the college also supports the Sustainable Living Systems Undergraduate Research Program (SLURP). Projects include developing a tiny &#8216;ecotopia&#8217; house in collaboration with Cabrillo College; an 18-month feasibility study of a phased conversion of campus shuttles and vanpools from gasoline and diesel to electric vehicles recharged by a campus solar PV system; and developing a sophisticated, interactive, neighborhood scale microgrid.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http:/http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/water-award.html</url><title>Campus wins best practice award for drought planning and water savings</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ac1218c38072701713dacb1341bf42f2"><name>bias-response</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Response team takes on bias, hate incidents</title><summary>The campus is developing one of the first programs of its kind to take such a proactive and comprehensive approach to hate and bias incidents. </summary><keywords>bias, response, team, inclusive, diversity</keywords><start-date>1463173200000</start-date><display-name>Bias Response Program</display-name><path>/2016/05/bias-response</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/bias-response</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1463175746407</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463176583562</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cheri O'Neil</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/bias-response-500px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/bias-response-500px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>bias-response-500px.jpeg</name><display-name>bias-response-500px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>107770</file-size><width>404</width><height>604</height></image><image-alt>Students walking across campus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/bias-response-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/bias-response-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>bias-response-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>bias-response-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>5774</file-size><width>84</width><height>84</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students on campus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The new Bias Response Program has three themes:&#160;community engagement and education; campus resources; and referral to appropriate campus units for possible review and possible disciplinary action.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Bias Response Program seeks to support students through expanded collaboration</article-subhead><article-text><p>Members of the UC Santa Cruz community have been encouraged for several years to report hurtful acts expressing hostility or bias on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, disability, place of origin, religion, and more, on the <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu">Report Hate</a> website.</p>
<p>Now, this online reporting tool is expanding to become one of the first programs of its kind to take such a proactive and comprehensive approach to hate and bias incidents. Students will be encouraged to report possible hate crimes directly to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, and the <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu/response-team/index.html">Bias Response Team</a> will be the first responder to bias-related incidents.</p>
<p>Intentional collaboration forms the backbone of the Bias Response Program, said Sheree Marlowe, UC Santa Cruz campus diversity officer, who is leading the effort through the Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (ODEI).</p>
<p>&#8220;The three themes for the new program,&#8221; she said, &#8220;are community engagement and education, campus resources, and referral to appropriate campus units for possible review and possible disciplinary action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sue Matthews, associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services, calls it &#8220;a terrific shift, insofar as it will allow one office to be the repository of all bias- and climate-related incidents that have an impact upon our students and our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The responses to these incidents should vary depending on the circumstances, she said, from private consultation to outreach with campus partners to possible disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Expanding with the program is the community response team that&#8217;s being created to reach out to students to provide education, support, and appropriate services. There&#8217;s also an effort to make a direct connection to the new Restorative Justice Program led by Vicki Duval, from Colleges, Housing and Educational Services.</p>
<p>Sometimes when students report incidents, Marlowe said, they just want to be heard and to notify the campus that such incidents are taking place in our community. In those cases, reports will be taken just as they always have. In cases where broader engagement is needed, more people will be brought in to respond directly to the confidential report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s an incident that targets the Latino/a or Chicano/a community,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I would reach out first to the students, find out what they want&#8212;and if they feel like the incident affects a broader constituency, I&#8217;d reach out to the leaders of the El Centro Chicano Latino Resource Center to ask if they&#8217;d be part of the broader response. That is the piece that has not taken place directly in the process up until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from using campus resources, Marlowe said, &#8220;The other big change is that we&#8217;re going to be more intentional in telling students that hate crimes need to be reported directly to UC police department. When there&#8217;s been a physical assault, and an immediate response is needed, we need them to contact the police department directly so they can get help right away&#8212;not fill out a form on the website.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can an assault be elevated to a hate crime? In one example, Marlowe said, if an individual hits a student, that may be a crime of assault, but if that individual hits a student and uses a racial slur at the same time, it may be elevated to a hate crime because the incident targeted a protected class based on race.</p>
<p>In another example, she said, &#8220;If someone writes graffiti, that&#8217;s a violation of the student code of conduct, but if the graffiti targets a classification or has a Nazi symbol, for instance, then it may be enhanced to a hate-or-bias related violation.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she works to develop the program this spring, Marlowe emphasizes the importance of taking the time to educate and engage the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a huge part of this,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and the community response team is key. The ultimate goal, of course, is to have a huge impact on the lives of students and create a safe space for them.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bbb322828072701713dacb130134f7e9"><name>jan-cloud-outstanding-staff-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The puzzle master</title><summary>Arts division assistant dean Jan Cloud is this year's Outstanding Staff Award Honoree.

In fact, she loves jumping out of clouds.</p>
<p>In honor of her husband&#8217;s 65th birthday this year, she willingly leaped from a plane and parachuted 18,000 feet through the air over the city of Marina.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a huge free fall before they pulled the (parachute),&#8221; she recalled with glee. &#8220;All the skin on your face goes &#8216;blibble-blibble-blibble!&#8217; I looked like a Shar-Pei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloud, in other words, has an indomitable sense of fun and adventure, with fearlessness to match. But here at UC Santa Cruz, she is also well-known for her kindness, diligence, professionalism, and her love for her work at the Arts Division, where she serves as assistant dean.</p>
<p>Now she is getting campus-wide recognition for all of her contributions to&#160;UC Santa Cruz. After 25 years of excellent work on campus, she is being honored with this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award.</p>
<p>This award, given jointly by the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council and the Staff Advisory Board, recognizes staff members who go "above and beyond" to help students or colleagues, improve programs and contribute to the university&#8217;s intellectual and physical environment.</p>
<p>Cloud will be honored at the annual staff appreciation picnic, which will take place 11:15 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 19, on the East Field.</p>
<p>The colleagues who recommended Cloud for the award were united in their praise for her. But a few of them seemed downright crestfallen that Cloud has decided to retire this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;She possesses tremendous foresight and applies that in service of the Division division in ways that are too numerous to mention,&#8217;&#8217; remarked professor Michael Chemers, director of Digital Arts and New Media at UCSC, before concluding his letter on a more somber note: &#8220;It is with terrible regret that I contemplate her retirement at the end of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloud agrees that leaving the job will be bittersweet.</p>
<p>But as much as she enjoys her work, she thinks it&#8217;s time to focus on some other things &#8211;&#8212; her bucket list, for instance, starting with that wild jump from an airplane over Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s great to go out on a high note.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The Outstanding Staff Award) caught me by surprise, I have to admit,&#8221; Cloud said. &#8220;When I found out, I said, &#8216;What? Aw, gosh!&#8217; It has been such a wonderful place for me. Yes, it&#8217;s time to start a new chapter, but on the other hand, I really love this job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friends and colleagues spoke about the complexity and difficulty of Cloud&#8217;s job. Cloud, among other things, supports professional growth, mentors other staff members, and advises divisional and department staff as well as faculty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never one to seek the spotlight, Jan knows where every dollar is, how to help ensure that a promising faculty hire accepts our offer, and the most certain path to shepherd a new program into existence,&#8221; wrote co-worker Scotty Brookie, who oversees IT activities for the Arts Division.</p>
<p>She also serves as a strong advocate for the Arts Division, which has changed and grown since she started work there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the division has really come into its own as far as being an equal partner of the other academic divisions,&#8217;&#8217; she said. Cloud was thrilled, for example, when the Arts Division launched a new arts and design major focusing on games and playable media.</p>
<p>A native Southern Californian, Cloud wound up in Santa Cruz in the early 1990s because her husband took a job out here.</p>
<p>She had no idea that the enjoyable job she found up on campus would last as long as it has.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the first day, working with those little Macintosh computers&#8212; &#8211; the little square guys,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;Remember those? Today, you would look at these things and say, &#8216;are Are you kidding me?&#8217; but that was considered huge technology then. It just cracks me up, looking back at the kinds of things we did. And we were using typewriters then. You make a typo, and it&#8217;s, &#8216;Oh, no, time to use the yellow Wite-Out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she stayed here because the work continued to inspire and fascinate her year after year.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was so much opportunity for personal and professional growth," she said. "And there were so many interlocking pieces. I think that is one of the things that made my job so interesting. I&#8217;m really going to miss it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bbf3cba98072701713dacb13cf16a69c"><name>just-data</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Conference to explore questions of precision medicine, bio-data, and ethics </title><summary>Leaders in genomics, health and informatics, civil rights, bioethics, indigenous rights, science policy, and the social study of health and medicine will gather at UC Santa Cruz this week for a workshop that aims to broaden the public discussion of big data and health.</summary><start-date>1463442300000</start-date><display-name>Just Data</display-name><path>/2016/05/just-data</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/just-data</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1463442196037</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463504102487</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/jenny-reardon-250.png</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/jenny-reardon-250.png</link><site>news</site><name>jenny-reardon-250.png</name><display-name>jenny-reardon-250.png</display-name><file-size>137334</file-size><width>250</width><height>331</height></image><image-alt>jenny reardon</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/precision-med-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/precision-med-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>precision-med-80.jpg</name><display-name>precision-med-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>5520</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>precision medicine graphic </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor Jenny Reardon</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/david-haussler-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/david-haussler-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-250.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>78859</file-size><width>250</width><height>331</height></image><image-alt>david haussler</image-alt><image-caption>Professor David Haussler</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Leaders in genomics, health and informatics, civil rights, bioethics, indigenous rights, science policy, and the social study of health and medicine will gather at UC Santa Cruz this week for a workshop that aims to broaden the public discussion of big data and health.</p>
<p>Attendees of &#8220;<a href="https://justdataucsc.wordpress.com/">Just Data? Justice, Knowledge and Care in an Age of Precision Medicine</a>,&#8221; organized by the <a href="http://scijust.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Science and Justice Research Center</a>, plan to focus on ethical and legal questions about privacy and informed consent and also care, trust, and knowledge in an age of biomedical data. The anticipated outcome is a report that will seek to help set an agenda for national policies regarding big bio-data and precision medicine <span>that make questions of social justice central to the discussions.</span></p>
<p>The foundation of precision medicine is based on using massive amounts of data&#8212;deeply personal data at the genomic level&#8212;to revolutionize healthcare with the goal of curing cancer and other diseases. However, ethical questions arise over who owns the data and what can be done with it.</p>
<p>Precision medicine and bio-data also promise to play a central role in a fundamental transformation of institutions, one in which digitized data move to the heart of decision-making practices&#8212;in science, law, policing, and medicine.</p>
<p>This is happening, conference organizers say, at a time when social inequalities are the widest in U.S. history and the premium on trust relationships is at its highest.</p>
<p>Kicking off the session Wednesday afternoon will be David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genomics Institute</a>, and Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology and director of the Science and Justice Research Center.&#160;</p>
<p>Some of the questions participants will tackle are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens to trust in medicine and patient outcomes when data portals, not doctors, deliver health information, and when health data is used to understand one&#8217;s risk for disease today, but used in lawsuits or a national security investigations tomorrow?</li>
<li>What happens to our ability to think about disease, care for patients, and address public health challenges when access to data expands exponentially for some (and not others)?</li>
<li>What do we need to understand and what should we do if we want better knowledge, better care and more just, equitable worlds to be the guiding goals of open, big data approaches to health?</li>
</ul>
<p>The conference is co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health, the UCSC Genomics Institute, and the <a href="http://www.ucnorthbioethicscollaboratory.org/">UC North Bioethics Collaboratory</a>, a collaboration of University of California bioethics researchers.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://justdataucsc.wordpress.com/</url><title>Complete event information</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://scijust.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UCSC Science and Justice Research Center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UCSC Genomics Institute</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bbf403888072701713dacb13d2dde4b9"><name>sammy-slug-camp</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Registration opens for Sammy Slug Summer Camp</title><summary>The program, offered through the UC Santa Cruz Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports, goes in one-week sessions from June 27 to Aug. 19. </summary><keywords>summer camp, opers, sports, arts, crafts, singing, dancing, hiking,</keywords><start-date>1463418000000</start-date><display-name>Summer camp</display-name><path>/2016/05/sammy-slug-camp</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/sammy-slug-camp</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1463442209966</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463696792987</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/slug-camp-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/slug-camp-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slug-camp-400px.jpg</name><display-name>slug-camp-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>71306</file-size><width>400</width><height>797</height></image><image-alt>Camper on a climbing wall</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Registration is open for Sammy Slug Summer Camp, a recreational summer program for boys and girls entering 1st through 6th grades.</p>

One label pictures a set of gangrenous toes, another a gnarly-looking eyeball.</p>
<p>Those packages, designed to warn consumers about the health hazards of smoking, are at the heart of Crosbie&#8217;s research.</p>
<p>Why does a tobacco company&#8217;s vow to sue countries that legislate these kinds of cigarette labels stop their use in one country but not in another?</p>
<p>The answer, says Dr. Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine and director of UC San Francisco&#8217;s Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, &#8220;is a very hot area in global public health and has implications way beyond tobacco.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crosbie, 32, a fourth-year graduate student in politics, is animated as he describes his current research. Always interested in how corporations impact policy-making, he came into the world of tobacco control after getting a job with Glantz at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. Later, he was drawn to UC Santa Cruz because of its interdisciplinary approach.</p>
<p>A tenacious researcher&#8212;Crosbie once returned four times to the same government office in an attempt to secure an interview&#8212;he began to look into tobacco companies&#8217; legal actions against &#8220;plain packaging&#8221; laws in Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay. Plain packaging laws ban tobacco-company logos, limit brand names to small, standardized type, and require large health-warning images and text on cigarette packages.</p>
<p>In 2011, Crosbie says, Australia passed a plain-packaging law and tobacco giant Philip Morris International quickly sued. It charged that Australia had to compensate the company because it had taken away its branding and logo. The corporation, Crosbie says, used a bilateral trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong as a basis for the suit, which allowed a corporation to sue a government over alleged trademark seizure. Under the U.S.-Australia trade agreement, the company could not file suit against a government.</p>
<p>In addition, five countries&#8212;Ukraine, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, and Cuba&#8212;also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against Australia&#8217;s cigarette packaging laws, says Crosbie. Reports from Reuters and Bloomberg News on the case said Philip Morris was covering some legal costs for the Dominican Republic while British American Tobacco Plc. was doing the same for Ukraine and Honduras.</p>
<p>For Crosbie the question was: Why did Australia and the small country of Uruguay stand up to these legal challenges while New Zealand dropped its proposed plain-packaging regulations in the face of what it believed would be a protracted and expensive legal fight?</p>
<p>Digging through archives, poring over online documents, and interviewing officials in each of the three countries, Crosbie says his research shows a trio of reasons.</p>
<p>Comparing two similar countries, Australia and New Zealand, Crosbie says he found that government ideology is important. In Australia, the government was center-left while New Zealand was governed by a center-right party.</p>
<p>In addition, bureaucratic leadership influenced the response to a legal threat. Australia&#8217;s health minister, for instance, was &#8220;a bold, strong, and courageous&#8221; lawyer, Crosbie says. New Zealand&#8217;s health minister, by contrast, was strong but came from a minority party that was part of a coalition government and thus had less power.</p>
<p>The third component was health advocacy, Crosbie found. In Australia, health advocates were funded independently. In New Zealand, those organizations were subsidized by the government &#8220;so they are constrained in what they can say,&#8221; Crosbie says.</p>
<p>Crosbie&#8217;s findings, says Glantz, &#8220;are going to have a lot of impact in terms of leading to a more rational policy-making process around these issues and also have implications around trade policies,&#8221; which may include so-called investor state dispute provisions that allow corporations to directly sue governments.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bench on Science Hill on the UC Santa Cruz campus, Crosbie says his findings are important because, with billions of dollars at stake, cigarette companies fear the domino effect of tobacco-control laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;For tobacco companies, threatening (to sue) a government is cheap,&#8221; Crosbie says, &#8220;and they have been doing it for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crosbie is headed back to UC San Francisco&#8217;s Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education for a post-doc fellowship in June and, depending on the outcome of two upcoming court cases against Australia and Uruguay, may write a book based on his research.</p>
<p>He believes his investigation not only has policy implications for cigarette companies but also for labeling of products that may affect health, from alcohol to junk food. That&#8217;s why, he says, it&#8217;s important to look carefully at trade policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t start paying attention to what happens domestically through the legislative process, you&#8217;re missing out on how these trade agreements affect policy,&#8221; he says.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c5c010128072701713dacb134014c17b"><name>pancreatic-cancer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Malignancy-associated gene network regulated by an RNA binding protein</title><summary>An extensive regulatory network associated with tumor metastasis was found in pancreatic cancer cells.</summary><keywords>Jeremy Sanford, pancreatic cancer, IGF2BP3, RNA binding proteins</keywords><start-date>1463673600000</start-date><display-name>Malignancy-associated gene network regulated by an RNA binding protein</display-name><path>/2016/05/pancreatic-cancer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/pancreatic-cancer</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1463606577727</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1463673818292</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/figure-2a-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/figure-2a-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-2a-400.jpg</name><display-name>figure-2a-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>42626</file-size><width>400</width><height>278</height></image><image-alt>microscope image of cancer cell</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/immunostain-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/immunostain-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>immunostain-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>immunostain-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17149</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>microscope image of cancer cell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>In pancreatic cancer cells, loss of IGF2BP3 reduced cell invasiveness and other factors associated with tumor progression and metastasis.

For now, it's known as IGF2BP3, which stands for "insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3."</p>
<p>IGF2BP3 is normally active in fetal tissue and undetectable in most adult tissue. But production of the protein is reactivated in many types of aggressive cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis in both solid tumors and leukemias. New findings from Sanford's lab at UC Santa Cruz, where he is an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, point toward a possible mechanism by which this protein drives metastasis.</p>
<p>In a study <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2816%2930528-9">published May 19 in <em>Cell Reports</em>,</a> Sanford and his collaborators identified an extensive malignancy-associated gene expression circuit regulated by IGF2BP3 in pancreatic cancer cells. "We haven't nailed down the details of the interactions, but it suggests a mechanism for how IGF2BP3 could drive metastasis by influencing the expression of genes involved in cancer biology," Sanford said.</p>
<p><strong>Gene regulation</strong></p>
<p>Gene expression involves several steps, and regulation can occur at different steps in the process. When a protein-coding gene is turned on, its DNA sequence gets copied into a messenger RNA molecule, which is then translated into a protein that carries out a specific function. Many regulatory factors control which genes get transcribed into messenger RNA and when. Less well understood are RNA binding proteins, such as IGF2BP3, which interact with the messenger RNA itself to regulate gene expression after transcription has occurred.</p>
<p>In the new study, Sanford's team identified a set of 164 messenger RNA targets regulated by IGF2BP3 in pancreatic cancer cells. They found that most of the targeted RNAs encode proteins that have some role in cancer biology, such as cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion.</p>
<p>IGF2BP3 had different effects on different targets, increasing the expression of some proteins and decreasing others. This dual activity may depend on how the protein interacts with an important gene-silencing pathway mediated by short pieces of RNA called microRNAs. MicroRNAs can help silence gene expression by binding to messenger RNA as part of a complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).</p>
<p>"It's basically a little molecular machine with a guidance system made of microRNA, and it silences genes by blocking translation of the messenger RNA," Sanford said. "When we mapped the positions where IGF2BP3 interacts, we noticed that many of them overlap with binding sites for RISC."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Silencing complex</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, IGF2BP3 may compete with microRNAs for binding sites on the messenger RNA, thereby interfering with the silencing complex. In other cases, IGF2BP3 appears to enhance the function of the RISC complex.</p>
<p>"We don't know the exact mechanism of how the IGF2BP3 protein interacts with the RISC complex, but it gives us a lot to investigate in terms of this interesting network of interactions," Sanford said. "It also suggests that therapeutic approaches to interfere with the interactions between IGF2BP3 and its targets might be effective to decrease the aggressiveness of certain tumors."</p>

<p>"I am willing to delay a decision about what we do with the program," Blumenthal said during opening remarks to the campus Academic Senate on May 18. "I want to see if (the committees studying NCAA athletics) can identify solutions to allow us to keep athletics going forward."</p>
<p>He said that simply asking the campus to fully fund the program&#8212;which will cost more next year because of new federal labor laws&#8212;places it in direct competition with academic priorities.</p>
<p>"There's no question that this is a difficult choice," he said.</p>
<p>The Academic Senate's Special Committee on Athletics submitted an interim report encouraging campus leaders to further study the NCAA program and sustainable funding models before any final decisions are made. The Senate unanimously approved the resolution.</p>
<p>A committee comprised of UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board members and alumni councilors is also drafting recommendations.</p>
<p>Blumenthal praised the NCAA program and its value to the campus.</p>

<p>The new&#160;<a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/trans-inclusive/.">trans-inclusive housing</a>&#160;option is the result of student activism that informed ongoing administrative discussions about how to better serve the trans community.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to set a whole different culture shift on campus where people recognize that this is a community that matters and needs a space to be themselves without fear,&#8221; said Jamie Joy, 22, a graduating senior who was a student member of the All-Gender Housing Task Force.</p>
<p>The task force made recommendations in June of 2015 for the establishment of two new trans-inclusive housing communities in fall quarter 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important for students to have a place on campus they call home,&#8221; said Jamie, who prefers to not use a last name.</p>
<p>Jamie, a double major in Community Studies and Feminist Studies, identifies as gender-fluid, nonconforming, nonbinary or genderqueer.</p>
<p>For students like Jamie, who was discovering an evolving gender and sexual identification when arriving on campus as a first-year student in 2012, the idea of living in a welcoming and safe environment is fundamental to academic success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living amongst other queer people made it easier to accept myself and to call my dorm room &#8216;home,&#8217;&#8221; Jamie said. &#8220;When I interacted with people who were transphobic, I lost that feeling of home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just over 203 colleges and universities have gender-inclusive housing or housing in which students can have a roommate of any gender, according to Trans Policy Clearinghouse, which is maintained by Campus Pride, a national nonprofit organization created by LGBTQ and ally students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has long offered students various room options based on academic pursuits, lifestyle preferences, backgrounds and hobbies, such as single or mixed gender, international living, creative arts, wellness and health, science and engineering, substance-free, 21 and older, and social justice. While students have had the option to request gender-neutral room options since 2009 and there are LGBTQIA-themed communities, this new trans-inclusive option seeks to provide a more intentionally supportive space for trans and gender-nonconforming students and their allies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is important because of the number of problems that transgender college students encounter on college campuses,&#8221; said Brian Arao, associate college administrative officer and housing liaison for trans-identified students. Students have reported discomfort and hostility from roommates that often misunderstand gender identity issues, which often leads to a sense of isolation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have heard from our students that at this point in time they feel it&#8217;s important to have critical mass in their communities, a place where there is understanding and acceptance among everyone on a floor rather than only a couple of people here and there,&#8221; Arao said.</p>
<p>New students who complete the supplemental application for trans-inclusive housing will have the opportunity to live together in the Merrill College residence halls. Continuing and transfer students will have the option to live in trans-inclusive housing at Redwood Grove apartments. These students may room together regardless of gender or legal gender and will likely join a mixed-gender floor or apartment and share common areas. For those trans and gender nonconforming students who prefer to live elsewhere, the university housing department will continue to work with them on an individual basis as it has for many years.</p>
<p>The reality is that people have varying level of preparedness to be inclusive and understanding, and students report that many still engage in behaviors that are transphobic, Arao said.</p>
<p>While trans-identified people are often included in a broader group relating to sexual orientation, their experiences are quite different. Their issues have often been marginalized, Arao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really homogenize this community,&#8221; Jamie said. &#8220;Not only did I identify myself as queer, but I had to identify whether it was my sexuality or gender identity that was queer. And, I realized it was both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie will be serving on the selection committee for the university&#8217;s new campuswide trans educator, a position created in part due to a student petition that circulated last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to be on the leading edge on these kinds of efforts,&#8221; Arao said. &#8220;There are still far fewer universities doing this kind of work than ones that are. What distinguishes our program is we really wanted to listen to our students in crafting a housing option that meets their needs as they have articulated them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a movement that has so much potential to impact not just trans and queer people but men and women who are impacted by gender norms,&#8221; Jamie said. "And, that&#8217;s everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although graduating in just a few weeks, Jamie says the movement has been a special journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been really blessed to be a part of it,&#8221; Jamie said. &#8220;The community has gone from feeling really empowered to exhausted to really fed up to filled with love and filled with anger. It&#8217;s been tumultuous journey these last few years. As I&#8217;m graduating, I feel like the generations behind me know what&#8217;s in their best interests and will be able to ask for what they really need to survive. I work with queer and trans youth also and there is a rise in visibility and vocality. It can go only go up from here."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://housing.ucsc.edu/trans-inclusive/</url><title>More about trans-inclusive housing</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cb470f4d8072701713dacb136f57ad47"><name>niels-bohr-professorship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz awarded Niels Bohr Professorship</title><summary>Award from the Danish National Research Foundation provides $5 million to fund research in theoretical astrophysics.</summary><keywords>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Niels Bohr Professorship, Center for Transient Astrophysics</keywords><start-date>1463756400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz awarded Niels Bohr Professorship</display-name><path>/2016/05/niels-bohr-professorship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/niels-bohr-professorship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1463699311016</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464813055244</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>76500</file-size><width>350</width><height>311</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25331</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (Photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>$5 million Danish research award will fund an international research collaboration in theoretical astrophysics</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Danish National Research Foundation has awarded a $5 million Niels Bohr Professorship to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is one of seven international scholars selected this year for the Niels Bohr Professorship Program, which aims to attract top international researchers to Danish Universities. The five-year award will support an international research collaboration in theoretical astrophysics led by Ramirez-Ruiz, who will divide his time between UC Santa Cruz and the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI) at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p><strong>Transient astrophysics</strong></p>
<p>The collaborative program, called the NBI Center for Transient Astrophysics, will focus on the physics of transient astronomical phenomena such as exploding stars and gamma-ray bursts. Astronomers are greatly expanding their capacity to detect and observe such transient phenomena through large survey projects. Ramirez-Ruiz has been working to develop the theoretical framework needed to interpret observations of astronomical transients and maximize the scientific yield of large survey projects.</p>
<p>At the University of Copenhagen, he will work with Professor Jens Hjorth, director of the Dark Cosmology Centre at NBI. Ramirez-Ruiz, a long-term associate at the center, was named affiliated professor of high energy astrophysics at NBI in 2014, and he has organized workshops and co-advises graduate students and postdocs at NBI.</p>
<p>"Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz is really an internationally renowned top scientist, and his research fits in perfectly with our research in the Dark Cosmology Centre," Hjorth said. "He primarily researches violent phenomena in the universe such as exploding supernovae, bursts of gamma radiation, black holes in the centers of galaxies, and other phenomena that change over time. He is a theorist and studies the phenomena using computer simulations, while a large part of our work is based on observations using both space telescopes and large, ground-based telescopes."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Strong community</strong></p>
<p>Both observations and theoretical calculations are necessary to advance the understanding of transient phenomena, and the NBI Center for Transient Astrophysics aims to build a strong community of theorists and observers. Hjorth and Ramirez-Ruiz have already engaged a core group of internationally acclaimed scientists and partner institutions committed to this endeavor.</p>
<p>"The center will create a collaborative theoretical and interpretive environment tied closely to the ongoing surveys," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "We will support and train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in an environment where exciting discoveries are occurring at a rapid pace."</p>
<p>He noted that transient objects have always played a crucial role in the development of astronomy and in the use of astronomical observations to illuminate new physics. The new center will address important long-standing problems in astrophysics, including how stars explode as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts; how stars end their lives and become compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes; how black holes grow in mass by ripping apart orbiting stars and swallowing the stellar debris; and what happens when two compact objects merge.</p>
<p>"These exotic and transient phenomena are spectacular probes of extreme physics at high energy and high density, and they are ideal test-beds for theories such as general relativity and alternative theories of gravity," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>His appointment as a Niels Bohr Professor will take effect in fall 2016.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is the second UC Santa Cruz professor to win a Niels Bohr Professorship. Anthropology professor Anna Tsing was awarded one in 2013, the first social scientist to be honored by the Danish National Research Foundaton.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/</url><title>Niels

ethnic group in the U.S.</article-subhead><article-text><p>Nirvikar Singh, UC Santa Cruz professor of economics and director of the Center for Analytical Finance, described the rapid economic success of Indians in the U.S. during a <a href="http://www.tiecon.org/session/?a=35">keynote address at TieCon 2016</a>, the largest conference dedicated to entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and Silicon Valley professionals attended the event organized earlier this month by The Indus Entrepreneur (Tie) Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Singh&#8217;s talk was based on his forthcoming book, <em>The Other One Percent: Indians in America.</em> People of Indian origin, including those born in India and the U.S. born, make up about 1 percent of the American population now, up from barely one-half percent in 2000, Singh said.&#160;</p>
<p>Median annual household income for Indian Americans in 2010 was $88,000, according to the Pew Research Center. That compares with $66,000 for Asian Americans and $49,800 for all U.S. households.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are Indians so successful,&#8221; Singh asked during his address on the conference&#8217;s final day. Three processes&#8212;selection, assimilation and entrepreneurship&#8212;have led to a rapid rise of a population from a poor, developing nation to the position of the highest-income and most-educated group in the world's most advanced nation, Singh said.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons he cited are: English language fluency, levels of education, selective immigration&#8211;with highly sought occupational skills favored&#8211;and stable family structures.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0888d0f8072701713dacb13ab23e1c3"><name>greg-omalley-slavetrade</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>History professor Greg O'Malley to create new public database about the slave trade</title><summary>With the help of a $220,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, UC Santa Cruz history professor Gregory O'Malley plans to add his research to one of the most utilized resources in the digital humanities.  &#13;

era.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On a typical day, over 1,000 visitors consult the website <a href="http://www.slavevoyages.org"><em><strong>Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database</strong></em></a>, one of the most utilized resources in the digital humanities. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 Drawing on four decades of archival research on five continents, it offers free public access to the details of every documented slave-trading voyage that carried enslaved people from Africa to the Americas.</p>
<p>Now in its seventh year with 35,000 documented voyages to date, the site has become the basic reference tool for anyone who studies the transatlantic slave trade&#8212;including teachers, genealogists, scientists, and scholars.<br/>
<br/>
 The Voyages web site is, however, limited in one key area. It only includes slave-trading voyages that crossed the Atlantic Ocean. But recent research has shown that arrival in the New World from Africa did not always mark the end of a captive&#8217;s journey&#8212;approximately 25 percent of arriving Africans actually soon boarded another ship for distribution within the Americas.<br/>
<br/>
 A significant piece of that new research was conducted by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history, Gregory O&#8217;Malley. His recent book documenting the intra-American slave trade, <em>Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</em>, has received multiple awards for helping to redraw the map of the forced African immigration during the slave trade era.<br/>
<br/>
 Now with the help of a $220,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a project titled <em>Final Passages: The Intra-American Slave Trade Database</em>, O&#8217;Malley plans to add his research to the Voyages database.<br/>
<br/>
 The project will create an interactive, free Web-based database about the slave trade within the Americas and integrate it into the Voyages site.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Part of this grant is to build a new interface to add to what we have, using the data I used to write my book,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;I built a database on my laptop to write the book, and now we want to make it a public resource.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I went through all of the port records from all of the British colonies in the Americas, in both the Caribbean and North American mainland, and I logged every shipment that carried enslaved people. It took a year and a half, and I found more than 7,600 shipments carrying hundreds of thousands of people.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Malley noted that another part of the NEH grant is to hire researchers to gather more information on places that haven&#8217;t been studied, such as the internal movement of slaves in Brazil. This includes research from his co-principal investigator on the grant, UC Irvine history professor Alex Borucki.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We want to add material that Alex used to write his book tracking slaves from Brazil to what is now Argentina and Uruguay,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley.<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Malley stressed how the Voyages slave-trading database has helped scholars understand the massive scale of the slave trade.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The fact that there are thousands of these shipments, and that traders in all kinds of business were also trading slaves, really indicates how ubiquitous slavery was in early American society,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley noted.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Each one of the shipments had merchants investing in slave trading, sailors in charge of controlling slaves on ship, dockworkers loading on and off the ship, printers printing advertisements for the slave trade&#8230;So to my mind, you realize that tens of thousands of people are involved in buying and selling people, and that&#8217;s really important to understanding how racism develops. I think engaging in or witnessing this business on a daily basis desensitized people to human suffering.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Malley said that the major goal for the 18-month project is to promote scholarly and public awareness of the role played by the African slave trade in the Atlantic world, which shaped several inland regions in the Americas and even the Latin American Pacific Rim.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I think what drew me to the colonial period was an interest in race relations as a core dilemma of American society,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley observed. &#8220;A lot of the foundations for that were located in the colonial period.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We are living in a country where black lives are often treated as if they didn&#8217;t matter, and it&#8217;s built on this trade of slaves,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley added. &#8220;This disregard for their welfare and well being is really important background for modern race relations. I think it shows we have a long history of devaluing black lives in American society.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

system’s last working foundry—has become a tradition on campus combining performance, ancient ritual, and hands-on hard work</article-subhead><article-text><p>Cowell College art major Katherine Randall perched anxiously on a high stool Tuesday afternoon as the result of six weeks of painstaking work awaited the outcome of the next 30 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work, a lot of tears,&#8221; she said over the roar of a venting hood as Arts Lecturer Sean M. Monaghan began melting 250 pounds of silicon bronze, which would be turned&#8212;barring unintentional cracks, holes or explosions&#8212;into sculptures created by Randall and 17 other students in his Art 188 class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully,&#8221; said Randall, who graduates in June, &#8220;it will all be worth it once it&#8217;s fully realized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Randall wasn&#8217;t the only nervous one in the crowd as about two dozen students and onlookers watched what has become a tradition at UC Santa Cruz: a bronze pour at the UC system&#8217;s last working foundry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an event that&#8217;s part performance and part ancient ritual with a lot of hands-on hard work mixed in. Outfitted in aluminized Kevlar jackets, aprons and gloves, Monaghan and his helpers first heated the bronze to a blazing 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit, then used a crane to lift the white-hot crucible of molten metal and pour what resembled a stream of liquid sunshine into molds students had made.</p>
<p>The molds themselves required weeks of work as the student sculptors crafted their designs out of wax, dipped the wax forms into ceramic slurry and then fired them in a kiln so that the poured metal would fill the empty spaces where the wax had been to create a 3-D sculpture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rite that has been going on almost continuously since the earliest years of UC Santa Cruz, when the first foundry began operating out of the Cowell Ranch&#8217;s old blacksmith&#8217;s barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very crude,&#8221; said Art Professor Emeritus Doyle Foreman of the first facility &#8212;and also something of a fire hazard. But it was a can-do time when pioneer faculty like Foreman, who began teaching in 1968, foraged for downed redwood and convinced construction workers to dump a tractor load of clay soil for students to use in their art projects. With the help of a $150,000 capital improvement grant, Foreman helped design a new, and safer, foundry, which was erected in 1975 behind the Theater Arts complex.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Foreman, 82, sat in the large metal building and watched a process he&#8217;d overseen for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wax is malleable. It&#8217;s very easy to manipulate,&#8221; said Foreman of the first phase of the sculpting process. &#8220;It&#8217;s like painting. It responds to you so there is a very personal kind of connection.&#8221; The material and the artist both evolve until an idea becomes physical, he said.</p>
<p>That kind of release of ideas through form gives students confidence, according to Foreman.</p>
<p>For Samuel Mora (Kresge &#8217;17, art), who had created a sculpture that he said reflected the duality of his personality&#8212;quiet at times and outgoing at other times&#8212;the process taught him not only patience but also about facing problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It teaches you that if something happens you can learn to work with it or work around it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something you can apply to life. It teaches you to be a better human.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pour, which required the choreographed work of five people including Monaghan&#8217;s studio research assistant Lucas Gasperik, ended with a burst of applause when a smiling and sweating Monaghan removed his welder&#8217;s helmet to announce with a smile: &#8220;And that&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monaghan (Kresge &#8217;83, art), who operates his own foundry business called Bronze Works Fine Arts Foundry in Santa Cruz, said, just like his students, he still gets a thrill from a pour event.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a birthday because you get to open the present you&#8217;ve been working on for six weeks,&#8221; said Monaghan, &#8220;and then, there it is: all your hopes and dreams.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d099b7bc8072701713dacb13e9d9595a"><name>rogoff-nsf-video</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Psychology professor featured in NSF video showcase 'STEM for All'</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz pyschology professor Barbara Rogoff's research is featured in the National Science Foundation 2016 "STEM for All" Video Showcase.</summary><start-date>1463785200000</start-date><display-name>Barbara Rogoff</display-name><path>/2016/05/rogoff-nsf-video</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/rogoff-nsf-video</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1463788614022</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465339399936</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/rogoff-210.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/rogoff-210.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rogoff-210.jpg</name><display-name>rogoff-210.jpg</display-name><file-size>53816</file-size><width>210</width><height>328</height></image><image-alt>barbara rogoff</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/rogoff-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/rogoff-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rogoff-80.jpg</name><display-name>rogoff-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>13334</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>barbara rogoff</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor Barbara Rogoff<a href="http://stemforall2016.videohall.com/presentations/693"><span></span></a><span></span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/nsf-video-showcase-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/nsf-video-showcase-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nsf-video-showcase-400.jpg</name><display-name>nsf-video-showcase-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>82637</file-size><width>400</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Public is invited to view, discuss, and vote for favorite video presentation</article-subhead><article-text><p><em>Update:Profesor Barbara Rogoff's "Learning by Observing" video received the most votes among the 156 short films in the National Science Foundation's Video Showcase.

<p>We are not yet aware of plans for a memorial but will convey that information when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Larry retired from UC Santa cruz in 2008 after serving as vice provost beginning in February 2003 and as a consultant to the campus for two years before that. Larry received his MBA from Brigham Young University in 1969. From 1969 to 1981, he held positions as manager and consultant in mostly private sector organizations providing support and direction in areas of institutional investment management, economic, analysis and corporate planning.</p>

<p>A record 43 percent of undergraduates voted in this year&#8217;s election. Of those, 63 percent were in favor of establishing a new undergraduate fee that would be approximately $90 per student per quarter. Undergraduate students will vote in spring 2017 on establishing a new student fee.</p>
<p>Additionally, two committees&#8212;one comprised of faculty and one comprised of UC Santa Cruz Foundation board members and alumni councilors&#8212;are looking at sustainable funding models for the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of this year&#8217;s opinion poll underscores that this is an important program for our campus,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;I look forward to considering sustainable funding models for this program so that it can be on secure financial footing for years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz offers NCAA Division III athletic teams in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s basketball, cross-country, soccer, swimming/diving, tennis, and volleyball; and women&#8217;s golf and track. All the teams will continue to compete next year.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 undergraduate students casts votes in the election that ran from May 11&#8211;17. Full election results can be <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/pdf/2016/athletics-opinion-poll.pdf">viewed online</a> later this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have enjoyed watching our scholar-athletes give their all both in the classroom and while competing in their chosen sport. I am proud to see that fellow students have demonstrated support for our program,&#8221; Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said. &#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that the attention&#8212;from faculty, community members, students and others&#8212;to NCAA athletics will further strengthen the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/pdf/2016/athletics-opinion-poll.pdf">opinion poll</a> asked students whether they would support a new student fee of about $90 per quarter ($270 per year) to support the current NCAA program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz leadership determined in 2014 that it would not be sustainable to fund the program for the years to come and offered funding through 2016&#8211;17 so that the program could try to transition to financial support from student fees.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e3d168a68072701713dacb13d260d053"><name>staff-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff contributions recognized with campus, systemwide awards</title><summary>In addition to the annual Outstanding Staff Award, two systemwide awards were given to UC Santa Cruz staff members.</summary><keywords>staff, work, award, contributions, sab</keywords><start-date>1464109200000</start-date><display-name>Staff awards</display-name><path>/2016/05/staff-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/staff-awards</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1464111031131</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464111374531</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/staff-award.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/staff-award.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>staff-award.jpeg</name><display-name>staff-award.jpeg</display-name><file-size>125025</file-size><width>404</width><height>604</height></image><image-alt>Jan Cloud with Sammy and chancellor</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jan Cloud,&#160;assistant dean of the Arts Division, with Chancellor George Blumenthal and Sammy.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/cucsa-award-500px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/cucsa-award-500px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>cucsa-award-500px.jpeg</name><display-name>cucsa-award-500px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>87125</file-size><width>504</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>CUCSA Chair-elect Rejeana Mathis (left), from UCLA, and&#160;CUCSA Chair Greta Carle-Halle, from UC Santa Barbara, presented Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni with the&#160;Outstanding Senior Leadership Award.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three UC Santa Cruz staff members were recognized for their contributions to campus at last week&#8217;s Staff Appreciate Picnic.</p>

(Photo courtesy of Soliculture)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Greenhouses have a long list of benefits: higher food production, less water use, less pesticide need, longer growing season, better working conditions. There&#8217;s a problem: they&#8217;re expensive, both to install and to operate. But thanks to solar technology developed at UC Santa Cruz, greenhouses are enjoying a new moment in the sun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.soliculture.com/">Soliculture</a>, a company based on technology developed in the Thin-Film Optoelectronics Laboratory of physics professor Sue Carter, has been busy explaining to growers the benefits of using their solar panels on greenhouses.</p>
<p>&#8220;To put it simply, Soliculture panels allow more power, more produce, more profits,&#8221; said Glenn Alers, CEO of Soliculture and adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>The panels themselves are not what you expect when you imagine a solar panel: they&#8217;re translucent, and they&#8217;re a bright shade of magenta.</p>
<p><strong>Solar concentrators<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>The idea to apply transparent solar panels to greenhouses came about as a happy accident. Carter and her research team were working on luminescent solar concentrators, which use a fluorescent dye to absorb light and make solar panels significantly more efficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;The concentrator dye absorbs the sunlight and then re-emits it as lower energy photons. This means you can use a lot fewer solar panels, because the absorber is doing the work,&#8221; explained Carter.</p>
<p>No system is perfectly efficient, and there&#8217;s always light that doesn&#8217;t get used by the solar panel and is lost. In this case, there was something interesting about the rosy-colored light being lost from the panels they were testing. This light wasn&#8217;t waste: it was fuel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that the red color of the light was exactly what you see in commercial grow lamps for plants,&#8221; Carter said.</p>
<p>Plants don&#8217;t use the entire spectrum of visible light for photosynthesis &#8211; grow lamps optimize the colors of light that plants actually use to grow. The solar panels developed in Carter&#8217;s lab absorbed green light and emitted red light to enhance the power generation of the solar cell &#8211; and the excess red light happened to fall exactly in the range of the spectrum that plants use.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to greenhouse adoption is cost, including the cost of installation and materials, and the ongoing cost to cool, heat and light the greenhouses. Using solar panels to generate electricity dramatically lowers the cost of powering a greenhouse. Carter and Soliculture are working now to show that a fully net-zero greenhouse is possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve recently gotten a lot of interest in our technology in Canada,&#8221; said Glenn Alers. &#8220;With such a short growing season combined with high electricity rates, the need for panels like ours makes perfect sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the U.S., installing a solar greenhouse makes even more economic sense because they qualify for federal tax breaks aimed at promoting solar power.</p>
<p>&#8220;California is one of the biggest users of greenhouses in the country &#8211; if not the biggest, and it will only get bigger,&#8221; said Carter, citing as two drivers the California drought and increased demand for organic produce.</p>
<p>As the price of solar panels continues to drop, crops that were once too costly to grow in greenhouses are likely to take root. Tomatoes and cucumbers are widely grown in greenhouses now, but lettuce and other crops could soon find a place there, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strawberry industry is starting to test greenhouses,&#8221; said Carter. &#8220;They also have the advantage of bringing the crop up higher, which makes it less physically challenging for pickers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In hotter regions, like California&#8217;s Central Valley, cooling becomes an issue. Growers use swamp coolers and blinds to block the sunlight. Here again, the color of the panels is helpful. Not only do the panels provide electricity to power swamp coolers, but the colored shading of the panels keeps greenhouses cooler and can eliminate the need for blinds.</p>
<p><strong>Green innovation</strong></p>
<p>Soliculture isn&#8217;t the only company seeing green in going green; they&#8217;re part of a large crop of startups and green technology innovations to emerge from UC research in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now is the perfect time for entrepreneurship in green technology,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>The newly released <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-s-climate-innovation-pays-california">2015 Technology Commercialization Report</a> from the University of California Office of the President shows that Carter isn&#8217;t alone in her thinking. Startups like Tule Technologies based on UC Davis technology are helping California growers adapt to limited water supplies, and clean energy startups from wave energy to next-generation battery manufacturers are emerging out of UC inventions at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Normally it takes a long time to move from idea stage to market,&#8221; said Carter, &#8220;but right now a combination of beneficial policy changes, natural disasters, and lifestyle changes are accelerating everything.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e9cdc4f48072701713dacb133f48bece"><name>travel-patterns-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biennial travel patterns survey</title><summary>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is launching its biennial survey to collect data on the travel patterns of our students, faculty, and staff.</summary><start-date>1463986800000</start-date><display-name>Biennial travel patterns survey</display-name><path>/2016/05/travel-patterns-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/travel-patterns-survey</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1464211455842</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464211455842</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is launching its biennial&#160;survey&#160;to collect data on the travel patterns of our students,&#160;faculty, and staff.

<p><strong>Sharon Daniel</strong> is a media artist who produces interactive and participatory documentaries focused on issues of social, economic, environmental and criminal justice.</p>
<p>As a Fulbright Scholar, she will be working with the Research Institute for Art and Design in the <a href="http://www.adbe.ulster.ac.uk">Faculty of Art, Design and Built Environment</a> at Ulster University to develop an interactive web documentary based on interviews with former paramilitaries and Restorative Justice practitioners in post-conflict Belfast.</p>
<p>Daniel's work has been exhibited internationally--most recently in a 2013 solo exhibition at STUK Kunstcentrum, Belgium. Her works have also been shown in museums and at festivals in Europe and the United States, and her essays have been published in numerous books and professional journals.</p>
<p>In 2009, Daniel was awarded the prestigious Rockefeller/Tribeca Film Festival New Media Fellowship. Her work has also been honored by the Webby Awards (the &#8220;Academy Awards of the Internet&#8221;). Daniel teaches classes at UC Santa Cruz in digital media theory and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Irene Lusztig</strong> is a filmmaker, media archeologist, and visual artist. Her film and video work mines old images and technologies for new meanings in order to reframe and revive forgotten and neglected histories.</p>
<p>Lusztig has received a Fulbright Scholar Award to work at the&#160;University of Lisbon (ULisboa), Institute of Social Sciences. She will be conducting initial archival research that&#160;will lay the groundwork for a new film project exploring colonial auto-ethnography, with an emphasis on Portuguese colonialist home movies filmed in Angola during the final years before Angolan independence in&#160;1975.</p>
<p>Born in England to Romanian parents, Lusztig grew up in Boston and has lived in France, Italy, Romania, China, and Russia. She received her BA in filmmaking and Chinese studies from Harvard and completed her MFA in film and video at Bard College.</p>
<p>Her work has been screened around the world in such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archive, IDFA Amsterdam, and on television in the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="edc967178072701713dacb13f4002f25"><name>planned-power-outages</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Power outages scheduled for June 15, 2-11 p.m.;  June 16, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</title><summary>The outages will not affect the total campus or any one location for the entire duration of the testing period.</summary><start-date>1464159600000</start-date><display-name>Planned Power Outages </display-name><path>/2016/05/planned-power-outages</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/planned-power-outages</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1464278278565</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1464652067930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Maintenance is to improve the stability of future power delivery</article-subhead><article-text><p>The purpose of this notice is to assist the community with preparedness.</p>
<p>Maintenance on the campus power distribution system will occur on June 15 and 16 in order to improve the stability of future power delivery to the campus.</p>
<p>The work will impact power delivered to the entire upper campus with expected multiple power outages of up to 40 minutes. While the scheduled maintenance and testing performed in March did not result in significant shutdown events, this June's planned maintenance will assuredly result in power outages. To be clear, however, the outages will vary by location, vary by duration, and vary by time of day. The outage will not affect the total campus or any one location for the total duration of the testing period.</p>
<p>The outages will NOT affect lower campus buildings such as Women's Center, Carriage House, Barn G, H Barn, Family Student Housing, Faculty Housing, Cook House, ERC, childcare facilities, or off-campus buildings. A complete list is&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/june-power-outages.pdf" target="_blank">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Please plan ahead: Charge cell phones before the outages, carry a flashlight, do not perform experiments or other work that rely on consistent power, etc. Work under the assumption that electrical power in the upper campus will be unavailable during the times noted.</p>
<p>Managers and supervisors have the responsibility for providing direction to employees, students, and volunteers, including operational decision making. In the event of a power outage, they are responsible for employee safety and for the implementation of all related business continuity actions. Managers are asked to prepare and address any questions that individuals under their supervision may have. Please read this detailed information closely and work to ensure readiness.</p>
<div><strong>Human resource information&#160;</strong></div>
<p>For employees who normally work on campus during these times, the workplace may be affected by power outages. To ensure employee safety and avoid a loss of pay due to the planned outage, managers and supervisors should consider the following:&#160;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A change in employee schedule</span>&#160;- An employee's work schedule may be adjusted to work around the power outage period;&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A change in employee work location</span>&#160;- An employee may be directed to work at an unaffected on-campus site or off-campus university-managed site, or to telecommute;&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scheduling an off-site training</span>&#160;- Managers may select to schedule a department training at an off-campus site;&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vacation or compensatory time off (CTO)</span>&#160;- Managers may approve advance requests for vacation or CTO in accordance with policy and labor agreements. Managers may not, however, curtail operations and require employees to use vacation or CTO;&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Administrative leave with pay</span>&#160;- Although not expected, if specific campus operations are officially determined to be inaccessible, the campus provost/executive vice chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who are expected to work but are unable. Managers will be notified should administrative leave with pay be approved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Facilities information&#160;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency power</span>&#160;- The standard emergency power supply for the campus, inclusive of emergency lighting, will be operable during the scheduled outage.&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lighting</span>&#160;- Managers should ensure that there is adequate lighting to support a safe workplace. If a workplace does not have enough light to work, please reassign the employee workspace. It's also best to ensure that employees and offices have flashlights on hand.&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elevators and accessibility</span>&#160;-&#160;<strong>Building coordinators, divisional facilities staff, building managers, or supervisors will need to post signage at all floors indicating they should not be used during the testing period.&#160;</strong>Please print the attached signage pdf and assign the posting to a specific person. Use of the elevators during this time could result in entrapment within the elevators requiring a fire department response. Anyone needing an elevator to access their place of work or general campus activity should consult with their supervisor for alternative accessibility options and work locations for the time of the outage.&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Housing and residential areas</span>&#160;- Although it is summer, there will be some students living throughout the residential areas. UCSC Dining operations will be closed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Partch was honored at an awards ceremony during the 2016 meeting of the society in May. She was recognized for her contributions to bringing structural biology and biophysics into the field of chronobiology. Chronobiology is the study of the biological clocks that drive the body's daily ("circadian") rhythms. Partch studies the workings of the biological clock at the molecular level.</p>
<p>This inaugural award, one of two given internationally, recognizes an outstanding pre-tenure faculty member for their independent contributions to the field of chronobiology. The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms is the premier research society in chronobiology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/biological-clock.html</url><title>Scientists discover a protein that silences the biological clock</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="07da0cdd8072701713dacb13e9a6be82"><name>commencement-2016</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Commencement 2016 is about to begin</title><summary>Continuing a tradition from last year, nine colleges and the graduate division have invited alumni to participate as keynote speakers as UC Santa Cruz holds commencement ceremonies Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, June 10-12.</summary><start-date>1464715800000</start-date><display-name>Commencement 2016</display-name><path>/2016/05/commencement-2016</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/commencement-2016</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1464715577211</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1465402702003</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/05/images/commencement-2016-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/05/images/commencement-2016-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>commencement-2016-500.jpg</name><display-name>commencement-2016-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>127975</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>commencement ceremonies</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/commencement-2015-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/commencement-2015-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>commencement-2015-80.jpg</name><display-name>commencement-2015-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>30029</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>commencement ceremonies</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>More than 4,700 UCSC students are earning undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2015-2016 academic year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Nine colleges and the graduate division feature alumni as keynote speakers</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz commencement ceremonies are scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, June 10-12, hosted by UCSC's 10 colleges, graduate division, and Baskin School of Engineering.</p>

 On Monday, May 30, at 2 p.m, the victim told UC Santa Cruz Police officers that an unknown suspect took the victim's cell phone and study papers from the College Nine/Ten Dining Room.&#160; When the victim gave chase, the suspect took a fighting stance and threatened to harm the victim.

<br/>
 The suspect is described as a white male, 19-20 years old, 5 feet, 10 inches to 6 feet tall, weighing between 165 and 180 pounds.&#160; The suspect had a slender build, was clean shaven with blond or light brown, short-cut hair, and was wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved T-shirt. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 The investigation is ongoing. Updates regarding this incident, when and if available, will be provided.<br/>

 <strong>Safety Tips</strong></p>
<p><br/>
 No action or inaction by a&#160;crime&#160;victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for&#160;crimes&#160;and their effects.<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Victims of&#160;crime&#160;and witnesses should report all&#160;crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, when it is safe to do so by calling 911.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;&#8232;<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.<br/>
 &#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Use the Night Safety Escort Program, Monday through Thursday evening from 8:30 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. by calling&#160;831-459-2231 ext. 1.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Perhaps you love browsing the hushed corridors of an art museum, or maybe you prefer pumping iron while staring down at the beautiful Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Maybe you like to while away your afternoons getting cozy with a friendly shark or staring up at some glowing planets through a powerful microscope.</p>
<p>Wherever your interests lie, UC Santa Cruz will inspire you and help you while away the long summertime days when most of the students have headed elsewhere. With smaller crowds, the campus will feel like yours alone.</p>
<p>Following are a few suggestions for ways to explore and enjoy UC Santa Cruz over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Tour the Quarry</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s beloved Quarry Amphitheater was once a prime gathering spot, concert venue, and activity space. Then it fell into disrepair and was closed off from public use starting in 2006.</p>
<p>But the Quarry Amphitheater is proving that campus landmarks can return to their old glory; currently the subject of an ambitious fundraising effort, and targeted for retrofitting and improvement, the Quarry will come back better than ever. This summer is your chance to find out why Slugs and other Santa Cruzans love this place so much and are excited for its return. <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3534">Forty-minute walking tours</a> are scheduled for the summer months. Tours depart at noon on June 16, July 21, August 18, September 15, and October 20.</p>
<p><strong>McHenry and Science and Engineering libraries</strong></p>
<p>In the summer months, the libraries of UC Santa Cruz are quiet and uncrowded.&#160;Both McHenry and the Science &amp; Engineering libraries are open to the public and are designed in a way that will make you feel like you&#8217;re dwelling among the nearby redwoods, which rise up over the many windows, even while you are catching up on your Great Books or&#160;reading the latest bestseller in a tranquil room.</p>
<p>In the summer session, <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/mchenry-library">McHenry Library</a> and the <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/science">Science &amp; Engineering Library</a> are open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The library will be closed on Saturdays and Sundays during the summer session. Please note the Grateful Dead Exhibit is open during regular library hours. The library will be closed on Independence Day.</p>
<p><strong>Art al fresco</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>If you want to enjoy art while sunbathing and taking in views of interesting exotic plants, UC Santa Cruz has a brilliant solution for you. <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3747">The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is displaying sculptures from area artists i</a>n a series of three temporary exhibits that opened to the public on June 1. The first exhibit in the series is a partnership with Susana Arias, one of the curators of Sierra Azul Nursery &amp; Garden&#8217;s delightful sculpture exhibits in Watsonville.</p>
<p>But if you prefer your art indoors, head over to the <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/current">Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery,</a> where the annual Irwin Scholarship Award exhibition showcases a collection of the most promising undergraduate artists at UC Santa Cruz. The William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund was established in 1986 and generates annual merit scholarships to further the education of selected UC Santa Cruz art students. The 2016 award recipients are Jairo Banuelos, Haley Belenis, Thomas Fallis, Andrea Furtado, Jesse Huynh, Jordan Krauss, Erick Medel, Sarah Ploenzke, Caetano Santos, Rachel Smith, Luigi Villanueva, and Chloe Yantis. The exhibit runs through June 11.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness center</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s gym can&#8217;t be beat in terms of its ridiculously beautiful setting, overlooking a meadow and a hillside that swoops down toward the ocean<strong>.</strong> If you are antsy and eager to burn off some calories, you will be glad to know the facility is open during the summer months with the exception of holidays. Just be warned: working out here will spoil you!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fitlife.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz FitLife</a> program is also available for non-students. By buying a facility usage membership card, or paying a day-use fee, community members have access to its recreation facilities, which include tennis, racquetball, and basketball courts; the wellness center; running track and playing fields; and a swimming pool. Enrollment is available online. Prices vary. For more information, call (831) 459-2531.</p>

<p><strong>Market cart</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the lookout for fresh veggies or wish to surprise a loved one with some home-grown floral displays, drive on up (or jump on your cruiser bike) to the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s market cart at the corner of Bay and High streets at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus.

<p><strong>Mysteries of the deep</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> is a brief drive away from the main campus, but it&#8217;s worth the trip. The center allows you to delve into the Monterey Bay without donning a wetsuit and getting kelp stuck in your hair. You can sign up for one of the daily behind-the-scenes tours or just browse the aquaria and exhibits.</p>
<p>The center is a popular UC Santa Cruz satellite where hard-working marine researchers are exploring the mysteries of the deep. The volunteers will be eager to assist you, whether your little one wants to find out what it is like to pet a sea star, or whether you want to figure out where the clever resident octopus is hiding out inside its tank. You can also gape at some real live shark eggs and find out about the people who are working to protect the bay.</p>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>And of course, no visit to the center would be complete without a selfie in front of &#8220;Ms. Blue,&#8221; a blue whale skeleton so gigantic, you will find it hard to believe your eyes. And if you happen to have a little one, they will not let you leave before they get a chance to pet a swell shark, a gentle creature that got its name because it can swell up with water.</p>
<p>If your child wishes to hold or pet one of these creatures, make sure to ask a volunteer for assistance at the swell shark tank.</p>

<p><strong>Lick Observatory</strong></p>
<p>If you would rather look up toward the heavens than gaze down at the ocean&#8217;s depths, head out to the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, a state-of-the-art research facility for astronomers.</p>
<p>The observatory is only 20 miles or so from downtown San Jose, but when you take the serpentine Mt. Hamilton Road, which climbs to an elevation of 4,200 feet, you&#8217;ll feel like you are worlds away.</p>
<p>The Gift Shop &amp; Visitor Center is open Thursday through Sunday from 12 noon-5 p.m.. year-round. Lick Observatory is also home to the ever-popular <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/">Music of the Spheres</a> series, but keep in mind that these events sell out very quickly. You can also take in a free talk inside the famous dome of the 36-inch Great Refractor every day at 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m., 3:30 p.m., and&#160;4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Guests are permitted to visit Lick Observatory at night by buying a ticket to the <a href="https://www.ucolick.org/main/visit/summer.html">Summer Series from June through September</a>. (But&#160;kindly refrain from visiting the observatory at night without a ticket to one of its scheduled evening programs.)</p>
<p>For more information on the observatory, contact the Lick Observatory Guides Office/Gift Shop at (408) 274-5061 or giftshop@ucolick.org.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7637c08f8072701713dacb13ce2ad7c0"><name>disturbing-email</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Disturbing email sent to members of campus community</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and Information Technology Services have received several reports about a disturbing email sent to some campus community members Thursday night. </summary><start-date>1470380400000</start-date><display-name>Disturbing email sent to members of campus community</display-name><path>/2016/05/disturbing-email</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/disturbing-email</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1470862179026</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1470862221906</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and Information Technology Services have received several reports about a disturbing email sent to some campus community members Thursday night. <br/>
 <br/>
 Neither the police department nor the university administration condone this sort of spam email. Though the email is unnerving and disturbing, it does not contain any specific threats. Staff members in Information Technology Services are looking into the matter.<br/>

<p>During his introduction of legendary social psychologist Elliot Aronson to an overflow crowd, Jim Temple (Ph.D. psychology, '85) reflected on the lifelong inspiration he received from his graduate adviser. Elliot, he said, lived his philosophy of tireless self-improvement, and embodied the integration of "being and becoming."</p>
<p>John Laird (B.A. politics, Stevenson, '72) described the time he was headed to the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami as a delegate for candidate George McGovern, and Chancellor Dean McHenry gently took him aside to ask if he had enough money to make the trip.</p>
<p>Drummond Pike (B.A. politics, Stevenson, 1970), this year's recipient of the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award, told the story of being chastened by an encounter with McHenry while riding his motorcycle on a pedestrian bridge. (To Drummond's credit, he said he took the experience to heart and didn't do it again.)</p>
<p>Those anecdotes, each shared with deep affection, speak to the caring community of UC Santa Cruz, and to the lasting impact of the student experience. They are good reminders for faculty, staff, and administrators that what we're doing today has impacts well beyond the four or five years our students are with us. Meaningful experiences take place both inside and outside the classroom, and they shape how alumni think of UC Santa Cruz for decades to come.</p>
<p>Recent graduates Pavit Singh (B.S., electrical engineering, College Eight, 2012) and Anastassia Tolpygo (B.S., applied physics, Kresge, 2010) reminisced about meeting during an introductory electrical engineering class, and chatted with senior staff about our international engagement efforts. By the end of the day, Pavit was ready to sign up with the <a href="http://careers.ucsc.edu/student/networking/career-advice-network.html?utm_source=05-06-2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=chancellor-newsletter">Career Advice Network</a>, saying an internship jumpstarted his own career and he'd be happy to network with current students.</p>
<p>Professor Emeritus of American Studies John Dizikes wrapped up a Friday night panel discussion about teaching and learning by sharing his motto, "Good students make good teachers," which I think is a fitting tribute to Banana Slugs&#8212;and their professors.</p>
<p>Walking around campus, I'm grateful for all the alumni whose support has made so many projects possible, including the renovation of the Hay Barn, securing the future of the Cowell Press, and inspiring the restoration of the Quarry Amphitheater. Some of today's students aren't waiting until they graduate to help the campus: Students in Cowell Provost Faye Crosby's philanthropy class hosted a fundraising dinner Saturday night that raised more than $30,000 for the Quarry project.</p>
<p>As I strolled through the poster displays during the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/graduate-research.html?utm_source=05-06-2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=chancellor-newsletter">Graduate Research Symposium</a> at McHenry Library on Friday, hearing dozens of students eagerly explaining their work, I wondered what stories they'll tell in a few years when they come back to campus for Alumni Weekend.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>The Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="828c38a4807270177653ce7856065aa8"><name>ken-corday-funds-arts-division-endowment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumnus Ken Corday Funds Arts Division Endowment in Television and Film Writing</title><summary>Ken Corday (Porter 1977) and the Corday Foundation have made a substantial financial contribution to the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division to establish the Kenneth R.

Corday Family Presidential Chair Endowment in Writing for Television &amp; Film</strong>. The gift will significantly strengthen the Film and Digital Media Department&#8217;s screenwriting program and enable our students to learn directly from guest lecturers and experts in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the forever game changer for our students interested in writing for film and television,&#8221; said David Yager, Dean of the Arts Division. &#8220;The wonderful thing about an endowment is that it establishes an opportunity for our students in perpetuity that otherwise would not be possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corday, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BA in Aesthetic Studies-Music, is the music composer and executive producer of the extremely successful daytime show&#160;<em>Days of Our Lives</em>, which, like UC Santa Cruz, is celebrating its 50th&#160;anniversary this year. He has been nominated for 16 Daytime Emmys and won the Daytime Emmy Award for Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series in 1990 and 1997. He also won the 2007 Film &amp; TV Music Award for Best Score for a Television Daytime Drama for his work on the series.&#160;<em>Days of Our Lives</em>&#160;has won numerous Emmys over the years and was awarded the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series in 2013 and 2015. The show is one of the longest running scripted series in the world.</p>
<p>"Strong and compelling storytelling is the foundation to the success of any television production,&#8221; said Corday. &#8220;As a proud UCSC alumnus, it is my honor to create this opportunity for the next generation of aspiring television writers."</p>
<p>Corday credits music lecturer in jazz and composition,&#160;<strong>Randy Masters</strong>,&#160;with being a major influence on his life and career. He is thrilled to be able to support his alma mater, and especially with an endowment in writing since he believes that the success of any television or film is due to having outstanding writers who can create exceptional scripts. Corday also has just completed his first novel,&#160;<em>Ladies of the Lake</em>, an intriguing murder mystery set in a wealthy community filled with disgruntled wives. His other book,&#160;<em>The True Story of One Family&#8217;s Dream and the Untold Story of Days of Our Lives</em>, is about his notable family legacy.</p>
<p>Corday is CEO of Corday Productions which was founded in 1965 by his parents, Ted and Betty Corday, who originally created&#160;<em>Days of Our Lives</em>. In addition, the production company is part of All Screens Media, an international, interactive digital media company, and the TruLOVE online network.</p>
<p>In 2004, Corday and his wife Sherry established the Corday Foundation, whose philanthropic goodwill supports numerous causes including Children&#8217;s Hospital of Los Angeles, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is incredibly generous to have someone think about us, the Arts at UC Santa Cruz, and truly understand how important this gift is for our students and their education,&#8221; said Dean Yager.&#160; &#8220;We are extremely grateful for and excited about how this will change our program.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d2a207ae8072701764c820a673e6272c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2016/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/05/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1459527747478</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1477419664856</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
