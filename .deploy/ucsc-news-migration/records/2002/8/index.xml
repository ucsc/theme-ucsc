Harris-Barnett's appointment begins September 1. She replaces Eileen Tanner, the center's founding director, who left the post in June. </p><p>The mission of CTE, which was established in 1991, is to enhance the overall quality of instruction at UCSC and to improve students' long-term learning by supporting faculty and graduate students as instructors. </p><p>"Ruth is an excellent person to take over CTE during a time of transition," said Goff. "In addition to having taught university-level courses, she has also worked in the corporate world in both management and customer-relations positions, and she has a particular interest in writing courses. I am very pleased to welcome Ruth to Santa Cruz."</p><p>Harris-Barnett earned her B.A. in 1980, an M.A. in 1985, and her Ph.D. in English from the University of Washington. She has also taught at both the University of Washington and Western Washington University, and she has worked with a variety of community service organizations in the Seattle area.</p><p>CTE sponsors the annual Excellence in Teaching Awards that recognize the most exceptional teachers among the faculty, and an annual Convocation on Teaching that provides a public forum for UCSC faculty to discuss current topics in higher education. CTE also provides instructional improvement grants that fund projects to enhance instruction in undergraduate courses and publishes Faculty Focus, a quarterly newsletter about teaching and learning featuring writing by members of the UCSC community.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c31c78072704601a012ff9a10f616"><name>184</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Virtual High School' leaders to meet at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312, ldonahue@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Virtual High School, Hernandez</keywords><start-date>1029135600000</start-date><display-name>'Virtual High School' leaders...</display-name><path>/2002/08/184</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/08/184</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337943952</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337943952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Leaders of "virtual high schools" in more than 25 states are gathering at UC Santa Cruz from August 15 to 17 to discuss common issues and consider forming a national organization.</p><p>Representatives of pioneers in the field, including the Florida Virtual School, Illinois Virtual High School, Michigan Virtual High School, and Kentucky Virtual High School, will be among those meeting at the UCSC Inn to talk about such issues as student assessment, online curricula, and research collaborations. </p><p>Virtual classes are available online, and generally offer specialized courses not available at a student's own school.

Overall, the campus received $13.1 million in private support.</p>
<p>"This generous support for research and teaching at UCSC is particularly impressive in a time of economic uncertainty," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "It recognizes our commitment to increase understanding of our environment, and promotes the enhancement of our library collections and of graduate education, among many other important priorities."</p>
<p>UCSC received significant support from local donors.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz businessman Ramesh Bhojwani established the Bhojwani Family Endowed Graduate Fellowship to help financially needy students who are the first in their families to attend graduate school. In addition to his $200,000 award for the fellowship, Bhojwani contributed $100,000 toward construction of the new University Center at UCSC. In consideration of the gift, Ramesh Bhojwani has requested that the University Center dining room be named for his father, Hemandas Doulatram Bhojwani.</p>
<p>Another key campus initiative benefited from local generosity. The estate of longtime library supporter Dorothy Emigh provided $128,483, the first major donation to the McHenry Library Expansion Campaign. Planned library enhancements include an interactive computer center where librarians work in partnership with students and a digitization and preservation laboratory for Special Collections.</p>
<p>UCSC's environmental research also drew considerable support, including $1 million from the W. M. Keck Foundation of Los Angeles for ongoing research on the environmental toxicology of trace metals. The grant will enable the campus to purchase state-of-the-art equipment for conducting trace metal research, an area in which UCSC has been a world leader for many years.</p>
<p>New instrumentation obtained with the grant will enable UCSC researchers to continue to make major advances in understanding the global cycling of trace metals throughout the environment and their effects on biological systems. Trace metals include toxic elements such as lead and mercury, as well as biologically essential elements that can be toxic at high concentrations.</p>
<p>"This award builds on the strengths of the UCSC campus for interdisciplinary research on trace metals in the environment," said Russell Flegal, professor and chair of environmental toxicology, who will coordinate the award.</p>
<p>Integrating science, technology, engineering, policy, and society ("STEPS") to solve environmental problems was the goal of a $500,000 gift from alumnus Gordon Ringold and his wife, Tanya Zarucki. Their donation helped launch the new STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research.</p>
<p>The institute will focus on the three global environmental changes caused by human activities over the past century: climate change enhanced by our expanding industrial societies; the genetic restructuring of all ecosystems caused by the global transport of species and changing global environments; and transformation of all the Earth's major water systems through alteration of rivers and lakes, increased use of oceanic resources, and diffusion of environmental toxins.</p>
<p>"The STEPS Institute is one that I feel really builds on the tremendous diversity and strength in the environmental sciences that UCSC has already established," said Ringold.</p>
<p>Medical research at UCSC garnered private funding as well, with environmental toxicologist Karen Ottemann receiving a grant from the Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholars Program in Global Infectious Disease. The grant, providing $50,000 per year for four years, supports Ottemann's research into a common bacterium that can cause stomach inflammation and ulcers and increases the risk of stomach cancer.</p>
<p>Individual donors provide crucial support to the campus each year. In the last fiscal year, such gifts to the Annual Fund, including gifts from UCSC Alumni Association councilors, other alumni, UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees, parents, and friends, totaled over $1.3 million. This includes $93,493 for the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports UCSC through its private fundraising efforts, gave over $1.1 million to the campus this past year.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to the many individuals and organizations that have provided crucial support for UCSC," said Ronald P. Suduiko, UCSC's vice chancellor for University Relations. "Although we are a public institution, only about 40 percent of campus funds are provided by the state of California. We rely upon private philanthropy to ensure a top-quality learning environment for our students and support for our academic initiatives."</p>
<p>The bulk of the private contributions to UCSC during the 2002 fiscal year came from the following sources: foundations, $4.7 million; individuals, $4.6 million; and the business sector, $1.9 million. Other sources, including community and campus organizations, gave a total of $1.9 million.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c346b8072704601a012ff3ef41ab5"><name>186</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Relationship of labor organization and dance explored in new book</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>dance, labor, Franko, Work of Dance</keywords><start-date>1030431600000</start-date><display-name>Relationship of labor organization...</display-name><path>/2002/08/186</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/08/186</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337944618</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337944618</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Consider this recent New York Times headline: "Radio City and the Rockettes Reach Labor Agreement." While the juxtaposition of high kicks and labor actions might appear odd, a new book by Mark Franko, professor of theater arts at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows the relationship has roots going back 70 years.</p><p>In The Work of Dance, Franko argues that dance and labor were profoundly interrelated in 1930s America, when the economy was stalled by depression, political emotions ran strong, and the Federal Dance and Theater Projects brought more and more Americans to dance both as performers and audience members. Workers began to take on dance as their expressive idiom.</p><p>"The 1930s was a period of ideological strife, and the dance world was also divided up," said Franko. "The way that dance genres and choreographic forms were being developed at that time had everything to do with the ideological concepts of groups of people."</p><p>The Work of Dance extends the study of dance beyond the "high art" of ballet to include the genres of chorus dancing and modern dance. Franko's research shows the development of modern dance in the 1930s went hand-in-hand with the development of a collective, and also individually oriented, expression of emotion. This expression paralleled some of the feeling behind contemporary political movements, particularly American communism.</p><p>"A close analysis of dances in terms of the emotional expression," said Franko, "allows us to get a more historically scrupulous analysis of the political intent behind the dances."</p><p>Franko also found relationships between the development of choreographic structures--organizing people in dance performances--and the administrative structures of politics--organizing people in social acts. "If you could get people to do dance performances, they could also do social acts. And the courage to strike did not differ greatly from the 'guts' required to dance in front of an audience," said Franko.</p><p>A dancer and choreographer himself, Franko cites a memory which inspired his research for The Work of Dance. As a teenager studying dance, he took classes at a studio on the second floor of a building in New York City's garment district. The room had one wall of windows overlooking the street. </p><p>"Sweating through my dance class I was keenly aware that dance was indeed hard work and took tremendous labor," said Franko. "And every time I was in class at 5:00, I'd see all these workers, en masse, flooding out onto the street after finishing their day's work. It made a connection in my mind, the connection between dance and work."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c35b98072704601a012ff0d8c768c"><name>187</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>African liberation movement posters exhibited at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Anthony, poster, african liberation</keywords><start-date>1030518000000</start-date><display-name>African liberation movement posters...</display-name><path>/2002/08/187</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/08/187</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337944968</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337944968</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The exhibition could be summed up by one featured image: a larger-than-life-sized portrait of a young Nelson Mandela, on a blazing yellow background, under the headline "The struggle is my life."</p><p>"A Luta Continúa: African Liberation Movement Posters," the current exhibition at the McHenry Library of the University of California, Santa Cruz, uses period posters and music to document the struggles of African nations in achieving independence. The exhibition, which is open to the public and runs through September 30, also includes related pamphlets, flyers, and books from the library collections.</p><p>The phrase "A Luta Continúa" means "The Struggle Continues" in Portuguese. It was an expression commonly chanted at political gatherings, initially in Portuguese-speaking Africa, but later spreading to other African nations and used internationally by liberation-support communities. </p><p>Posters on loan from the collection of David H. Anthony III, associate professor of history at UC Santa Cruz, form the core of the "A Luta Continúa." Anthony began his collection while a graduate student in the late 1970s, and continued adding pieces during periods of travel and residence in Africa, Europe, and America. He has also provided extensive exhibition notes and captions. </p><p>"These posters can been seen as nostalgic and as glorifying violence," said Anthony. "But in the context of the African liberation movement, they are reminders that armed struggle was a last resort, turned to only after years of fruitless efforts at negotiation." </p><p>The exhibition includes imagery from liberation movements in Mozambique, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. One of the highlights is a rare poster from the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, a group maintaining a small but strong following in South Africa. There is also a vibrantly colored poster announcing a fundraiser for Radio Freedom, the underground voice of the African National Congress, which began broadcasting in 1967. </p><p>The musical portion of "A Luta Continúa," set up on a listening station at the exhibition, was inspired by Radio Freedom's format. Beginning with the sign on for Radio Freedom, the recording includes a 1977 interview with South African activist Steve Biko; an audio documentary on songs of liberation; and freedom songs from South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.</p><p>"The struggles represented in this exhibition are not ancient history," said Anthony, noting recent violence over land reform in Zimbabwe. "This exhibition is about history in our lifetimes.

Skinner, who topped the list, Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, and Albert Bandura.	</p><p>	With typical self-deprecating humor, Aronson commented, "I only got ranked 78th, but then again, I am among the 22 who are still alive--so I'm grateful for that!"</p><p>	One of the most distinguished social psychologists of our time, Aronson made major contributions to the field of human behavior, exploring the theory of cognitive dissonance and the causes of interpersonal attraction. His research always addressed important social problems, including prejudice reduction, energy conservation, and AIDS prevention. </p><p>	The study, reported in the July/August issue, Vol. 6, No. 2, ranked 99 of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, based on the frequency of three variables: journal citation, introductory psychology textbook citation, and survey response. Surveys were sent to 1,725 members of the American Psychological Society, asking them to list the top psychologists of the century. In their ranking, researchers also took into account whether the psychologists were members of the National Academy of Sciences, had been elected president of the American Psychological Association (APA) or received the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and whether their surname was used as an eponym.</p><p>	Cathaleene Macias, a mental health researcher at McLean Hospital at Harvard University and a former student of Aronson's, credits Aronson with moving psychology "into a new dimension that blends the best of analytical thinking and research rigor with the practical thinking of everyday life."</p><p>	Aronson applied theory to real-world problems and presented his work in language that was accessible to the public. He challenged psychologists and other social scientists to adopt research designs that allowed theory to be adapted to the specifics of everyday life, she said.</p><p>	"He taught the rest of us that there is nothing so practical as a theory that's been honed by research and examined by the heart," said Macias.</p><p>	Aronson joined the UCSC faculty in 1974. He began teaching at Harvard University in 1959 and moved in 1962 to the University of Minnesota. He joined the University of Texas in 1965. His textbook, The Social Animal, remains among the most popular texts in social psychology. Since retiring from UCSC in 1994, Aronson has been affiliated with Stanford University.</p><p>	The complete list of the top psychologists of the 20th century is reprinted below. Continuing a tradition begun by researcher Eugene Garfield, who compiled a Top 100 list in 1977 and left the No. 100 spot open, researchers deliberately left No. 100 unnamed to leave room for an accomplished individual. </p><p></p><p>1.
