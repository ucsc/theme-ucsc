But a study in the January 3 issue of the journal Nature reveals that white sharks can range hundreds of miles across the open ocean. In fact, one male tagged along the Central California coast migrated thousands of miles to the warm waters of Hawaii and remained there for nearly four months.</p><p>The Nature study involved six marine scientists from three California institutions: Burney Le Boeuf and Scott Davis of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Peter Pyle and Scot Anderson of the Point Reyes Bird Observatory (PRBO) in Stinson Beach, Calif.; and Barbara Block and Andre Boustany of the Tuna Research and Conservation Center, a joint project of Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p><p>Le Boeuf, a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, said he was shocked by the results.</p><p>"Going into this, what we expected was that white sharks were just coastal animals that breed in Southern California, then migrate a few hundred miles north to feed on seals," Le Boeuf said. "But it turns out they've got a life at sea, and when they're in the open ocean, they're diving very deep at times."</p><p>To monitor long-distance migrations, researchers attached "pop-up" satellite tags to the backs of six adult white sharks near seal rookeries in California between 1999 and 2000. Every two minutes, the tags recorded data on the sharks' location, the depth of their dives, and the temperature of the surrounding waters. Each tag was programmed to detach from the animal on a specific date, then pop up to the surface, where the data were transmitted via the Argos satellite system to computers at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station.</p><p>"Until this study, white sharks had only been tracked for a few days around seal colonies," said Stanford's Barbara Block. "With the advent of new electronic tagging technology, we can now track their movement, depth, and temperature preferences over many weeks and months," she said.</p><p>A legendary hunter, the white shark is the world's largest predatory fish, reaching 21 feet (7 meters) in length and weighing up to 4,800 pounds (2,100 kilograms). The six animals tagged during the Nature study--four males and two females--ranged in size from 11 to 15 feet (3.7 to 5 meters). All six were tagged in the fall--three near Southeast Farallon Island about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of San Francisco, and three near Año Nuevo Island about 55 miles (88 kilometers) to the south. Sharks are attracted to these islands by the large number of elephant seals that congregate there.</p><p>Researchers used different techniques to tag the sharks. At the Farallon site, PRBO researchers Peter Pyle and Scot Anderson, with assistance from Stanford graduate student Andre Boustany and UCSC graduate student Scott Davis, stood watch on the island until they spotted a shark preying on a seal.</p><p>"These feeding events can last a half-hour or more," said Pyle. "When we see one, we jump in the boat and carefully approach the area where the sharks are feeding. We tag them as they swim around the boat."</p><p>At the Año Nuevo site, Davis placed a decoy in the water--a plywood cutout of a seal. Sharks approached the decoy, sometimes mouthing it, and when a shark surfaced near the boat Davis would apply a tag to its back. </p><p>Satellite tagging data confirmed that, in the fall, white sharks appear near these coastal seal rookeries just as young elephant seals arrive to rest prior to the annual mating ritual of the adult seals. Data showed that, while near shore, tagged sharks spent most of their time close to the surface, usually diving no more than 90 feet (30 meters) down and swimming in temperate waters ranging between 50 degrees F and 57.2 F (10 C and 14 C).</p><p>The surprise came in winter when four sharks tracked for longer durations all headed offshore into the central and eastern Pacific. One male--named Tipfin by PRBO researchers--migrated from the Farallones to the Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe some 2,280 miles (3,800 kilometers) to the west, traveling at a minimum velocity of 43 miles (71 kilometers) per day. The animal stayed in Hawaiian waters the entire winter and spring.</p><p>"White sharks have only rarely been reported in recent times in Hawaii," Block said. "But ancient cultures had tools that were made from white shark teeth, so it's clear they have been around the islands for some time." </p><p>Three other tagged sharks--two females and a male--migrated to a subtropical region of the eastern Pacific hundreds of miles west of Baja California. The three sharks remained in the open ocean for several months, never venturing near any coastline. </p><p>"What they were doing out there is a mystery," Le Boeuf said. "Since they were hunting for seals when tagged, such a long migration suggests a possible rendezvous for mating, or a move to feed on different prey. "</p><p>Another possibility, he added, is that the sharks were migrating on the same track to Hawaii as Tipfin, but the electronic data record ended before they reached their destination.</p><p>Pop-up satellite tags also revealed interesting diving patterns of the four sharks during their transits across the open sea. While they sometimes dove as deep as 2,040 feet (680 meters) below sea level, the animals seemed to prefer swimming at two discrete depths--one within 15 feet (5 meters) of the surface, the other 900 to 1,500 feet (300 to 500 meters) down. All four sharks spent up to 90 percent of the day in these two diving zones and little time at intermediate depths, according to the Nature study.</p><p>White sharks are endothermic or warmblooded fish, like tunas, capable of maintaining large temperature differences between their bodies and the surrounding water. The new study shows that they can tolerate a broad range of water temperatures.</p><p>"As the sharks moved offshore to the southwest, they increased their diving activity and experienced a broader range of ambient temperatures," the authors wrote. The sharks encountered temperatures ranging from 79 F (26 C) at the surface to 41 F (4.8 C) at their maximum diving depth some 2,000 feet (667 meters) below the surface.</p><p>Satellite data indicate that sharks spend at least five months in the open ocean, "suggesting that it could be an important period in the life history of white sharks in the North Pacific," the study's authors concluded.</p><p>"Increased surveillance using electronic tagging should provide more information about the movement patterns," they wrote.</p><p>The research team is currently spearheading new shark studies at Año Nuevo and the Farallones islands. In November, Tipfin returned to the Farallones, giving Pyle, Anderson, and Boustany the opportunity to attach another pop-up tag on his back. The tag was programmed to record data for nine months and could answer some of the questions about the shark's round-trip migration.</p><p>"We see the same sharks return to the Farallones again and again," said Pyle. "Males come back yearly, but females return every other year, which means they may be going farther afield than males as part of a two-year breeding cycle. So long-range data on females will be of particular interest." </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Le Boeuf at (831) 459-2845 or leboeuf@cats.ucsc.edu, and Block at (831) 655-6236 or bbl</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b85de8072704601a012ffc041fbc6"><name>34</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC education prof shares prize from Modern Language Association</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1010127600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC education prof shares...</display-name><path>/2002/01/34</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/34</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337899937</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337899937</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Gordon Wells, a professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named corecipient of the 21st annual Kenneth W. Mildenberger Prize awarded by the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America.</p><p>Wells and Hossein Nassaji of Centennial College in Toronto, Canada, shared the prize for their article, "What's the Use of Triadic Dialogue?: An Investigation of Teacher-Student Interaction," which appeared in the journal Applied Linguistics in 2000.</p><p>The article offers an in-depth discussion of the value of "triadic dialogue," a term that refers to a three-part pattern classroom interaction in which a teacher asks a student a question, the student replies, and the teacher offers a follow-up response. In the paper, Wells and Nassaji argue against the wholesale rejection of this form of interaction, which Wells noted "can be used in many ways, some of them good and some of them bad." The discussion is followed by an analysis of 44 actual classroom lessons that show the different ways in which triadic dialogue was used by a group of accomplished teachers. The paper includes transcripts of verbatim interactions.</p><p>"Triadic dialogue can be used to invite the student to explain or elaborate, which extends the interaction," said Wells. These extended interactions are more like conversations than quizzes and can be valuable motivators for students, he said.</p><p>"Students become engaged and interested and learn because they are interested rather than just to get past the test," said Wells, who conducts research collaboratively with teachers to discover how an "inquiry approach" to the curriculum changes and enriches the nature of classroom interactions.</p><p>Wells joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2000. Prior to coming to UCSC, Wells was a professor at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and, until 1984, was the director of the longitudinal study of language development, "Language at Home and</p><p>at School", at the University of Bristol, England. </p><p>The Mildenberger Prize was established in 1979 and is awarded annually for an outstanding research publication in the field of teaching foreign languages and literatures. Wells and Nassaji each received a cash award of $250, a certificate, and a year's membership in the MLA. The prize was presented December 28 during the association's annual convention, which was held in New Orleans.</p><p>The selection committee's citation for the winning article lauded Wells and Nassaji for offering "a much more thoughtful and meaningful way of dealing with instruction and learning." </p><p>Established in 1883, the MLA is the largest American learned society in the humanities, with more than 30,000 members.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b87328072704601a012ffefa1b993"><name>35</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mystified by fruit trees?

Computer simulations now show, however, that Earth-sized planets are unlikely to form in the so-called "habitable zone" of 47 Ursae Majoris (47 UMa). </p><p>The new findings are being reported at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington, D.C., by Gregory Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz; John Chambers of NASA Ames Research Center; and Debra Fischer of UC Berkeley. </p><p>Planet hunters have detected nearly 80 planets orbiting nearby stars, but most of them have elongated, or "eccentric," orbits. The two planets around 47 UMa, which is located in the Big Dipper constellation, have nearly circular orbits, like those of Earth and other planets in our solar system. Their orbits are farther from the star than Mars is from the Sun, but closer than Jupiter. </p><p>The striking similarity between the pair of planets orbiting 47 UMa and the Jupiter-Saturn pair in our solar system led Laughlin, Chambers, and Fischer to investigate whether smaller, Earth-sized planets could have formed and survived in the habitable zone around 47 UMa. The habitable zone is the region surrounding a star where liquid water could exist on the surface of a planet--a region roughly equivalent to the space between the orbits of Venus and Mars in the solar system. Earth-like (or "terrestrial") planets are too small to be detected with present-day planet hunting techniques. </p><p>The researchers performed a large set of computer simulations and found that Earth-sized planets have a very hard time forming in 47 UMa's habitable zone. The combined gravitational forces of the two large outer planets conspire to prevent Earth-sized planets from building up in orbits where temperatures are clement, Laughlin said. </p><p>"Our simulations suggest that terrestrial planets can readily form around 47 UMa in orbits that are roughly half the size of Earth's orbit," he said. "Out in the habitable zone, an Earth-sized planet can survive in a stable orbit, but it is very hard to see how such a planet could be assembled." </p><p>During the formation of a planetary system, terrestrial planets such as Earth or Mars are believed to form from successive collisions of small asteroid-sized bodies which stick together to form progressively larger bodies called "planetary embryos." This process is known as planetary accretion. It is likely that our solar system went through a such a phase, in which hundreds of moon-sized planetary embryos emerged from numerous collisions among a much larger number of small precursor bodies, Laughlin said. </p><p>The researchers used a highly efficient computer program developed by Chambers to simulate the further development of planetary accretion from this stage. A typical calculation followed the long-term evolution of a swarm of 280 moon-sized planetary embryos in the presence of the two giant planets orbiting 47 UMa, and spanned a time frame of 50 million years near the beginning of 47 UMa's history. The simulations showed that embryos starting in the habitable zone tend to jostle each other into orbits where the gravitational tugs from the two outer planets either fling the embryos from the system or drive them into the star itself. On the other hand, the embryos that started inside the habitable zone were always able to consolidate into several Earth-sized planets, all having an orbital period of half a year or less. </p><p>At the end of several simulations, a single tiny survivor was left in the habitable zone. In other simulations, the habitable zone was entirely cleared, Chambers said. </p><p>The survival of isolated remnant embryos in the habitable zone of 47 UMa suggests a possible parallel to the asteroid belt in our own solar system. Within the asteroid belt, many orbits are stable, but certain locations within the belt contain unstable "resonances" where objects experience rapid orbital instability. Planetary embryos tend to scatter each other into these unstable zones, leaving behind a smattering of survivors--the asteroids--which are much smaller than the terrestrial planets. </p><p>"Because these two giant planets orbiting 47 UMa are more than twice as close to the star as Jupiter and Saturn are to the Sun, the 47 UMa system looks like an overweight, scaled-down version of the solar system. Any terrestrial planets or an analogue to the asteroid belt around 47 UMa would likely be about twice as close to the star as well," Chambers said. </p><p>The researchers' assessment of habitable planet formation was part of a larger theoretical investigation of the two planets orbiting 47 UMa, in which the team narrowed the range of possible orbital configurations that the planets might occupy. They also showed that the two outer planets have undergone very little orbital modification since their formation. The research was funded by the NASA Origins of Solar Systems Program. </p><p></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Laughlin at (831) 459-3208 or laughlin@ucolick.org; Chambers at (650) 604-5514 or john@mycenai.arc.nasa.gov; and Fischer at (510) 643-8973 or fischer@serpens.berkeley.edu. </p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at  <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b8a678072704601a012ff47608f93"><name>37</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oral history published of HerBooks founder Irene Reti</title><author>Louise Donahue (831/459-5312)</author><start-date>1010386800000</start-date><display-name>Oral history published of...</display-name><path>/2002/01/37</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/37</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337901108</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337901108</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University Library's Regional History Project announces the publication of Irene Reti and HerBooks Feminist Press, the last in a trio of oral histories documenting archives on deposit in Special Collections, which are a part of the UC/Stanford Women's Studies Consortium California Feminist Presses Project.

His research currently focuses on how earthquakes and faults interact through the transfer of stress. Examples of such interactions include aftershock sequences, seismic quiescence, earthquake clusters, and the propagation of mainshocks along a fault. Stein and his collaborators are interested in how one earthquake can promote subsequent shocks at some sites and inhibit seismic activity at other sites. </p><p>"This work is driven by an attempt to deepen our understanding of the physics of earthquakes, and to develop a new way to assess earthquake hazards," Stein said. </p><p>The lecture is sponsored by UCSC's Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth.

From January through March, the center presents "Marvelous Marine Mammals," a series of events focused on Monterey Bay's sea lions, sea otters, dolphins, whales, and elephant seals, and the scientists who study them. Events include three science lectures, a whale-watching trip, and ongoing activities and presentations inside the exhibit hall at the Seymour Center, which is located at the end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz.</p><p>Lecture Series</p><p>Thursday, January 31: Tom Kieckhefer, president of the Pacific Cetacean Group, will speak on "Whales and Dolphins of Monterey Bay." Kieckhefer's talk will highlight local whales and dolphins, particularly humpbacks, and will also review the work of the Pacific Cetacean Group. </p><p>Thursday, February 21: Daniel Costa, UCSC professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will discuss "The At-Sea Biology of the Northern Elephant Seal." Considered "extreme animal athletes," elephant seals can dive for two hours at a time to depths of more than 5,000 feet. </p><p>Thursday, March 7: UCSC graduate student Laura Yeates will present "Warm and Fuzzy? How Sea Otters Manage in a Cold Ocean." Sea otters are the only marine mammals to rely solely on fur insulation rather than blubber to stay warm. Yeates has been working with otters at Long Marine Lab to study how they can survive frigid ocean temperatures.</p><p>All lectures will be held from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Seymour Center. Tickets are $5 for the general public and $4 for members. Tickets and information are available from the Seymour Center at (831) 459-3800.</p><p>Whale-Watching Trip</p><p>View migrating gray whales, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and orcas up close from the decks of the Star of Monterey. Educator Christy Walker will lead the annual whale-watching trip on Sunday, February 3, 8:30-11 a.m., at Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey. Cost is $30 for the general public, $25 for members, and $20 for children 16 and under. Reservations are required, as space is limited; call (831) 459-3800. </p><p>Other Events</p><p>All winter, visitors to the Seymour Center can help track the migration of gray whales from Baja to Alaska or participate in one of the center's four "See More" Labs. Dress up like Rocky the California sea lion and find out what she's teaching scientists about sea lion vision and hearing; discover how the athletic abilities of human scuba divers compare to those of dolphins; play marine mammal Jeopardy; or explore "Otter Fodder," the surprising diets of sea otters. </p><p>The Marine Mammal Research Tour offers visitors a behind-the-scenes look at marine mammal research at Long Marine Lab. Experience the world of marine mammal researchers and learn how they study dolphins, sea lions, elephant seals, harbor seals, and blue whales. The tour is offered on the second Thursday and fourth Sunday of each month beginning at 2:15 p.m. For advance registration, call (831) 459-3799.</p><p>During spring break, March 23 to April 7, a variety of special marine mammal demonstrations, tours, and arts-and-crafts projects will be featured daily. The center will be closed Easter Sunday. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: For additional information, reporters may contact Lisa Borok, visitor programs manager at the Seymour Center, at (831) 459-5548 or laborok@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b8f118072704601a012ff8343e8cd"><name>40</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC cancer survivor will carry the Olympic torch January 18</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1010646000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC cancer survivor will...</display-name><path>/2002/01/40</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/40</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337902298</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337902298</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Elizabeth Conerly was a broke UC Berkeley student as Mother's Day approached last year, but being penniless inspired her to give the best gift ever: Conerly nominated her mother, Trish Virgadamo, a longtime UCSC employee, to carry the Olympic torch on a segment of its cross-country journey to Salt Lake City.</p><p>The nomination, and the news that she was selected from more than 200,000 nominees, still stuns Virgadamo, who will carry the torch along a portion of West Cliff Drive on Friday, January 18. </p><p>"It was the greatest Mother's Day gift in the world," said Virgadamo, a UCSC benefits representative. "This is the biggest thrill and honor of my life."</p><p>It wasn't that long ago that Virgadamo and her family weren't sure she would ever run again. Virgadamo, who began running with Conerly, 22, and her sister Melissa, 24, when the girls were on the Santa Cruz High School track team, was sidelined in 1994-95 by Hodgkins lymphoma. Virgadamo was off work for 11 months, and though she beat the cancer, her lungs were scarred by the radiation treatment and she hasn't run since. In her nomination letter, Conerly, who graduated last month, cited her mother's courage and determination during the illness.</p><p>"She is so positive," Conerly said of her mother. "Even when she was sick, she stood up and fought it and didn't let it get her down. Through all of it, she was there for my sister and me, getting even more involved in our lives. It was just beyond belief."</p><p>Virgadamo's determination is evident in her desire to run her .2-mile segment of the relay Friday morning. "I used to walk along West Cliff every lunch hour before I got sick, and I ran several races there," said Virgadamo, whose family and friends will line the route to cheer her on.</p><p>Virgadamo is one of 66 local torchbearers participating in the Monterey/Seaside portion of the relay. Two days earlier, on January 16, UCSC freshman Paul Stanfield will carry the Olympic flame in San Luis Obispo.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Virgadamo will carry the torch on West Cliff Drive between David and Columbia streets.

<p>If the annual ritual of pruning fruit trees fills you with dread, relieve your anxiety by attending a pruning workshop with fruit-tree expert Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Martin will offer a pruning workshop for pome fruit trees (apples and pears) on Saturday, January 26. The pruning of stone fruit trees (peaches and plums) will be the subject on Saturday, February 2. Both workshops will take place from 10 a.m. to noon in the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the UCSC Farm. Wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels. The fee for each workshop, which is payable the day of the event, is $10; $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. No preregistration needed. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.</p>
<p>Proper pruning maximizes the productivity of fruit trees, enhances their beauty, and increases disease resistance. Martin will present the basic principles of pruning and will offer demonstrations if weather permits.</p>
<p>Also on Saturday, February 2, a new two-hour class for children ages 7-11 will focus on "Birds in the Garden." Youngsters will watch and learn about birds and will build simple bird feeders in this special class offered in the new Life Lab Garden Classroom at the UCSC Farm. The class will take place 10 a.m. to noon, and the fee is $5 per child. For more information, call (831) 459-2001.</p>
<p>The Louise Cain Gatehouse and the Life Lab Garden Classroom are located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.</p>
<p>Public workshops are sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which supports the activities of the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and promotes organic gardening and farming.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b91668072704601a012ff16cdf0b6"><name>42</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Editor's Advisory: Early morning fire destroys research lab at UCSC</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin/Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1010732400000</start-date><display-name>Editor's Advisory: Early morning...</display-name><path>/2002/01/42</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/42</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337902897</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337902897</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Fire was confined to a suite of laboratories on the fourth floor; no injuries are reported</b></p><p>A major fire in Sinsheimer Labs triggered an alarm at approximately 5:30 a.m. today (Friday, January 11).

The limestone ridges where the tree grows are among the most botanically rich areas in Vietnam and certainly harbor many other undescribed species, but they are outside the country's protected reserves, said Daniel Harder, director of the Arboretum at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a codiscoverer of the new species.</p><p>Harder spent several years in Vietnam as the founding director of a botanical conservation program for the Missouri Botanical Garden. During that time, he and his collaborators discovered more than 100 new species of plants. But the conifer now known as the golden Vietnamese cypress is by far the most remarkable of those discoveries, he said.</p><p>"For us to find a previously undescribed large tree like this indicates that there is probably a lot more to be discovered there," Harder said. "It's comparable to the recent discoveries of previously unknown large mammals in Southeast Asia, like the giant muntjac and the saola, a type of ox."</p><p>Other scientists involved in the conifer discovery included Vietnamese botanists Nguyen Tien Hiep and Phan Ke Loc, Russian botanist Leonid Averyanov, and Philip Cribb from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom. They found the trees clinging to steep limestone ridges in a mountainous area known as Bat Dai Son near the Chinese border. The scientists knew they had found something interesting and sent specimens of the plant to one of the world's leading conifer specialists, Aljos Farjon at Kew. Farjon was initially skeptical of the group's reported find, but when he received the specimens he was ecstatic, Harder said. </p><p>"He's spent 25 years studying conifers and had never had an opportunity to describe a new species before," Harder said.</p><p>Farjon classified the tree as a new genus within the cypress family (Cupressaceae), and he and the other botanists have named it Xanthocyparis vietnamensis, the golden Vietnamese cypress. Its closest relative is the yellow spruce of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, also known as the Nootka cypress. Previously classified as Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, the yellow spruce is now classified as the second species in the new genus Xanthocyparis. Harder noted that the name change from Chamaecyparis nootkatensis to Xanthocyparis nootkatensis is not likely to sit well with horticulturists and foresters because the considerable bibliographic information on this important timber tree is linked to the old name.</p><p>"They dislike it when botanists change the names of familiar species, but these two trees are clearly the closest relatives of each other," he said.</p><p>A formal description of the new species is expected to be published in the next issue of the botanical journal Novon. A description of the tree's natural habitat and associated species will appear soon in another botanical journal.</p><p>A distinctive and unusual feature of the new species is that it bears two different types of foliage on mature trees: needles and scale leaves. It produces fine, yellowish-brown, hard, fragrant timber that is highly prized by the local people. Logging has reduced the number of larger trees, but some very large and stately specimens still grow on the steep, rocky slopes of isolated mountain peaks, Harder said. The mountaintop ridges in Bat Dai Son hold remnants of a forest that was once much more widespread, he added.</p><p>"This tree was already rare and endangered when it was discovered, which lends urgency to putting in place some protections," Harder said. "These limestone mountains might actually harbor other valuable species, and it's all part of the national heritage of Vietnam."</p><p>Based on the work of Harder's botanical conservation program within Bat Dai Son, the provincial government of Ha Giang Province has established the Bat Dai Son protected area. Provincial protection is the first step toward national and international protection, Harder noted.</p><p>In addition to the cypress, the collaborative team of botanists exploring the area has found about two dozen new orchid species, a variety of interesting new shrubs, and numerous herbs and bulbs, including a half-dozen new species in the Jack-in-the-pulpit family (Araceae). </p><p>"We have sent specimens to specialists around the world, and that has really stimulated a lot of interest in the flora of Vietnam," Harder said. </p><p>Harder has made plant conservation a central programmatic theme for the UCSC Arboretum since taking the helm as director in October 2001. He noted that the Arboretum already has a significant collection of conifers from around the world, in addition to its renowned collections of plants from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. But conservation involves much more than growing rare plants in the gardens, Harder said. </p><p>"We want to be active partners in conservation efforts to protect not only the plants themselves but also the habitats in which they grow," he said. "I also see education as an important part of conservation, and we have a role in explaining for the public the significance of rare and threatened plants. The Arboretum has a lot of work to do in these areas."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Harder at (831) 427-2998 or dkharder@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b94048072704601a012fff668423b"><name>44</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall 2002 freshman applications to UCSC up 6 percent</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1011164400000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2002 freshman applications...</display-name><path>/2002/01/44</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/44</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337903571</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337903571</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Undergraduate applications to the University of California, Santa Cruz, for fall 2002 increased 6 percent among freshman applicants and 5.3 percent among transfer students compared to the totals received last year.

It can take weeks, however, for scientists to determine that an algal bloom is producing a potentially deadly toxin. Now researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, hope to catch toxin-producing algae in the act by following their genetic footprints, thanks to a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation. </p><p>The three-year project will focus on harmful algal blooms caused by certain species of diatoms (single-celled algae with glass shells) in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Led by Raphael Kudela, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, the project also involves researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. </p><p>Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in Monterey Bay from late spring to early fall. The algae produce domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin that can cause nervous twitching, disorientation, short-term memory loss and even seizures and brain damage in vertebrates. Domoic acid is passed up the food chain from diatoms to small fish and copepods to larger fish, seabirds, sea mammals, and even humans. Domoic acid was first recognized in 1987 on Prince Edward Island, Canada, when 150 people became ill and four died from eating blue mussels that were contaminated with domoic acid. Domoic acid was also blamed for the deaths of 100 brown pelicans and cormorants in Monterey Bay in 1991 and 50 sea lions that washed up along the coast of California from San Luis Obispo to Santa Cruz in 1998. </p><p>But not all Pseudo-nitzschia blooms are toxic.</p><p>"Pseudo-nitzschia can turn toxin production on and off," Kudela said. "Right now we can use molecular probes to tell us whether or not Pseudo-nitzschia is in the water, but it can take several weeks to determine if there is toxin in the water. We have to tell people to stop fishing while we're waiting for results, even though the toxin may not be there." </p><p>In addition to Kudela, the research team includes UCSC professor of ocean sciences Jonathan Zehr, Virginia Ambrust at the University of Washington, and G. Jason Smith at Moss Landing. The project seeks to identify genes that are activated when toxin production is switched on in Pseudo-nitzschia, and to make probes that will identify when these genes are active. Such probes can be used to test for toxin production in the field and to measure toxin output under various laboratory stress tests.</p><p>The team will search for genes associated with domoic acid production by identifying the genes that are active only in toxic Pseudo-nitzschia. Scientists can identify all the genes active in a cell at one time by fishing out intermediary copies of the gene that are only made when a gene is turned on. Pseudo-nitzschia algae can be made toxic in the lab by depriving them of silica, the nutrient they use to make their glass shells. Kudela's team will make separate libraries of all the active genes in nontoxic Pseudo-nitzschia and those in toxic Pseudo-nitzschia, and compare the two collections.</p><p>"We just subtract one set of genes away from the other set, and we should be left with a handful of genes that went from being turned off to being turned on when the algae went from being not toxic to toxic," Kudela explained.</p><p>From there, it would be straightforward to make a gene chip that lights up when it catches domoic acid-related gene products in seawater. Such a chip would be a "huge advantage" in monitoring for toxin production in the field, said Kudela.</p><p>The chip could also be used to answer the question of why Pseudo-nitzschia makes domoic acid. The diatoms produce domoic acid "anytime they're not happy," Kudela said. But scientists don't know exactly what makes them unhappy. The gene chip could be used to test domoic acid production in potentially stressful conditions, such as nutrient shortages and excesses. Kudela said he plans to test Pseudo-nitzschia in a low-iron setting, because he suspects that Pseudo-nitzschia may secrete domoic acid to help bind and sequester iron, based on results published by UCSC ocean sciences professor Kenneth Bruland and his lab group. </p><p>"It may be possible that, once we know exactly why they're producing domoic acid, we could come up with strategies to keep them from doing it," Kudela said. For example, if domoic acid production is related to iron deficiencies, a solution might be to add iron to the ocean during algal blooms.</p><p>People have been studying Pseudo-nitzschia since at least 1991 and have come up with many suggestions for when and why domoic acid is made, but they don't have a lot of concrete answers, Kudela said. "If we tackle it from a molecular perspective and look at what's happening in the cell, maybe it will become more obvious," he said.</p><p>Kudela's grant was obtained through the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms program (ECOHAB). ECOHAB is an interagency research program that supports studies on harmful algal species. Participating agencies are the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Office of Naval Research.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Raphael Kudela at (831) 459-3290 or kudela@cats.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b96ad8072704601a012ffca72b601"><name>46</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Press forum on January 28: The crisis in schools</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1011682800000</start-date><display-name>Press forum on January...</display-name><path>/2002/01/46</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/46</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337904254</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337904254</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>National leaders discuss underprepared teachers, the crisis facing poor districts, risk to students</strong></p>
<p>More than half of all new teachers in California last year entered the profession underprepared, and teachers who lack full credentials are concentrated in the state's poorest schools. In 2000-01, 1.7 million children in California attended schools in which 20 percent of the teachers were underprepared.</p>
<p>How can we address the challenge of teacher preparation in the midst of the state's acute teacher shortage? How does teacher quality affect student performance? The crisis in teacher quality that is plaguing California schools will be addressed on Monday, January 28, at 9:45 a.m., when three of the nation's top leaders in education conduct an open press forum in at the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose. Participants are:</p>

Holmes, a founding member of the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a beloved artist and art historian, died in a Santa Cruz hospital on January 21 after a brief illness. She was 91.</p><p>Holmes, who grew up in various towns in the West, and in Chicago, began her career as a painter and became equally well-known for her work as an art historian, hosting a series of community lectures, as well.</p><p>Holmes loomed larger than life for many, and her personal magnetism was legendary.</p><p>"She was remarkable in many respects," said John Dizikes, a fellow founding faculty member and a close friend. "She was an incomparable colleague, there was no one like her. She was delightful company. I admired her intense professionalism as an art historian, which she rather disguised because she was full of so many eccentric opinions. Above all I admired her courage; she was indomitable, that's the word." </p><p>Prior to her time at UC Santa Cruz, Holmes was a lecturer at University of California, Los Angeles. In 1953, during her tenure at UCLA, Holmes hosted a highly rated educational television program, "Art 5A," which was based on her university lectures. Holmes's affiliation with UCSC began in 1965 when she arrived from Los Angeles as a lecturer in art; she was promoted to associate professor of art in 1971 and retired, as a full professor, in 1977.</p><p>Holmes was a painter of visionary and mythical forms, though she chose to teach art history rather than painting, telling a reporter once that she thought it was "very dangerous for anybody who wants to paint to teach painting. I've seen it destroy I don't know how many people."</p><p>Holmes lived for many years on a 100-year-old ranch on a mountaintop farm above Happy Valley Road, in rural Santa Cruz, with a menagerie of animals. For 20 years, she faithfully attended the Penny University, a salon-style gathering she co-founded with old friends and UCSC colleagues historian Page Smith and philosophy professor Paul Lee. The group, which was open to everyone and often drew hundreds, met every Monday at 5 p.m. at various Santa Cruz locales to exchange ideas, opinions, and float intellectual balloons. The Penny University continues to meet in Santa Cruz.</p><p>Holmes earned an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Hollins College in Virginia and a master's in art from the University of Iowa. She also attended the University of Berlin, the Academie Collorossi in Paris, Johns Hopkins University, and the Art Students League. </p><p>Of her degree in philosophy, Holmes once joked that it made her "unemployable, which I thought was a smart move since I always planned not to work."</p><p>Fortunately for the Santa Cruz community, that plan didn't work out, and thousands benefited from Holmes's lengthy career.</p><p>Survivors include her son, Michael Adams Holmes O'Malley, and a daughter-in-law, Becky O'Malley, of Berkeley; three grandchildren, Rachel O'Malley, of Santa Cruz, Sara O'Malley, of San Francisco, Eliza O'Malley, of Berkeley; two great-grandchildren; and Bruce Cantz, a friend of 35 years. She was preceded in death by her sister, Sara Holmes Boutelle, the biographer of the architect Julia Morgan. </p><p>A memorial service will take place on Sunday February 3rd, at 2 p.m. in the Calvary Episcopal Church, 532 Center St., in Santa Cruz.</p><p>_____</p><p>Jim Burns and Ann Gibb contributed to this story.</p><p></p><p>To download a photo of Mary Holmes, please go to: <a href="www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914b995a8072704601a012ffce54d560"><name>48</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Editor's Advisory: Reporters invited to cover kickoff of new science education center</title><author>Jennifer McNulty, UCSC Public Information Office, (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1012201200000</start-date><display-name>Editor's Advisory: Reporters invited...</display-name><path>/2002/01/48</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/01/48</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337904939</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337904939</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>What:</strong> The launch of the new Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS), an international collaboration to improve science education by integrating the best of the informal learning that takes place in zoos, aquaria, natural history museums, and "hands-on" science centers with the formal learning that takes place in schools.</p>

The computer will be used for research in planetary physics and astrophysics by scientists in the Departments of Earth Sciences, Physics, and Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>
<p>Research in these fields often involves computer simulations of complex physical phenomena, such as supernova explosions, galaxy formation, and the fluid dynamics of the interiors of stars and planets. UCSC researchers sometimes run their simulations on powerful supercomputers at other institutions, such as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But having comparable supercomputing resources on campus will be a tremendous advantage, said Gary Glatzmaier, professor of Earth sciences and director of UCSC's Center for the Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets (CODEP) within the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.</p>
<p>"We won't have to compete for computer time with researchers at other institutions, and we will be able to involve more graduate students in these projects," Glatzmaier said.</p>
<p>Most of the funding for the new computer was provided by a $538,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. In addition to Glatzmaier, the principal investigators who will be using the new computer are Erik Asphaug, assistant professor of Earth sciences; Stanley Flatté, professor of physics; Joel Primack, professor of physics; and Stan Woosley, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>Woosley noted that computer simulation has emerged in recent years as a "third branch of science," complementing the traditional approaches of observation and theory.</p>
<p>"I think there is a changing paradigm in science as a result of the increasing use of computer simulations," Woosley said. "Simulation involves aspects of both the theoretical and observational approaches. You use theory to create a mathematical model of some phenomenon, but then you have to analyze the data generated by running the model on a computer. And the ultimate test is to compare the output of the simulation against observational data."</p>
<p>Running the simulations requires extremely powerful computers. UCSC's new supercomputer is a "Beowulf cluster," a type of high-performance, massively parallel computer built from standard processors linked together by a high-speed network. UCSC's new Beowulf cluster, built by RackSaver Inc., consists of 132 nodes configured with 264 AMD Athlon 1.4 GHz processors, with 132 gigabytes of memory and nearly 8 terabytes of storage. The system's performance on a standard industry benchmark exceeded 300 gigaflops (300 billion calculations per second), placing it in the 99th position on the Top 500 list of supercomputer sites (see <a href="http://www.top500.org">http://www.top500.org</a>).</p>
<p>This is the third Beowulf cluster installed by researchers in UCSC's Division of Natural Sciences, and by far the most powerful. The two smaller computers, a 16-processor cluster used by Woosley for astrophysics research and a 32-processor cluster used by Asphaug and Glatzmaier, convinced the researchers that this type of system could meet their needs at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>"The small ones are getting a lot of use, but the new 264-processor computer is much more powerful. It's a pretty impressive machine," Glatzmaier said.</p>
<p>Glatzmaier will use the new computer to run three-dimensional simulations of convection and magnetic-field generation in the fluid interiors of planets and stars. He has produced the first self-consistent simulation of the Earth's magnetic field, including spontaneous dipole reversals like those observed in the paleomagnetic record.</p>
<p>Asphaug uses computer simulations to study collisions of asteroids and planets. His simulations have shown, for example, how the Moon may have formed as a result of a collision between the early Earth and another planetary body about the size of Mars.</p>
<p>Woosley studies supernovae, the massive explosions of dying stars, and gamma ray bursts, mysterious blasts of intense radiation. He has developed some of the most sophisticated computer simulations of supernova explosions and gamma-ray bursts. Woosley is director of the Center for Supernova Research, funded by the Department of Energy and headquartered at UCSC.</p>
<p>Primack develops high-resolution cosmological models to study the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in the early universe. His research explores such questions as the origins of galaxies and the nature of the "dark matter" that composes at least 90 percent of the universe.</p>
<p>Flatté studies wave propagation in random media, such as electromagnetic waves propagating through a turbulent atmosphere and sound waves propagating through the ocean.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting these research projects, the computer will be used to train students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in effective parallel programming techniques and in the application of these techniques to problems in their respective disciplines.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents international performance art superstar Laurie Anderson in a newly commissioned solo work titled Happiness on Sunday, March 10th 2002 at 8pm at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. A departure from her more technically complex multimedia shows, Anderson's inward-looking Happiness is befittingly more flexible and in the moment, giving full breadth to her ability to keep an audience surprised, curious and involved.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>In part a self-portrait, Happiness marks the first time Anderson has drawn directly on so many experiences from her own life. Thinking about deception and fiction, Anderson explores "the stories," she says, that "we tell ourselves so that we can go on." The piece looks at contemporary culture through the filters of the evolution of behavior, learning and memory, the nature of justice, and the effects of technology. This performance on the UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures series will be one of the first presentations of her new work in the U.S. The music played, DJ'd and otherwise devised by Anderson in Happiness is rooted in a pulse and a metronome. The sounds are a combination of keyboards, violin, and digital processing as well as several MIDI triggers.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>Once the l'enfant terrible of New York's avante-garde, Laurie Anderson has reigned as one of the premier performance artists in the world with a reputation as a luminary in the high-tech universe of multimedia performance art. A self-described "storyteller," Anderson dares to discuss thoughts and feelings that many rarely verbalize. Her artistic career has cast her in roles as various as visual artist, composer, poet, photographer, filmmaker, ventriloquist, electronics whiz, vocalist and instrumentalist.</p>
<p>Anderson's O Superman launched her recording career, rising to number two on the British pop charts and subsequently appearing on Big Science, the first of seven albums for Warner Bros., including Mister Heartbreak, United States Live, Strange Angels, Bright Red and the soundtrack to her feature film Home of the Brave. A deluxe box set of her Warner Brothers' release Talk Normal was released in fall of 2000 on Rhino/Warner Archives and her award winning CD-ROM, Puppet Motel, was recently re-released by Voyager. Her latest album, Life on a String, was released in 2001 by Nonesuch to the delight of The New York Times who proclaimed, "she writes killer tunes."</p>
<p>Laurie has just completed the entry about New York for the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents internationally acclaimed jazz pianist Marcus Roberts with his famed trio at the UC Santa Cruz Music Center Recital Hall on Saturday, February 16, 2002 at 8:00pm. Mr. Roberts, one of the pre-eminent jazz pianists of our time, is joined by Jason Marsalis on drums and Roland Guerin on bass. The telepathic chemistry of the trio is evident on their latest album, In Honor of Duke, a celebration of the creative spirit of the great Duke Ellington. Unlike the traditional jazz trio which holds the piano as the central focus, Guerin and Marsalis are featured equally and share responsibility for spontaneously shaping the tempo, mood, texture, and overall form of the music. It's a musical high-wire act, but one that Roberts feels is natural for this group, which has played together for over four years.</p>
<p>A pre-performance Meet-the-Artist Discussion begins at 7:30pm.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The 36 year-old Marcus Roberts made his name as a key member of Wynton Marsalis' ensembles in the late eighties and early nineties. Since then he has established himself as one of the ultimate musical traditionalists for his remarkable keyboard style and thorough perception of jazz as a dynamic influence in the evolution of American music. All of Roberts' recordings, whether solo piano, trio, big band, or with symphony orchestra, have been critically acclaimed, including his Grammy-nominated recording of George Gershwin's signature classic, Rhapsody in Blue. Though this Gershwin classic has been recorded many times, Roberts' version (with full orchestra) on his 1996 Sony release Portraits in Blue marks the first time that the piece has been completely rewritten with the personalized interpretations of a particular artist. In his 1996 release of original compositions, Time and Circumstance (Columbia), the trio explores, as Roberts says, "the nuances and timing of all the critical events of a love relationship." Both 1996 albums have been praised for taking the creative art of improvisation to new heights. As one of the most diverse artists of our time, Marcus Roberts' work is continually evolving with a clear sense of direction. His deep respect for the contributions and achievements of the great masters of jazz and classical music fires his pursuit of new ways to bring the dynamic sounds of these two genres together.</p>
<p>Jason Marsalis, praised highly for his solo albums, has also been touted by his older brothers Branford and Wynton Marsalis as the family member with the lion's share of the jazz talent. His drumming displays vitality, originality and technical virtuosity. Roland Guerin, a native and resident of Baton Rouge, has mastered and redefined the slap bass style, and enriches any musical environment with his musical wit, strong country groove and relaxed swing.</p>
