Should it influence which political candidate we vote for, whom we hire, or what we teach our children in school?</p><p>	A new book by John M. Doris, associate professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Cruz, argues that people often profoundly overestimate the behavioral impact of character and in turn, underestimate the impact of situations. Drawing on a vast array of psychological studies, Doris found that circumstance has an extraordinary effect on how people actually behave, regardless of whatever character they appear to have.</p><p>	"A lot of research suggests that moral behavior is absurdly situationally-sensitive," Doris explained.  "At the same time, a great deal of research in psychology indicates that differences among personalities--say whether someone is introverted or extroverted--are poorly related to predicting behavior. We've found that surprisingly trivial factors are important. For example, there is evidence that people are more likely to help others if the environment smells good."</p><p>	In his book, <i>Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior,</i> Doris applies the implications of this research to a wide range of issues in ethics, culture, and moral psychology.</p><p>	"Our tendency is to make snap judgments on next to no data," Doris said. "This is going to cause unjustified admiration on one side, and unjustified condemnation on the other. For instance, voting on character is not the way to go, rather than voting for a candidate's platform. If Bill Clinton has adolescent sexual taste, we can't predict that he will have adolescent views on foreign policy. But those are the kind of thoughts that people put together."</p><p>	"One problem with the emphasis on character is that it's very unclear what our notion of character comes to," he added. "Yet it distracts us from issues that are much more important."</p><p>	A self-described "analytic" philosopher working in ethics and moral psychology, Doris takes an interdisciplinary approach to philosophy. He insists that research in experimental social psychology undermines familiar philosophical assumptions that date back to Aristotle.</p><p>	"I take a detailed look at research and how it impacts moral theory," Doris explained. "I try to suggest a different way of thinking about ethical theory--one that is more empirically sensitive. It's more interdisciplinary, getting philosophers to be more psychological and psychologists to be more philosophical. It's basically doing philosophy with a wider angle lens."</p><p>	As a result, Doris takes on the concept of character or "virtue" education in his book.</p><p>"We do not know as much as one would like about the relation of educational interventions to moral behavior," Doris said. "As far as I can tell at this point, there is not a lot of systematic empirical research--as opposed to anecdotal reports--suggesting that 'character education' is especially effective in promoting morally desirable behavior in children. If my skepticism about character is right, it probably isn't smart to bet the ranch on such evidence appearing."</p><p>Doris said that he hopes by being methodologically self-conscious, he will provide a model for others who analyze and influence social behavior.</p><p>"The point is not to make judgments about people and history, but to expect that behavior varies with situation and context. Maybe instead of talking about how to develop humane characters, we should talk about developing humane institutions," he added.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c7f9b8072704601a012ff60d8b2cb"><name>263</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers observe electronic dynamics of strongly interacting gold nanoparticles using ultrafast laser spectroscopy</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Jin Zhang, nanoparticles, nanoparticle research, ultrafast electronic dynamics</keywords><start-date>1039158000000</start-date><display-name>Researchers observe electronic dynamics...</display-name><path>/2002/12/263</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/12/263</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337963883</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337963883</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have reported the first observations of ultrafast electronic dynamics in a system of strongly interacting gold nanoparticles. The observations are an important advance in nanoparticle research, because the development of practical devices using metal nanoparticles depends on understanding how they interact.</p><p>Jin Zhang, an associate professor of chemistry at UCSC, and a team of graduate students in his laboratory used femtosecond laser spectroscopy to probe the fundamental optical and electronic properties of aggregated gold nanoparticles. Their ultrafast laser system enabled the researchers to observe processes that occur on the timescale of a picosecond (one trillionth of a second).</p><p>The researchers measured the absorption of light by gold nanoparticle aggregates, and studied how the absorption changed as electrons in the particles were excited to a higher energy level and then returned to their ground state. This process, called electronic relaxation, takes about one or two picoseconds (the exact time depends on the amount of power in the laser pulses used to excite the sample). Unexpectedly, the electronic relaxation dynamics of the nanoparticle aggregates exhibited periodic oscillations, which Zhang attributed to coherent vibrations of the aggregates.</p><p>"This is the first direct observation of vibrational oscillations of nanoparticle aggregates," he said. "Femtosecond spectroscopy is the only way to study this and other fundamental dynamic properties of such aggregates." </p><p>Zhang's team reported its findings in a paper published by the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society.</i> Graduate student Christian Grant is first author of the paper, which was published online on December 5 and will appear in print in an upcoming issue of the journal. The other coauthors are Adam Schwartzberg and Thaddeus Norman, both graduate students at UCSC.</p><p>The unique optical properties of gold nanoparticles have been recognized since the Middle Ages, when colloidal gold provided the intense red color in stained glass windows. More recently, metal nanoparticles have attracted attention for their potential uses in optoelectronic devices, sensors, and other applications. So far, however, most studies of the optical properties of metal nanoparticles have focused on isolated particles, Grant said.</p><p>"We need to understand how the particles interact and what properties arise from those interactions--this is fundamental knowledge that will help in designing practical devices," he said. </p><p>Gold nanoparticles have a characteristic absorption spectrum that is affected by interactions between the particles. A key feature of the spectrum is a peak, known as the "transverse plasmon band," at a wavelength of about 520 nanometers. In a system of weakly or moderately interacting particles, this peak shifts toward longer (redder) wavelengths. When the interactions between particles are very strong, as in the aggregates studied by Zhang's lab, an entirely new absorption band appears in the near-infrared region of the spectrum.</p><p>Zhang's group was able to show that this broad absorption band in the near-infrared is made up of many sub-bands that correspond to absorption by aggregates of different sizes and shapes. The periodic oscillations they observed in the electronic relaxation profiles provided a critical clue. These "coherent vibrational oscillations" result from the interaction of the excited electrons with the lattice structure of the aggregates, Grant said.</p><p>"When we excite the electrons we are putting in energy, and the electrons relax by dumping that energy mainly into the vibrations of the nanoparticles or, in this case, into the vibrations of the entire aggregate," Grant said. </p><p>When they measured the electronic relaxation dynamics at varying wavelengths, the researchers found that the period of the oscillations varied with the probe wavelength. The findings suggested that aggregates of similar size and structure in the sample are all vibrating with the same frequency.</p><p>"It's like the strings on a violin," Zhang said. "The thicker the string, the slower the vibrations, and the lower the frequency of the tone it produces." </p><p>Previous work by other researchers studying isolated gold nanoparticles showed vibrational oscillations with periods proportional to the size of the particles. Whereas isolated nanoparticles show oscillations at wavelengths corresponding to the transverse plasmon band, the aggregates showed oscillations at wavelengths corresponding to the near-infrared band. </p><p>To confirm that the near-infrared band is made up of discrete sub-bands, the researchers performed a "hole-burning" experiment. This involved exciting the sample with an intense laser beam at a single wavelength to disrupt the aggregates that absorb at that wavelength. The absorption spectrum of the sample then showed a distinctive change in the near-infrared band, from one broad peak to a pair of peaks separated by a dip at the "hole-burning" wavelength. "The aggregates that absorbed at that wavelength were probably broken up into smaller aggregates," Grant said.</p><p>In future work, the researchers will try to learn more about how the structure of nanoparticle aggregates affects their optical properties.  </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Zhang at (831) 459-3776 or zhang@hydrogen.ucsc.edu, and Grant at (831) 459-3912 or grant@chemistry.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c80d98072704601a012ff8130f182"><name>264</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Banana slug inspires new children's book dedicated to UC Santa Cruz campus mascot</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sally Slug, banana slug, Anne Levin, Patricia Rebele</keywords><start-date>1039676400000</start-date><display-name>Banana slug inspires new...</display-name><path>/2002/12/264</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/12/264</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337964185</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337964185</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A chance encounter with a banana slug on a rainy-day visit to UC Santa Cruz has inspired the plot of a brand-new children's book dedicated to the campus mascot.</p><p><i>Sally Slug,</i> written by Anne Neufeld Levin and illustrated by Patricia Rebele, explores a day in the life of a colorful banana slug family that lives beneath the redwoods on the UCSC campus. Young Sally, her brother Stanley, and their parents, Mugg and Pugg, slide into some sticky situations in a story that comes complete with its own special "slug" terminology.</p><p>	"Stanley is supposed to 'slug-sit' for Sally while her parents attend the Cowell Creek Banana Slug Derby," explained Levin, "but he shirks his duties and Sally slips away into the forest. Sally meets another slug from the other side of the mountain named Daisy. They become best friends and are rescued from their misadventure by a wonderful frog named Umphy."</p><p>	"It all ends very happily with a celebratory picnic," Levin added. </p><p>	All proceeds from the book will benefit the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and will provide for art history purchases and Special Collections exhibits in the University Library.</p><p>"The banana slug was voted Best College Mascot by Sports Illustrated some years back, and many people have said it's a shame that more hasn't been written about slugs," Levin noted. "This all started as an exciting way to do something creative for us and bring a little benefit to the university."</p><p>Levin is a UC Santa Cruz Foundation past president and has served as a trustee for 15 years. She endowed the Neufeld Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies in 1995, further supported by her family's archive in Special Collections of the University Library. Levin and her husband, Paul, have been strong supporters of the university, contributing to a wide variety of programs and organizations including scholarships, the Long Marine Laboratory, the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, and research in the natural sciences. She has been a Santa Cruz resident for almost four decades.</p><p>Rebele is a graduate of Porter College at UCSC, where she and her husband, Rowland, endowed the Rebele Chair in Art History in 1996. They have supported numerous community arts organizations over the years, including Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the Cabrillo Music Festival, and the Santa Cruz Symphony. Rebele studied at the Academy of Art in San Francisco and enjoys doing watercolors in her travels. A longtime resident of Aptos, she has served as a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation for nine years. </p><p>Levin showed Rebele her story after seeing snapshots of some paintings that Rebele had completed on a recent trip to Morocco.</p><p>"Pat came into this by a wonderful accident," Levin recalled. "I asked her to look at the story and within a week, she gave me a few sketches that brought tears to my eyes. She had painted the characters exactly as I had pictured them. She actually brought them to life."</p><p>The book contains more than 20 bright, whimsical watercolors detailing the slug family's adventure in the forest surrounding the UCSC campus. Rebele mused on why the slug is such an appealing character.</p><p>"I think the bright yellow color appeals to kids," she said. "For little children, banana slugs are small and not frightening at all. And of course, it's such an unusual mascot for a university. And these slugs have personalities of their own. A child can use his imagination and make up his own story about where a slug lives and what his family is like."</p><p><i>Sally Slug</i> will be available in local bookstores beginning on December 16.

The collection includes their landmark documentary series of photos of members of the Black Panther party in 1968, just published in a new book by Greybull Press, and recently exhibited at the Shapiro Gallery in San Francisco. </p><p><b>Note to Reporters:</b>  High-resolution images are available for download at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/index.html">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a></p><p>A colleague of Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange, Jones had his first retrospective covering 60 years of photography last year at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. His work portrays a broad view of 20th-century California, ranging from a collaboration with Lange documenting the destruction of the Berryessa Valley, to the growth of the wine industry, small forgotten towns, the hippie movement, the city of San Francisco, and the landscape of the northern California coast.</p><p>  The work of Jones and Baruch has been exhibited at museums around the country, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution. </p><p>The Jones/Baruch donation consists of 160 vintage gelatin-silver prints from the original exhibitions of A Photo Essay on the Black Panthers (1968) and Walnut Grove: Portrait of A Town (1961). The photographs will be housed in the Special Collections of the UC Santa Cruz Library along with their complete archive. The university has exceptionally strong photographic archives that include work by many of the country's most distinguished photographers such as Edward Weston, Philip Hyde, Victor Jorgensen, Erik Lauritzen, Morley Baer, Steve Crouch, and Al Weber. </p><p>Jones became acquainted with UC Santa Cruz in 1969 when he served as a teacher at a workshop held by legendary photographer Ansel Adams on the 2,000-acre campus, set amid redwood forests and rolling meadows.</p><p>"I was extremely pleased with the beauty of the campus," Jones said. "And the mood and the attitude there was something that I had never seen before. It is one of the most unique universities anywhere."</p><p>The Panther series of photographs came about in 1968 when Jones's wife Ruth-Marion Baruch was introduced to Kathleen Cleaver, wife of Black Panther party leader Eldridge Cleaver. Given unprecedented access to the inner circle of the Black Panthers, Jones and Baruch took photographs from July through October of that year in an effort to create a better understanding of the controversial organization that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover once called "the greatest threat to the internal security of the United States."</p><p>"Ruth had made contact with the Black Panthers--Kathleen and Eldridge Cleaver," Jones recalled. "We would bring stacks of prints to them every week for use in their newspaper and for whatever else they wanted them for. At the time, everything in the press was negative and always out for shock value."</p><p>An exhibition of these photographs at San Francisco's de Young Museum in 1968 drew more than 100,000 people despite nearly being canceled due to unfavorable press.</p><p>"The de Young exhibit was one of the most important events in my life," Jones said. "The energy we put into it--I'm amazed that we put it together in such a short time. It was a great opportunity."</p><p>	 Jones and Baruch's photo essay, Walnut Grove: Portrait of a Town, documents a small, racially diverse community that was displaced by a freeway on the Sacramento River Delta. Jones said the 1961 project came about purely by chance.</p><p>	"We were coming back from a visit in the mountains and happened to take the road along the levee. We saw a little town and decided to turn around and take a look at it," he said. "We liked the diversity of people that lived there and the mix of different cultures. But we had no definite outline or plan. We went in and just took photos of things that interested us.</p><p>	"It was a wonderful thing--the Panther and Walnut projects," Jones added. "No one controlled us or our point of view. No funds were available. It was just us doing things that we loved to do. And both those projects show a point of interest. They have a definite opinion--this is how we feel."</p><p>	Now 88, Jones taught photography at the San Francisco Art Institute from the late 1960s until his retirement from teaching in 1997. He currently lives in Mill Valley, California.</p><p>_____</p><p>The Black Panther photos are slated for an upcoming show at the Berkeley Art Museum from March 26 through June 29, 2003. Pirkle Jones' retrospective is currently at the Monterey Museum of Art through December 29 and will travel to the Marin Community Foundation from April through June, 2003. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c8b228072704601a012ff855c7c4a"><name>272</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mouse genome sequence published with first comparative analysis of mouse and human genomes</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>genome, mouse genome, bioinformatics</keywords><start-date>1039071600000</start-date><display-name>Mouse genome sequence published...</display-name><path>/2002/12/272</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/12/272</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337966803</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643405758739</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers in the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, made significant contributions to the analysis of the mouse genome sequence announced this week by the international Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.

<p>The achievement represents a landmark advance for the Human Genome Project. It is the first time that scientists have compared the contents of the human genome with that of another mammal. This milestone is all the more significant given that the laboratory mouse is the most important animal model in biomedical research.</p>
<p>David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the CBSE, and CBSE research scientist Jim Kent both worked on the analysis of the mouse and human genomes and are coauthors on the Nature paper. Their previous contributions to the assembly and analysis of the human genome sequence, which was published last year, earned them widespread acclaim. Other members of the UCSC genome bioinformatics group who are involved in the mouse project and listed as coauthors on the paper include graduate students Ryan Weber, Krishna Roskin, Mark Diekhans, and Robert Baertsch; postdoctoral researcher Terrence Furey; software project manager Donna Karolchik; and software developers Angie Hinrichs and Matt Schwartz.</p>
<p>Kent has created a web-based mouse genome browser similar to the browser he created for the human genome. The browser allows scientists around the world to download data and detailed, customized analyses of the genome. The mouse and human genome browsers and other useful tools for researchers are available on the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC genome bioinformatics site</a>.</p>
<p>The mouse sequence provides scientists a powerful research tool to extract meaning from the human genome sequence. It allows them to recognize functionally important regions in the human genome by virtue of the fact that they are conserved through the 75 million years of evolution separating humans and mice.</p>
<p>"Regions of DNA in genomes evolve under Darwinian selection when they perform a useful function, or under random neutral drift when they do not," Haussler said. "Comparing the human genome to the mouse genome, we can see the statistical evidence for selection in some regions and study the properties of the neutral drift in others."</p>
<p>About 95 percent of the human genome looks like it is evolving under neutral drift, Haussler said. Surprisingly, the rate of neutral drift varies regionally along the chromosomes, with some regions drifting faster than others. The researchers were not able to identify any features of the DNA that would account for these variations in mutation rates.</p>
<p>About 5 percent of the genome contains sections of DNA that are conserved between human and mouse. Because these DNA sequences have been preserved by evolution over tens of millions of years, scientists infer that they are functionally important and under some evolutionary selection.</p>
<p>Because the mouse carries virtually the same set of genes as the human but can be used in laboratory research, this information will allow scientists to experimentally test and learn more about the function of human genes, leading to better understanding of human disease and improved treatments and cures.</p>
<p>The mouse genome sequence shows the order of the DNA chemical bases A, T, C, and G along the 20 chromosomes of a female mouse of the "Black 6" strain--the most commonly used mouse in biomedical research. It includes more than 96 percent of the mouse genome with long, continuous stretches of DNA sequence and represents a sevenfold coverage of the genome. This means that the location of every base, or DNA letter, in the mouse genome was determined an average of seven times, a frequency that ensures a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the mouse consortium announced that it had assembled the draft sequence of the mouse and deposited it into public databases. The consortium's paper last week reports the initial description and analysis of this text and the first global look at the similarities and differences in the genomic landscapes of the human and mouse.</p>
<p>The draft sequence of the mouse genome was assembled by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, an international team of scientists at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., Washington University in St. Louis, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute, in Hinxton, England. The project was funded in part by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust in the U.K.</p>
<p>The sequencing centers were joined in the analysis effort by scientists from 27 institutions in six countries. These include Haussler's group at UCSC, as well as computational biologists at Pennsylvania State University, Oxford University in England, the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington University, and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, among others.</p>
<p>The sequence information from the mouse consortium has been immediately and freely released to the world, without restrictions on its use or redistribution. The information is scanned daily by scientists in academia and industry, as well as by commercial database companies, providing key information services to biotechnologists.</p>
<p>The work reported in this paper will serve as a basis for research and discovery in the coming decades. Such research will have profound long-term consequences for medicine. It will help elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. This in turn will allow researchers to design better drugs and therapies for many illnesses.</p>
<p>"Publishing the sequence in 2001 of the first mammalian genome--our own--was a remarkable and historical achievement. To sequence another mammalian genome in less than two years and to discover the treasure trove of information one can derive from a comparison of the two is beyond nearly anyone's dreams. It constitutes a tremendously exciting and defining moment for biomedical research," said Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>
<p>"This is an extraordinary milestone. For the first time we have an opportunity to see ourselves in an evolutionary mirror," said Eric Lander, director of the Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research. "The mouse genome represents a very important chapter in evolution's lab notebook. Being able to read this notebook and compare genomic information across species allows us to glean important information about ourselves."</p>

The researchers reported their findings in a paper published online today by the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres. (The paper will appear in print in a later issue of the journal.) </p><p>The mercury in rainwater is not in itself a health threat, but mercury pollution is a significant problem in San Francisco Bay and other California waters because the toxic element builds up in the food chain. State regulatory agencies are looking for ways to reduce the amount of mercury entering the state's waters from various sources. The new study provides valuable information to guide those efforts, said Russell Flegal, professor and chair of environmental toxicology at UCSC and coauthor of the new paper. </p><p>"People are talking about things like removing dental fillings before cremating bodies, but our analyses indicate that this may be a trivial source of mercury compared to the inputs from industrial emissions in Asia," Flegal said.</p><p>Interestingly, it is not just the mercury itself but a whole cocktail of atmospheric pollutants that contribute to the deposition of mercury in rainfall. Elemental mercury behaves as a gas in the atmosphere and is not washed out in rain until it has been oxidized into a charged ionic form that can be captured by water droplets, said Douglas Steding, the paper's lead author.</p><p>Ozone, a major component of urban and industrial smog, plays a key role in this oxidation process, said Steding, who did the study as a graduate student at UCSC and is now studying environmental law at the University of Washington.</p><p>"There is a relatively large reservoir of mercury in the atmosphere, and it's the rate of oxidation that determines how much of it gets deposited in rainfall," he said.  </p><p>Mercury is a trace contaminant of most coal, and emissions from coal-burning power plants are a major source of mercury pollution in many parts of the world. In the Pacific Basin, the main source of atmospheric mercury is coal combustion in China. China relies heavily on coal as a fuel and accounts for about 10 percent of the total global industrial emissions of mercury.</p><p>Air pollution in China also generates ozone, which peaks during the winter due to increased fuel consumption for heating. Air loaded with mercury and ozone moves off the continent into the Western Pacific, where it is incorporated into developing storms. </p><p>"The mercury we measured in rainwater results from a combination of mercury emissions and ozone production, as well as meteorological factors--the storm tracks that transport the pollutants across the Pacific," Steding said.</p><p>Steding collected rainwater samples at two sites in central California: on the coast at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory and at Moffett Field near San Jose, on the inland side of the Santa Cruz Mountains. For each rainfall event, the researchers used air mass trajectories calculated by a national climate lab to trace the movement of the storms across the Pacific from Asia. </p><p>Rainwater collected at the coastal site showed the background concentrations of mercury in storms as they arrived directly off the Pacific Ocean. Those measurements were about three times higher than estimates of the natural, preindustrial level, Steding said.</p><p>Rainwater from the inland site showed mercury concentrations 44 percent higher than at the coastal site. Steding tentatively attributed the difference between the two sites mostly to ozone in Bay Area smog, rather than local emissions of mercury.</p><p>"There is a local influence of urban smog on the mercury oxidation rate. We see a background signal of mercury blowing off the Pacific, then a local enrichment that's probably due to urban smog," he said. "If we want to reduce mercury deposition, it's not enough to shut down local emissions of mercury, because other pollutants influence how much of the mercury in the atmosphere ends up in rainwater."</p><p>Steding emphasized that people should not worry about health effects from the mercury in rainwater, because the concentrations are very low. But the deposition in rain does add mercury to surface waters, where the toxin enters the food chain and builds up to high levels in certain kinds of fish. State health officials have issued advisories warning people not to eat fish from more than a dozen bodies of water in California, including San Francisco Bay.</p><p>Much of the mercury contamination in California is the result of historic mining operations. Large amounts of liquid mercury were used in gold mining operations during the Gold Rush, leaving contaminated sediments throughout the vast watershed that ultimately drains into San Francisco Bay. In addition, Flegal's lab has shown that historic mercury mine sites in the Coast Ranges are still leaching mercury into rivers and streams that drain into San Francisco Bay. </p><p>Prior to this new study, however, no one had looked at atmospheric transport of mercury from Asia as a source of mercury pollution on the U.S. West Coast, Flegal said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Flegal at (831) 459-2093 or flegal@etox.ucsc.edu, and Steding at (415) 203-6615 or dsteding@u.washington.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2833a3a8072704601a012ff1fb14796"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626763224</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626763224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2833a3a8072704601a012ff1fb14796"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626763224</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626763224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
