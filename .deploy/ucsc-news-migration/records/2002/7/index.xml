The 10-week conference season began on June 16 and wraps up on August 14.</p><p>This year's conference lineup has been affected by university budget cuts and the economic slump, said Nancy D'Angelo, assistant director of the Colleges and University Housing Services. "It does tend to affect us. Our business is cyclical," she said.</p><p>Budget cuts at the Educational Partnership Center forced it to scale back a few of its summer programs at UCSC, D'Angelo said. On the other hand, early indications point to an increase in sports programs for grade school and high school-age youngsters. D'Angelo speculated that this could be a result of tighter family budgets. "Many times people don't take vacations, but they want to see that their children are taken care of," she said.</p><p>In addition to their direct benefit for participants, summer programs also serve to showcase the campus. "Each of these precollegiate visitors is a potential student. It's a wonderful opportunity," said D'Angelo, noting that the Admissions Office offers campus tours for visitors. </p><p>Conferences have an impact on the surrounding community as well. Many of the sports camps draw youth from nearby, and visitors from outside the area explore community attractions, shopping or spending money at the Boardwalk, and elsewhere, said D'Angelo.</p><p>UCSC receives more than $4.2 million annually from the summer programs. Conference guests stay at UCSC residence halls and apartments, purchasing food and other services from the campus. Income from summer visitors helps offset room-and-board rates for UCSC students by about $200 per student each year. Income is also returned to UCSC's colleges to help support student programs.</p><p>Programs for adults include:</p><p>The 10th Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior. The major goal of this meeting, August 7-11, is to bring together scientists whose interests are in the broad area of food and fluid intake and its related aspects in humans, laboratory animals, and other species. The program will include a keynote lecture by UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood called "Research in the Post 9-11 Era:  Challenges and Opportunities." </p><p><b>The Dickens Project.</b> The Dickens Project will return to the UC Santa Cruz campus for its 22nd consecutive year in early August to bring together scholars, graduate students, high school teachers, and members of the general public for a week of study and Dickensian conviviality, called "The Dickens Universe." The program includes formal lectures by internationally distinguished scholars, seminars, small discussion groups, films, performances, exhibits, and a variety of informal social activities. Regularly attended by more than 300 participants of different ages and backgrounds, the Universe provides a relaxed and supportive environment in which to pursue serious intellectual inquiry. </p><p><b>UC College Prep Initiative.</b> In partnership with the College Board, the UC College Prep Initiative, July 21-26, hosts an AP Summer Institute annually. Presenters provide high school teachers with opportunities to develop and refine their skills as Advanced Placement instructors. </p><p><b>College Board Summer Institute.</b> The Institute, July 27-August 1, is designed for new or relatively inexperienced admissions and school relations staff and will cover admissions case studies, transcript evaluations, visiting high schools, giving oral presentations, financial aid, testing and testing preparation, stress management and survival skills, international students, and ethical considerations. </p><p>Programs for children and youth include:</p><p><b>The Center for Talented Youth.</b> This comprehensive, university-based initiative promotes the academic ability of children and youth throughout the world. Formally established at John Hopkins University in 1979, it is a leading force in educational reform and improvement in the United States and abroad. By bringing together academically talented students from all over the country, the summer programs are able to offer an unusual educational experience, one geared both to the students' high abilities and to their need for peers who share their academic abilities and their love of learning. </p><p><b>COSMOS.</b> The California State Summer School in Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) at UC Santa Cruz is an academic, four-week residential program for talented and motivated students in grades 8-12. The short courses, not traditionally taught in high school, include astronomy, Earth science, mathematics, ocean science, and more. COSMOS' mission is to motivate the most creative minds of the new generation.</p><p><b>Excel, Putney Student Travel.</b> The mission of Excel programs is to provide challenging, active, fun summer enrichment programs that give students insight into college life while fostering a balance of personal and intellectual growth. Students are invited to broaden their minds, sharpen their athletic talents, refine their artistic abilities, and contribute to a community, while making lifelong friends. </p><p><b>S. E. A. Lab.</b> SEA Lab is a recent addition to UCSC's summer lineup. Sponsored by the SEA Lab Monterey Bay and Monterey Bay Sanctuary, SEA Lab provides one-week residential camp experiences for children in the 5th through 7th grades. In daily excursions to the shoreline just down the hill, campers discover and learn about the ocean as a precious natural resource while enjoying a weeklong camp experience. </p><p><b>United Spirit Association (USA) Camp.</b> Celebrating 52 years, USA brings students, advisers and coaches of cheerleading, drill teams and other spirit groups together for training and encouragement. </p><p><b>Nike Sports Camps.</b> U.S. Sports offers a variety of programs for youth and adults, featuring UCSC coaches in tennis, volleyball, and basketball.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c21cc8072704601a012ff8ae82cbb"><name>161</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz facilities switch to summer hours</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>summer, summer hours</keywords><start-date>1025679600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz facilities...</display-name><path>/2002/07/161</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/161</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337939836</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337939836</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Many UCSC offices and facilities have more limited hours during the summer.

His latest $300,000 gift includes $200,000 to establish the Bhojwani Family Endowed Graduate Fellowship at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The fellowship will provide financial support to students who are the first in their family to attend graduate school. The balance will go toward construction of the new University Center at UCSC, slated for completion next winter. </p><p>	"I've worked for money all my life, but I've told my children that most of my money will go to charity," said Bhojwani, who has also recently purchased and delivered cataract treatment systems to five hospitals in India. "My father always told me, 'Son, you're only a custodian for this money. You have to give it back.'"</p><p>	At UCSC, Bhojwani's generosity will help first-generation graduate students who demonstrate financial need. "If a student wants to go further and do graduate work, we should be encouraging them, don't you think? It's not easy to get degrees," said Bhojwani, whose own college education was cut short after two years when he went to work in the import-export business. He still considers going back to school and has helped each of his own three children earn college degrees.</p><p>Bhojwani's gift will help UCSC pursue its goal of developing stellar graduate programs, said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who has identified graduate education as a priority for the campus. </p><p>"This wonderful gift provides a much-needed boost toward UCSC's goal of fostering superb graduate programs and research innovations," said Greenwood. "And it supports our campus priorities of increasing access and opportunity for tomorrow's leaders."</p><p>	Bhojwani, owner of the former Holiday Inn on Ocean Street leased by UCSC to provide student housing, credits his business savvy with enabling him to retire last year at the age of 59, but he attributes his appreciation of the value of education to his father, who died when Bhojwani was 12 years old. The dining room at the new UCSC University Center will be named in honor of Bhojwani's father, Hemandas Doulatram Bhojwani.</p><p>	From a young age, hardship taught Bhojwani a great deal about life, he said. "I was the youngest of 12 children, and when you're number 12, you're not a priority for anybody. You had to move fast when food was on the table," he recalled with a laugh. When Bhojwani was 12, the family was part of a large migration of Hindus from Sind province, now part of Pakistan, to India. They settled in Bombay. At the age of 18, Bhojwani moved to the United Kingdom, where he established a successful business. He emigrated to the United States in 1979 at the age of 37. His wife and children joined him in 1986. </p><p>	"I've been told I'm the classic case of pulling myself up by my bootstraps from the streets of Bombay," said Bhojwani. "I guess that's true."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c24748072704601a012ffc6d24e14"><name>174</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz trio teams up to publish children's book about time</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>children's books, psychology, dom massaro, clock, time, don rothman, bill rowe</keywords><start-date>1026802800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz trio...</display-name><path>/2002/07/174</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/174</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337940527</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337940527</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Psychology professor Dom Massaro's fascination with time stems from a visit to his son's second-grade class, where Massaro observed youngsters having trouble learning to tell time. That experience inspired him to invent a kid-friendly clock, the award-winning Kid Klok. His curiosity piqued, Massaro went on to explore the history of time and timekeeping, which he now shares with readers of the new book Time to Learn About Time, coauthored by Don Rothman and illustrated by Bill Rowe.</p><p>	The book is tailored for youngsters ages 8 to 12, though adults will learn a lot, too, including how clocks are made, why clocks run clockwise (think sundials, which mimic how a shadow moves in the Northern Hemisphere, where the sundial was invented), and the origin of the "a.m." and "p.m." designations for the two halves of the day.</p><p>	Massaro, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, teamed up with Rothman, a writing instructor and director of the UCSC-based Central California Writing Project, to write the text, and he tapped Rowe, a research associate in the Division of Natural Sciences, for the line drawings of everything from Cronus, the Greek god of agriculture, to the gear mechanisms of a mechanical clock.</p><p>	In this age of digital watches, Massaro makes a case for preserving the analog clock, which he said helps develop important abstract, perceptual, and cognitive skills.</p><p>	"The traditional clock is a leftover from history, not an efficiently designed, easy-to-read device like a digital timepiece," said Massaro. "But no one should assume digital time will replace analog clocks. After all, analog clocks have withstood the test of time." </p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: Dominic Massaro may be reached at (831) 459-2330 or via e-mail at massaro@fuzzy.ucsc.edu.

Associate Dean Joel Ferguson was elected to serve as one of the organization's four directors.</p><p>The Silicon Valley Engineering Council (SVEC) is an alliance of engineering leaders in Silicon Valley. Founded in 1989 as a nonprofit educational organization, the council brings together several local engineering and technical societies, coordinating activities and assisting communications to better serve its members and the community. Ferguson, for example, represents the local chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on the council. </p><p>In addition to promoting professional activities among the engineering societies, the SVEC is involved in educational activities and programs in local schools. </p><p>"It is important to help educate young children about the values and excitement of being an engineer," Kang said. "The SVEC also recognizes people who have made outstanding contributions to Silicon Valley industry with its Hall of Fame awards. The Hall of Famers can be role models for the younger generation of engineers and scientists."</p><p>Kang said he decided to get involved in SVEC in part to increase UCSC's presence in Silicon Valley and raise the profile of the campus's five-year-old engineering school. </p><p>"As dean of a young engineering school, I saw the need for more outreach and the opportunity to provide more services to the engineering community in Silicon Valley," he said.</p><p>The goals of the SVEC include sponsoring and promoting educational activities and programs; promoting the career development of engineers and other technical professionals; and promoting public service by the engineering and technical societies and their members. The organization's outreach programs include Discover "E," a nationwide program to expose elementary school and junior and senior high school students to engineering and cultivate their interest in math, science, and engineering. The SVEC has coordinated the Discover "E" effort in the South Bay area since 1992.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c27608072704601a012ff09b112c7"><name>176</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: UCSC commencement for new teachers on July 19</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Teacher shortage, California education, teaching credentials</keywords><start-date>1026889200000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: UCSC commencement...</display-name><path>/2002/07/176</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/176</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337941256</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337941256</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Unique program combines teacher's credential and master's degree</b></p><p>What:	Commencement for 115 graduates of UC Santa Cruz's Master of Arts in Education Teacher Preparation Program, which offers a combined teaching credential and master's degree in five quarters.</p><p>When:		Friday, July 19, 10 a.m to 2 p.m.</p><p>		</p><p>Where: 	UCSC Quarry</p><p>Who:		115 students are graduating with Master's degrees and teaching credentials. </p><p>Eugene Garcia, dean of Arizona State University's College of Education and formerly a professor and dean at UCSC, will deliver the commencement address, "New Beginnings: Challenges and Opportunities."

By condensing a two-year program into 15 months, the Education Department has blended hands-on preparation and scholarship in a program that is getting more qualified teachers into classrooms quickly.</p><p>The number of teachers working with "emergency credentials" has skyrocketed since class sizes were reduced. By speeding up the credentialing process without sacrificing the quality of preparation, UCSC is setting the standard in teacher preparation.

Local audiences can see Bodies in Crisis at the Rio Theater, 1205 Soquel Avenue, Santa Cruz, on July 25 at 8 p.m. The Santa Cruz performance is a fundraiser for the dance company's travel expenses to the Fringe Festival. </p><p>Bodies in Crisis began when students in the UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department were seeking a way to use art as a tool for healing following the terrorist attacks. Performance artist and director of Bodies in Crisis Shakina Nayfack, then a student in UCSC's fifth-year certificate program in theater arts, traveled to New York to interview artists about their experiences on and after September 11. The conversations focused on the role of art in challenging a war mentality and creating a space for healing. Nayfack returned to Santa Cruz and, working with eight other UCSC theater arts students, created an original dance-drama collaboration called Ragesties, the first step in the evolution of Bodies in Crisis. </p><p>Ragesties premiered at UCSC during the winter of 2002. "I saw the show and I was amazed," said Ruby Monsen, a recent graduate of UCSC's theater arts program. Monsen was so impressed she volunteered to become artistic producer for Ragesties. "I felt it was a positive way for people to work through their pain about September 11 from the inside out, especially after we had been inundated by media coverage."</p><p>Each of the Ragesties 10 dance poems explores images from media coverage of September 11. The starkly named segments include: "The Airplanes," "The Escape," "The Panic," "The Collapse," and "The Bridge." Nayfack and her colleagues created the dance poems using Ankoku Butoh, a Japanese dance form developed in the early 1960s. Ankoku Butoh, which mean "Dance of Darkness," is a ritualistic dance form demanding integration of the dancer's body, mind, and spirit. The cast of Ragesties devised physical exercises to locate specific emotions within the body, and kept reflective journals about the process. Excerpts from these journals became the poetic text of the performance.</p><p>Following a two-week run of Ragesties to sold-out audiences at a campus venue, the company continued developing their performance. "Because America has changed in the almost 10 months since September 11 and we are all still healing together, the production had to change. It's not a static art form," said Monsen.</p><p>The core of the performance, including the original cast and electronic music score, remains the same. But as Ragesties evolved into Bodies in Crisis, it focused more directly on the individual performers. "Our goal," said Monsen, "is to demonstrate the internal tension between patriotism and anarchy, mourning and anger, fear and hope."</p><p>Tickets for the July 25 performance of Bodies in Crisis are $15 general admission, $10 for students and seniors, and will be available one-half hour before the performance at the Rio Theater Box Office.

Differences in the editing of genetic information may, in fact, be a significant source of genetic variability. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have now taken a big step toward understanding how this editing process (known as splicing) is regulated.</p><p>Using DNA microarrays (also called "gene chips"), the researchers are able to analyze the editing of all the genes in a cell simultaneously. This enables them to study how mutations or environmental perturbations affect the editing process.</p><p>"In the past, you had to analyze one gene at a time, but now we can look at all of the genes in parallel," said Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. </p><p>Master copies of all of an organism's genes are found on the chromosomes in every cell. When a gene is "expressed" or activated, its DNA sequence is copied into a "messenger RNA" molecule. The messenger RNA directs the production of a protein molecule, but not before a bit of cutting and splicing of the RNA code. </p><p>In the genes of higher organisms (as opposed to bacteria), the protein-coding information is broken up into fragments called "exons" that are separated by long sections of noncoding sequence called "introns." The splicing of pre-messenger RNA involves cutting out the introns and joining together the exons. The most striking thing about this process is that there are often several and sometimes many different ways to splice together the exons of a particular gene.</p><p>"It's estimated that more than 50 percent of human genes produce alternatively spliced messenger RNAs," Ares said. "To study this, we started by looking at yeast, because yeast genes have very few introns. The yeast genome is sort of a toy version of the bigger genomes of more complex organisms like humans." </p><p>Applying the microarray technique to yeast, Ares and his coworkers obtained the first genome-wide view of RNA splicing for any organism. They published their findings in the May 3 issue of the journal Science. Tyson Clark, a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is lead author of the paper. Coauthor Charles Sugnet is a graduate student in computational biology.</p><p>Ares's lab is also looking at RNA splicing in other organisms, including humans. For example, graduate student Valerie Welch has developed a set of microarrays to analyze changes in splicing as human cells in tissue culture progress from normal to cancerous states, and as cells are infected by viruses.</p><p>The idea that every gene acts by directing the production of a specific protein--known as the "one gene, one protein" hypothesis--was a Nobel Prize-winning milestone in the development of modern biology. But alternative splicing means that genes are actually much more complicated than that, and some genes can produce many proteins through alternative splicing. Most cases of alternative splicing involve just a few different versions, but one gene in the fruit fly apparently generates 38,000 different versions of its messenger RNA. </p><p>In humans, a good example is the gene for tropomyosin, a structural protein. Alternative splicing gives rise to five different versions of tropomyosin, which are produced in five different tissues in the body: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, fibroblast, liver, and brain. Cells in each type of tissue splice the 11 exons of the tropomyosin gene differently to produce the different forms of the protein.</p><p>"The coding sequences of our genes are all broken up and spread out, and there is a whole cellular machinery involved in patching it together so that the code makes sense. This splicing process gives the cell the ability to try new combinatorial arrangements of information," Ares said. "You have all this information in the genome, but then the cell can interpret it in different ways. Our microarray technology allows us to access all that information in the cell at one time."</p><p>The technique depends on the recognition of the unique sequence created when two exons are spliced together. The initial step of identifying these splice-junction sequences involves comparing the genome sequence with the "expressed" sequence. To do this, Ares works with bioinformatics researchers led by David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC. Sugnet performed this analysis for the yeast genome.</p><p>"He was able to identify the splicing events and, in each case, give us the coding sequence that spans the junction between the two exons. Then we created a synthetic DNA molecule that can recognize that sequence and spotted it onto the microarray," Ares said.</p><p>The microarrays for the yeast study consisted of glass slides with tiny spots of synthetic DNA laid out in a grid pattern. For every intron-containing gene in the yeast genome, the microarray included three synthetic DNA probes: splice-junction probes to detect spliced messenger RNA; intron probes to detect unspliced RNA; and exon probes to detect both spliced and unspliced RNA. RNA extracted from yeast cells and tagged with fluorescent labels was then placed on the microarray, allowing the RNA molecules present in the cells to bind to the specific DNA probes. </p><p>The intensity of the fluorescence at each spot serves as an indicator of the relative abundance of the corresponding RNAs. The microarrays are analyzed with an instrument that measures the fluorescence at each spot.</p><p>The researchers compared splicing patterns in normal and mutant strains of yeast. The mutations affected various factors known to be involved in the processing of messenger RNA molecules. In general, the results showed that the effects of RNA processing factors on splicing events depend on the particular intron involved. </p><p>"Each splicing event has its own character. When you alter the cell in some way, it's hard to predict the consequences for any particular intron," Ares said. "We hope to use our data to figure out what the rules are, why some splicing events depend more on certain parts of the RNA processing machinery than others."</p><p>Ares is already extending this work to human genes, starting with genes involved in cancer (tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes). Other researchers have reported that the splicing of some cancer genes changes as the cancer progresses.</p><p>Ultimately, Ares wants to understand the mechanisms that regulate RNA splicing in all cells. RNA splicing is basically an interpretive process--the genetic information contained in the genome is interpreted differently in different contexts. </p><p>"That interpretive process, and how it varies within a population, has really not been explored in any organism, including humans," Ares said. "I'd like to look at how much polymorphism [i.e., genetic variability] there is in the human population as far as how genes are interpreted."</p><p>This could be an important factor in understanding genetic diseases. The severity of certain genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, varies tremendously depending on the patient's genetic background. In other words, the severity of the disease in two people with the same genetic defect might be quite different because of differences in other genes. Ares said differences in RNA splicing may have a lot to do with that.</p><p>"We know of cases where the way the disease gene is handled by the splicing machinery is different in different people," he said. "We have a lot to learn about this kind of variation."</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Ares at (831) 459-4628 or ares@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c2b558072704601a012ff97ad283c"><name>179</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jane Smiley to speak at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Charles Dickens, Jane Smiley, UC Santa Cruz, Dickens Universe</keywords><start-date>1027321200000</start-date><display-name>Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jane...</display-name><path>/2002/07/179</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/179</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337942275</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337942275</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>She's well known for her novels, but when writer Jane Smiley speaks at the Dickens Universe conference at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it will be in a different guise: As a biographer of the man himself, Charles Dickens.</p><p>	Smiley, author of Charles Dickens (New York: Viking Press, 2002), will read from and discuss her biography of Dickens on August 1 at 3:45 p.m. in Kresge College Town Hall.

The CLRDP and the wetlands report are also available online at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html">www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html</a> and in compact disc format. The free CD may be ordered by calling (831) 460-3570. </p><p>Written comments on the draft plan are due by September 1, 2002, at the UCSC Campus and Community Planning Office, 515 Swift St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060.</p><p>A UCSC planning committee, which includes representatives of the city of Santa Cruz and staff from the California Coastal Commission, has been working since fall 1999 to develop plans for the Long Marine Lab site, including the 55 acres acquired by UCSC in spring 1999. </p><p>In December of that year, the committee adopted a set of planning principles for developing the site as a marine research and education center that were presented to the public at an open house.</p><p> </p><p>The university hired a consulting team--EHDD Architecture, a San Francisco firm that developed the original Long Marine Lab Master Plan over 20 years ago and also designed the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and BMS Design Group, also from San Francisco--to prepare the Coastal LRDP for the site. In spring 2000, the consultants and the planning committee met with interested parties in a series of focus-group workshops. Environmental groups, agricultural interests, and the Terrace Point Action Network were among the participants in the focus groups.</p><p>At the second public meeting, held in June 2000, the consultants and the planning committee presented the input they had received from the focus groups. In addition, consultants unveiled six different schematics, showing how the site might be developed as a marine research and education center.</p><p>At the third public meeting, held in October 2000, three site concepts were presented and discussed. In December 2000, meanwhile, the expansion of Long Marine Lab was discussed at a meeting of the Coastal Commission in San Francisco. Commissioners at that meeting asked UCSC staff and consultants to reexamine the boundaries of a seasonal pond and the drainage areas that make up the wetlands on the site.</p><p>The results of that wetlands review were discussed at a workshop in July 2001. A revised site plan was also presented, reflecting past discussions about incorporating research and educational facilities on the site, preserving open space on the site, and providing housing that would support the needs of the marine programs there.</p><p>The draft report was completed following that workshop and will be discussed by UCSC staff and project consultants at the upcoming workshop.</p><p> </p><p>The draft will serve as the basis for the Coastal Long Range Development Plan--and accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR)--that the university will prepare for consideration by the UC Regents and the California Coastal Commission, probably sometime next year. (An Environmental Impact Report Scoping Meeting for the CLDRP was held in November 2001 to seek comments on issues to be discussed in the draft EIR.)</p><p>For maps of the site and additional information, go to the web site: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html">www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c2db38072704601a012ffb9f93e28"><name>181</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz publishes biography of longtime local resident Hal Hyde</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Hal Hyde, McHenry Library, oral-history, library, randall jarrell, Harold A.

A fifth-generation Santa Cruz County resident, Hyde has been in on the creation of organizations and institutions ranging from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Cabrillo College to the Community Foundation and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County.</p><p>"In those days when something was needed and you didn't have an organization to do it, then you'd start one," said Hyde with considerable modesty. His contributions to California and Santa Cruz are documented in his oral history, <i>Harold A. Hyde: Recollections of Santa Cruz County</i>, which will be published July 30 by the UC Santa Cruz Library's Regional History Project. Regional historian Randall Jarrell conducted the interviews with Hyde and edited the volume, which extensively documents 20th-century Santa Cruz County history and the founding of UCSC.</p><p>Following infantry combat service with the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II and graduate studies in business at Harvard, Hyde returned to Santa Cruz County and a career at Ford's Department Store. By the late 1950s he was chairing a committee to promote a local bond issue for higher education, had been elected to Cabrillo College's first board of trustees, and was also on a local committee helping the University of California select a Central Coast location for a new campus. All this was in addition to his position as merchandising manager of Ford's. </p><p>After the UC Regents selected the Cowell property for their next campus and named Dean McHenry founding chancellor, McHenry approached Hyde with a suggestion. "He said, 'You're spending so much time in higher education, have you thought of it as a career?'" recalled Hyde. "And he offered me a job."</p><p>That job, vice chancellor of business and finance, made Hyde responsible for the start-up of all nonacademic aspects of the new campus. Central to Hyde's work was overseeing creation of UCSC's infrastructure, including construction of the first colleges, residence halls, and administrative buildings, and the siting of campus roads. He also hired key staff. "It was Dean McHenry's show but we had a lot to do to carry it out," said Hyde. </p><p> </p><p>Hyde held the vice chancellor position from 1964 to 1975, a period in which the campus grew from no students and some decaying ranch buildings to an enrollment of 5,600 students with modern classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, playing fields, performing arts theaters, and administrative buildings, including those for Lick Observatory.</p><p>"It was a major challenge on a beautiful site," said Hyde, who even had to create his own work space by managing the renovation of a Cowell Ranch building into offices for himself and his colleagues. He had direct responsibility for campus fire and police support during a tenure that included student protests against the Vietnam War and a fire, started by faulty lamp wiring, in the central administration building. The fire caused no injuries but forced the entire administrative staff to temporarily relocate to Family Student Housing apartments below Porter College, then called College Five, where one of Hyde's daughters was a student. </p><p>Hyde's commitment to UCSC continued after he returned to retailing in 1975. He was a founding member of two UCSC support groups, serving as the first president of the Arboretum Associates and a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. </p><p>"I guess I'm an 'Old Blue,'" said Hyde, who graduated from Berkeley in 1947. "If you stuck me I'd probably bleed blue and gold."</p><p>The Hyde biography, as well as other oral-history volumes documenting UCSC history, are available in Special Collections at UCSC's McHenry Library and at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library. The volumes may also be purchased for the cost of duplication.

Pister, chancellor emeritus of the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a prestigious international award from the World Technology Network (<a href="http://www.wtn.net">www.wtn.net</a>) for his leadership in educational outreach.</p><p>	Pister was appointed vice president of outreach to the K-12 system for the University of California after leaving UCSC in 1996. He received the individual 2002 World Technology Award for Policy at a gala event in New York City on July 22.</p><p>	"To win a World Technology Award reflects the esteem in which peers hold your work--esteem not only for the technical brilliance of your efforts but for the broader impact those efforts will likely have on shaping the world in which we live," said James Clark, chairman and founder of the World Technology Network. "Through winning this World Technology Award, I am delighted to welcome Karl into the World Technology Network family." </p><p>	Pister was honored for his work creating opportunities for educationally disadvantaged students.</p><p>	"Most of my professional life has been devoted to teaching and research in engineering sciences," Pister said during the award presentation. "In due course I changed roles, serving as a dean of engineering, chancellor of a campus, and vice president of a university responsible for outreach to the K-12 school system. It was there that it became apparent that creating and implementing policy for education was substantially more challenging than solving technical problems."</p><p>	Prior to his five-year tenure as chancellor at UCSC, Pister spent 45 years at UC Berkeley as a professor in the College of Engineering and as an academic administrator. He served as dean of the college from 1980 until 1990.</p><p>	At UCSC, Pister was a tireless advocate for K-12 outreach, establishing the Monterey Bay Educational Consortium to foster collaboration between the campus and public schools and expanding outreach to the region's 13 community colleges. He also established a generous scholarship program that helps community college students transfer to UCSC.</p><p>	The World Technology Network (WTN) award gives Pister admission into the network and access to its resources. During the ceremony, he was presented with a trophy created by designer Stefano Marzano, chief executive officer and chief creative director of Philips Design, who received the 2001 World Technology Award for Design.</p><p>	Pister was selected as the result of a six-month selection process in which nominees were solicited from 100 leaders of technology-related fields and considered by the network's 430 voting members. Among those nominating individuals for the 2002 awards were representatives of academia, government, business, and nonprofits, including NASA, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Centre for the Management of Environmental Resources in France, Fujitsu Ltd., and Seoul National University. </p><p>	Established four years ago, the World Technology Network brings together leading individuals and corporations from 20 disciplines to encourage innovation and the exchange of ideas. Specific disciplines include the arts, biotechnology, education, energy, environment, ethics, health, information technology, law, policy, and space. </p><p>	The awards ceremony marked the final event of this year's two-day World Technology Summit, which took place at the Millennium Conference Center and United Nations headquarters. In addition to the annual summit, the World Technology Network publishes a journal and hosts an ongoing global series of roundtable dinners, chapter meetings, and other events.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c89ba8072704601a012ff66b17ba7"><name>271</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz increases outreach to industry</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Todd Wipke, biomedical research</keywords><start-date>1027321200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz increases...</display-name><path>/2002/07/271</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/271</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337966466</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337966466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On a sunny afternoon in June, the <i>Chardonnay II</i> set sail from Santa Cruz harbor with a passenger list that included researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and CEOs of regional biotech and high-tech companies. As the 70-foot sailing yacht cruised past dolphins and sea otters under a flawless blue sky, passengers exchanged business cards and their conversations turned to technical subjects. </p><p>"The goal was to make new connections between UCSC and industry and to promote collaborative research," said organizer Todd Wipke, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. "We have organized several events like this in the past few months that have been very successful."</p><p>While the vast majority of funding for UCSC research comes from federal grants, a growing number of researchers also receive some funding through collaborative partnerships with private companies. In addition to the funding opportunities they offer, university-industry partnerships can help research projects move more quickly toward practical applications.</p><p>Wipke, who serves as campus liaison to the UC Office of Technology Transfer, has been working to encourage more interest in industry partnerships.</p><p>"This campus has never done much outreach to industry, but that is starting to change," Wipke said. "We want people in industry to know about the opportunities for collaborative research at UCSC." </p><p>Most university-industry collaborations at UCSC involve biomedical research or engineering and computer technology. These are also areas in which the campus has been expanding its faculty.</p><p>Ali Shakouri, associate professor of electrical engineering, was one faculty member who made a useful connection during the cruise on the Chardonnay II, which was followed by dinner at the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. Shakouri, whose work involves measuring temperatures in computer chips, got acquainted with Cliff Warren, CEO of Raytek, a local company that makes devices for infrared temperature measurements. </p><p>Although the highly specialized applications of Shakouri's work make a direct collaboration with Raytek unlikely, Warren said the company would be very interested in working with undergraduate and graduate students involved in projects like Shakouri's that involve infrared optics, physics, electronics, and software. </p><p>"My students would have a good background for Raytek, and [Warren] had some good ideas for projects that they could work on at Raytek for a senior thesis or a summer job. It would be a good experience for the students," Shakouri said. "This kind of dialogue with local companies is important, so I thought it was a very helpful event," he added.</p><p>Wipke is especially eager to increase the visibility of biomedical research at UCSC. For a campus without a medical school, UCSC does a surprising amount of biomedical research, he said. The campus receives about $10 million annually in research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), making NIH the campus's second largest funding source after the National Science Foundation. </p><p>In addition to the informal gathering Wipke organized in June, there have also been more formal events. At a meeting at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center in April, for example, industry representatives and UCSC faculty gave brief presentations about their research. </p><p>One purpose of these events has been to educate both faculty and industry about UC programs that are available to support collaborative partnerships. These include the <a href="http://uc-lsit.berkeley.edu">Life Sciences: Information Technology program</a> (LS:IT) and the <a href="http://uc-biostar.berkeley.edu/">Biotechnology Strategic Targets for Alliances in Research</a> (BioSTAR) program.  </p><p>Both LS:IT and BioSTAR are UC-wide matching-grant programs that partner industry sponsors with UC researchers. State funding for the grants is matched at least dollar for dollar by industry sponsors. LS:IT sponsored the events Wipke organized in April and June, and a similar meeting in May, organized by professor of chemistry and biochemistry Anthony Fink, was sponsored by BioSTAR. </p><p>Several UCSC researchers have received grants through the BioSTAR and LS:IT programs. Wipke, for example, has had a drug development project sponsored by Roche Bioscience through BioSTAR and another sponsored by Affymax through the LS:IT program. Fink and Bakthan Singaram, also a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, both have grants through BioSTAR. Fink's grant is sponsored by Amgen and Singaram's by GluMetrics.</p><p>Industry collaborations offer more than just increased funding for UC researchers. Interactions with industry researchers can contribute significantly to a research project, Wipke said. The arrangement sometimes gives university researchers access to valuable proprietary information the company has not made public. In addition, graduate students gain useful exposure to industry research, and the companies get to meet graduate students they may be interested in recruiting. </p><p>Intellectual property issues are handled through agreements worked out for each grant. Discoveries made through research performed at the university are, in principle, the intellectual property of the university. But typically the university will give an exclusive license back to the company that sponsored the research, Wipke said. Things get more complicated when the company does further development and modification of an idea or product on its own.</p><p>"A lot depends on the exact nature of the research, so for each grant there is a specific arrangement that spells out how intellectual property is handled," Wipke said.</p><p>Robert Miller, vice chancellor for research, has proposed a Technology Enterprise Center at UCSC to manage intellectual property issues, as well as to facilitate the development of new ventures based on the campus's intellectual property. </p><p>"University-industry partnerships offer benefits to both parties, and I am very interested to see UCSC develop more interactions with industry," Miller said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a28255888072704601a012ff0e6264c0"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626704707</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626704707</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a28255888072704601a012ff0e6264c0"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626704707</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626704707</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
