The exhibit documents a 30-year tradition of typographic study and exploration, and also includes later work by Cowell Press alumni, including printmaker and author Tom Killion, miniature book artist Peter Thomas, and fine press artist Felicia Rice. </p><p>"The exhibit's title comes from the students' goal at the Cowell Press: to take a text and present their understanding of it, typographically," said Gregory Graalfs, a UCSC alumnus who helped organize the exhibit. "I took a class at the Cowell Press, and it opened up a world of typography and bookmaking for me." Graalfs, who graduated with an independent major in the art of the book, went on to work in commercial printing, graphic design management, and writing about the history of books and typography.</p><p>As UCSC's founding faculty and staff were preparing to open Cowell College, the first of UCSC's 10 residential colleges, they discovered an old printing press. This press, most likely a relic of the Cowell Ranch, inspired the college's 1973 purchase of a modern letterpress proof press and a metal type case with an entire family of Bembo type.</p><p>"Everything we printed was in Bembo, because that's all we had," said Peter Thomas. "The first thing I printed was a verse from the Bible, because it seemed as classic as the typeface. We would spend hours setting and justifying the individual pieces of lead type, getting everything perfect, the laying it in the bed of the press. Once it was all set up, the actual printing process, running the inking rollers and paper over the type, went pretty quickly." </p><p>The Cowell Press, as it became known, was initially housed under the Cowell College dining hall, and later moved to the garage of the Cowell Provost's residence. The press was used in a Book Arts course and for independent work by students who had completed the course. When state budget cuts forced the cancellation of the Book Arts class in the late 1970s, it was refunded through private donations. The high quality of the students' work resulted in an exhibition of their fine-press books at the University of Nebraska in 1981. The Book Arts course continues, taught by lecturer in art George Kane. </p><p>"At the Cowell Press, students work with the basic typographic tools, those used by printers since Gutenberg: metal type, a composing stick, and the letterpress," said Graalfs. "This teaches students the very principles of typography and printing in a tactile way that focuses on the essentials. From these essentials, this exhibit demonstrates how students challenge themselves and the equipment."</p><p>For exhibit hours and more information, call (831) 459-4000.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c53738072704601a012ff614cf033"><name>210</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Reality' in art explored in UCSC lecture and film screening</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sidhartha Maitra, Godzich, reality in art</keywords><start-date>1033542000000</start-date><display-name>'Reality' in art explored...</display-name><path>/2002/10/210</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/210</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337952573</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337952573</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The explosion of "reality" shows during the last few years might make the viewing public think realism is a concept recently invented by television networks. But in "200 Years of Reality Shows," a talk by University of California, Santa Cruz, dean of humanities, Wlad Godzich, true realism in the arts is revealed as something far different from Survivor. Godzich's talk, on October 12 at 7 p.m. in the UC Santa Cruz Music Center Recital Hall, is free and open to the public. </p><p>"200 Years of Reality Shows" is the second Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture and film screening, an annual event sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection and Humanities Division. It will be followed by a reception and then a screening of Ray's 1964 film Charulata (Lonely Wife). Ray's work is well known for his emphasis on reality and humanity. Charulata, which Ray called "my most perfect film," explores politics, passion, and love through the experiences of an upper middle class, western-educated Indian family living in colonial Calcutta. The film is newly restored and includes subtitles. </p><p>The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture series was established by Anuradha Luther Maitra in honor of her husband, who was a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of Ray's work. Maitra was also an early supporter of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection, which was established in 1993 to collect, preserve, and provide scholarly access to Ray's films, papers, books, and artwork.</p><p>In addition to being dean of humanities, Godzich is a professor of literature at UCSC. He has written and lectured widely on humanities topics, including theories of literature and the globlization of culture.</p><p>For more information on the 2002 Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture and film screening, call (831) 459-4012 or (831) 459-4713.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c549f8072704601a012ffc46d5d5d"><name>211</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renowned scholar and author Norman O.

Brown, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of Life Against Death and Love's Body, died October 2 at his residence in Santa Cruz, California. He was 89.</p>
<p>Brown's influential scholarship and teaching encompassed the classics, theology, history, psychology, sociology, and literature, among other disciplines. "He was a liberating, visionary scholar, the successor in the 20th century to Blake and to Nietzsche," said Jerome Neu, professor of philosophy at UC Santa Cruz and a longtime colleague of Brown.</p>
<p>When Brown's prize-winning book <em>Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of History</em> (1959) was published, Lionel Trilling called it "the best interpretation of Freud that I know." It was internationally acclaimed, ranking on the <em>London Observer</em>'s list of best nonfiction books.</p>
<p>"Until I wrote <em>Life Against Death,</em> I was a perfect sleeper," Brown said in a 1970 interview. "But when I learned to interpret my dreams, the power of sleep was taken from me. Freud said he came to disturb the sleep of the world. In my case, he succeeded."</p>
<p><em>Life Against Death</em> disturbed Brown in another way as well. It attracted a wide following among the 1960s activist generation of American students, creating unwelcome notoriety for a man who considered himself not a radical or a revolutionary, but rather a scholar and teacher. An attempt at a psychoanalysis of history, <em>Life Against Death</em> brought Brown fame in a variety of contexts, including the European intellectual community and the American counterculture. In 1966, <em>Time</em> magazine ranked <em>Life Against Death</em> "as one of the underground books that undergraduates feel they must read to be with it."</p>
<p>It was this kind of celebrity that Brown shied away from, and in describing his next book, <em>Love's Body</em> (1966), Brown said, "I did feel.some kind of obligation to undo what I had done in <em>Life Against Death.</em> I wanted to release any followers I had acquired.I don't want to be a leader."</p>
<p>Known to friends, colleagues, and students as "Nobby," Brown was born in Mexico and educated in Europe; he trained in classics at Oxford University. "I wanted to go straight to the heart of the dynamo," was how Brown explained his decision to do graduate studies in America. After getting a Ph.D. in classics at the University of Wisconsin, he began teaching at Nebraska Wesleyan University.</p>
<p>His academic career was interrupted by World War II, during which Brown worked as a research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services. He returned to teaching after the war, chairing the Classics Department at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and then moving to the University of Rochester, where he was a professor of classics and comparative literature. He also published his first book, <em>Hermes the Thief</em> (1947), a sociological interpretation of mythology, greatly influenced by Marx.</p>
<p>Brown joined the faculty at UCSC in 1968 as a fellow of Cowell College and was appointed a Professor of Humanities, the only UCSC faculty member ever given that title. "I believe Norman O. Brown was the most distinguished faculty member in the history of UCSC. Certainly he was a model of what a teacher, a colleague, and an engaged intellectual should be," said Neu.</p>
<p>Brown taught a variety of courses, mostly through the History of Consciousness Department, until his retirement in 1981. His last two books were <em>Closing Time</em> (1973), and <em>Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis</em> (1991), a collection of essays he had written over the course of 30 years.</p>
<p>Brown was known for his erudite and imaginative lecture style, which was often poetic. Speaking at a UCSC commencement in 1984, he told the new graduates: "It is not a matter of having a soul, or of saving it, but more actively a matter of soul-making. The soul is creative and must create itself: it is the creative imagination."</p>
<p>Brown is survived by his wife of 64 years, Elizabeth P. Brown; his sons Stephen and Thomas; daughters Rebecca and Susan; grandsons Alex Brown and Jeremy Gussin; and granddaughters Lisa Brown, Meika Scott-Brown, and Sara Gussin.</p>
<p>There will be a celebration of the life of Norman O. Brown on Saturday, October 19, at 3 p.m. at UCSC's Performing Arts Second Stage (the building next to the Mainstage in the Theater Arts Center). A map of that area of the campus is available at <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/cmartscenter.html">http://maps.ucsc.edu/cmartscenter.html</a>.</p>

Crosby, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the highest honor for excellence in teaching offered by the Division of Social Sciences.</p><p>	Crosby received the division's 2001-02 Distinguished Teaching Award, also known as the "Golden Apple Award," during the dean's annual convocation October 2. Martin Chemers, dean of the Social Sciences Division, presented the award, which recognizes outstanding undergraduate teaching in the social sciences, to Crosby at the breakfast gathering. The award carries with it a cash prize and an engraved plaque.</p><p>	Crosby is a leading authority on affirmative action in education and business and has done research on the subject of balancing work and family. She is the author of Juggling: The Unexpected Advantages of Balancing Career and Home for Women and their Families. Her third area of research is mentoring; she is coeditor of Mentoring Dilemmas: Developmental Relationships within the Multicultural Organization. Crosby was honored for her undergraduate teaching at Smith College and Yale University, where she was on the faculty before coming to UCSC in 1998. She earned her B.A. in European history from Wheaton College and her Ph.D. from Boston University.</p><p>	The Golden Apple Award is presented annually to as many as three faculty members, but Crosby was singled out this year as the solo recipient. In explaining the committee's decision, Chemers said Crosby "lapped the competition."</p><p>	"Every so often, one faculty member stands out so far above the others, and this is one of those times," he said.</p><p>	Crosby was selected by Chemers from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee is chaired by Daniel Press, an associate professor of environmental studies and a former award winner, who said of Crosby, "Students routinely call her the best instructor they've had at UCSC." The annual awards were established in 1991. </p><p>	Social sciences is one of five academic divisions at UCSC; the others are arts, engineering humanities, and natural sciences. Each division is home to a wide range of departments and programs. Social sciences includes anthropology, community studies, economics, environmental studies, Latin American and Latino studies, legal studies, politics, psychology, and sociology.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c57748072704601a012ff9dc183db"><name>213</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz's New Teacher Center hosts 300 new teachers at Children's Discovery Museum October 21</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>New Teacher Center, teachers, teacher training</keywords><start-date>1034146800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz's New...</display-name><path>/2002/10/213</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/213</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337953604</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337953604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Several hundred new teachers will be the guests of honor Monday, October 21, when the UC Santa Cruz New Teacher Center teams up with the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose to honor and encourage them at a festive reception at the museum.</p><p>	More than 450 new teachers are getting support from the Silicon Valley New Teacher Center this school year, and the reception will welcome them and introduce the new teachers to the museum's interactive exhibits and staff resources.</p><p>	"Research validates what we've known all along, which is that good teachers are at the center of successful education," said NTC executive director Ellen Moir. </p><p>The reception takes place from 4:30 to 7 p.m. at the Children's Discovery Museum, 180 Woz Way, in San Jose. Ellen Moir, executive director of the New Teacher Center, and Connie Martinez, executive director of the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, will deliver keynote addresses. Teachers will learn about school-related programs and curriculum support offered by the museum, and they will enjoy hands-on workshops based on the museum's many interactive exhibits.</p><p>	The UCSC-based New Teacher Center provides support for every new teacher by teaming up each novice with an experienced mentor teacher who helps them during their challenging first two years in the classroom. The program's success is evident in the retention rates: About half of all new teachers leave the profession within their first five years of service, while the New Teacher Project has a documented retention rate of 95 percent.</p><p>	The New Teacher Center is dedicated to improving student learning by supporting the development of an inspired, dedicated, and highly qualified teaching force. The center serves 750 new teachers in 27 school districts through the Santa Cruz and Silicon Valley New Teacher Projects and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. The Silicon Valley New Teacher Center opened in 2000 in the UCSC Extension Center at 10420 Bubb Road in Cupertino. </p><p>	Since opening in 1990, the Children's Discovery Museum has been a unique center for learning and discovery for children, families, and schools.

Barron, a World War II veteran and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, died October 6 following complications from a fall. Barron was an internationally influential figure in the study of human personality for nearly half a century. He was 80 years old.</p><p><b>Editor's Note: This obituary was prepared by the family of Frank X. Barron</b></p><p>The pioneering studies of creative writers, architects, research scientists, and mathematicians, which he designed and carried out with other gifted colleagues at the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at UC Berkeley in the 1950s and '60s, still stand as classics in the field of creativity research.</p><p>Barron was an imaginative designer of innovative personality measures and scales that have helped deepen our understanding of personality and personality functioning. His analysis of ego strength as the power to rally from setbacks and hardship anticipated many aspects of what contemporary psychologists now study under the label of psychological resilience. His work played a crucial role in helping to shift personality psychology's focus away from psychopathology toward psychological health and personal vitality.</p><p>His American Psychological Association citation in 1969 for the Richardson Creativity Award honors him: "For his insightful studies of the creative process and of the creative person. For his conceptualization of several significant variables of personality, for his development and standardization of tests to measure those dimensions of personality, and for his researches which have demonstrated their functional role in the creative person: the disposition to originality, preference for complexity, independence of judgment, esthetic sensitivity, ego-strength, and psychological health. For his contributions to our understanding of the psychology of imagination, of the needs for order and disorder as motives in creativity, and of the role of diffusion, integration, and enduring attention in the creative process, especially as these have been revealed in the creative writer. And for the elegance and grace with which he has reported his findings and discussed their implications for the nurturing of creative talent."</p><p>Barron's publications were many. <i>Creativity and Psychological Health</i> (1963) is considered one of the world's major works on the topic of creativity. <i>Creativity and Personal Freedom</i> (1968) and <i>Creative Person and Creative Process</i> (1969) report much of his published work. Other works include <i>Scientific Creativity</i> (1963, with C. W. Taylor), <i>Artists in the Making</i> (1972), <i>The Shaping of Personality</i> (1979), <i>No Rootless Flower: An Ecology of Creativity</i> (1995), and an anthology, <i>Creators on Creating</i> (1997).  A festschrift in his honor, <i>Unusual Associates,</i> was published in 1996.  A book of poetry, <i>Ghosts,</i> will be published posthumously.</p><p>Barron was a Guggenheim Fellow, Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and SSRC Faculty Research Fellow; he received the American Psychological Association's (APA) Richardson Creativity Award (1969) and Rudolf Arnheim Award for outstanding contribution to psychology and the arts (1995).  He was also president of APA's Humanistic Division from 1989 to 1990. He contributed to Scientific American, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Science, Contemporary Psychology, Journal of Personality, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, and other scholarly journals in psychology and education. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, La Salle College, in 1979.</p><p>After coming to Santa Cruz in 1969, Barron taught courses in personality and human creativity, where he charmed hundreds of students with his breadth of knowledge, subtlety of mind, and love of language. He also helped establish UCSC as a campus where serious courses in the psychological study of creativity are routinely offered to undergraduates, where creativity research is a respected enterprise, and where students and faculty alike understand that human creativity can contribute to psychological health, personal freedom, and social well-being. He was a fellow of Porter College and served as chair of the UCSC Psychology Board of Studies, now the Psychology Department.</p><p>Born in the coal-mining town of Lansford, Pennsylvania, he graduated in 1942 as a philosophy major from La Salle. His interest turned to psychology following a summer job as an attendant in a hospital for the mentally ill:</p><p>"On the ward there was hurt and pain so big and so deep that speech could not express it. I had been interested in philosophy, and suddenly philosophy came alive for me, for here the basic questions of human existence were not abstractions: they were embodied in human suffering" (Barron, 1990).</p><p>That year he began his master's degree studies in psychology at the University of Minnesota. WWII intervened, and he served the U.S. Army in Europe as a medic. He returned to complete his M.A. in 1948. He received his Ph.D. in 1950 from the University of California, Berkeley, and taught at Harvard, Bryn Mawr, University of Hawaii, Wesleyan, and from 1969 until his retirement in 1992 at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  He developed much of his work as a founding member of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at UC Berkeley from 1949 to 1968.</p><p>During a 1979 discussion of his work, Barron cited a willingness to take risks as a common characteristic among highly creative individuals: "Creativity requires taking what Einstein called 'a leap into the unknown.' This can mean putting your beliefs, reputation, and resources on the line as you suffer the slings and arrows of ridicule." Barron went on to note: "Other common attributes are a strong motivation to bring order and definition to the world, as well as independent judgment. Creative people are able to go against the mainstream. While in many ways they can be quite conventional, they tend to rebel against conformity as they accompany their own private visions down lonely, untrod paths."</p><p>Barron, with twinkling eyes, gentle heart, humor, fiery spirit, floppy hats, and poems for all occasions, will be missed. Three days before his passing, creating until the end, he began outlining a program of research on attitudes towards death, with belief in life after death as a central variable. On the last day, with his family around, he had this to say: "Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing."  Thank you Frank, for all you shared and the gifts you left. </p><p>Barron is survived by his wife of 42 years, Nancy Jean Barron; his son, Frank Charles Xavier Barron; and his daughters, Brigid Jessica Sarah Barron and Anthea Rose Maeve Barron.</p><p>A mass will be held Saturday, October 12, 2002, at 11:30 a.m. at Holy Cross Church in Santa Cruz, California. Contributions for a student research award in Barron's honor may be directed to the UCSC Foundation, care of John Leopold, Social Sciences 1, Faculty Services, University of California, Santa Cruz, 95064.  Please include "Frank Barron Memorial Award" in the check's memo line.</p><p>_____</p><p>A photo of Frank Barron will be available soon on the UCSC download site at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c59da8072704601a012ffab9cd9f8"><name>215</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: UC Santa Cruz experts available to discuss federal organic rules</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>organic food, organic, organic seal</keywords><start-date>1034319600000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: UC Santa...</display-name><path>/2002/10/215</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/215</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337954216</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337954216</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On Monday, October 21, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's organic seal will appear for the first time on produce and consumer products in the United States. The final step in implementation of the USDA's National Organic Program, the seal will assure consumers that products meet new federal standards for organic production. The federal Organic Rule creates a uniform set of standards covering inputs and practices that farmers and food processors must follow to market their crop or product as "organic" in the U.S. The appearance in the marketplace of the USDA "organic" seal marks a recognition of the significance of organic production in U.S. agriculture.</p>
<p>For 35 years, the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been at the forefront of research, teaching, and outreach about sustainable agriculture generally and organic production specifically. The UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) is the first and only UC program dedicated to sustainable agriculture and food systems, including organic farming, gardening, and marketing practices. The following UCSC faculty and specialists are available to assist in your coverage of the new federal rules.

The issue, which hits newsstands on October 15, features a series of articles about how women fare in science and celebrates the accomplishments of women scientists.</p><p>The three UCSC scientists featured in the magazine are Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics; Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and the Ida Benson Lynn Professor of Ocean Health; and Marcia McNutt, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC and the president and CEO of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. (McNutt is identified in the magazine by her primary affiliation with MBARI.)</p><p>"I'm impressed that three women scientists from UCSC are represented on this list, and I think it reflects the fact that UCSC's science faculty is absolutely first class," Faber said.</p><p>Faber is renowned for her research on the formation and evolution of galaxies and the evolution of structure in the universe. Important concepts such as "cold dark matter" and the "Great Attractor" are direct results of work by Faber and her colleagues. Two of the major optical astronomy ventures of recent years have benefited from Faber's involvement: the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. One of her major projects in recent years has been leading the team that designed and built the DEIMOS spectrograph, a powerful new instrument installed this year on the Keck II Telescope. </p><p>Faber is a core member of the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP) project, a large-scale survey of distant, faint galaxies using the Keck Telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. She is also involved in research on adaptive optics as a senior member of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC.</p><p>Faber's many honors include election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In 1995, she was appointed University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system. She earned her B.A. in physics from Swarthmore College and her Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard University. She joined the faculty of UC Santa Cruz and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory in 1972.</p><p>Williams, an expert in animal physiology and energetics, has studied a wide range of marine mammals, including dolphins, seals, sea otters, and whales. She has also studied land animals, including cheetahs and wild dogs in Africa. Her current research projects include studies of Weddell seals in Antarctica (where she is currently doing field research), Steller sea lions in Alaska, and sea otters in Alaska and California. Her research on dolphins includes ongoing work with the two resident dolphins at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, Primo and Puka. </p><p>Williams is particularly interested in understanding the relationship between an animal's physiology and its environment. Her investigations offer insights into the capacity of marine mammals to tolerate environmental changes. The populations of some of the animals she studies, including California sea otters and Steller sea lions in the North Pacific, have been declining for reasons that are still unclear.</p><p>The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill marked a turning point for Williams, who directed the Valdez Sea Otter Rescue Center and coordinated a scientific research team to assess the effects of crude oil on marine birds and mammals. She said the experience made her realize she could not simply focus on her research and let others do conservation. Williams currently serves as a scientific adviser for California's Oiled Wildlife Care Network and as an adviser to the National Marine Fisheries Service's Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team.</p><p>Williams received her B.A. in biology from Douglass College in New Brunswick, N.J., and her M.S. in physiology and Ph.D. in environmental and exercise physiology from Rutgers University. She came to UCSC in 1993 as a marine research physiologist in the Institute of Marine Sciences and joined the biology faculty as an assistant professor in 1994. In 2000, she became the first faculty member to hold the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health.</p><p>McNutt is a geophysicist whose research focuses on the physical properties of the Earth beneath the oceans. Recent projects include the history of volcanism in French Polynesia and how it relates to broadscale convection in the Earth's mantle, continental breakup in the western United States, and the uplift of the Tibet plateau. Her research is both theoretical and field-based, using data she has collected on nearly two dozen oceanographic expeditions.</p><p>Since 1997, McNutt has been president and CEO of MBARI, a research laboratory in Moss Landing funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to develop and exploit new technology for the exploration of the oceans. A primary focus of the institute is designing and building new tethered and autonomous underwater vehicles and in situ sensor packages for increasing the spatial and temporal sampling of the ocean and its inhabitants.</p><p>McNutt received a B.A. in physics from Colorado College in Colorado Springs and a Ph.D. in Earth sciences from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. She spent 15 years on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she was appointed the Griswold Professor of Geophysics. She is a past president of the American Geophysical Union and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. McNutt joined the UCSC faculty in 1998. She also holds a faculty position at Stanford University.</p><p>Discover magazine's list of the "50 most important women in science" includes eight faculty members of the University of California, representing the Berkeley, Davis, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz campuses.</p><p>_____</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c5f548072704601a012ff61c79ff4"><name>219</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: 'Marine Protected Areas: Scientific Realities and Public Perceptions'...Informational briefing for reporters scheduled for Tuesday, November 19</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-4352; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>marine protected areas</keywords><start-date>1034319600000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: 'Marine Protected...</display-name><path>/2002/10/219</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/219</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337955620</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337955620</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>MEDIA ADVISORY</p><p>What:</p><p>The latest science relating to marine protected areas (MPAs) will be discussed by leading experts in the field.

Recognizing that research shows the quality of the classroom teacher is the single most important ingredient for student learning, the NTC has emerged as a national leader in the development of teacher excellence.  </p><p>	The NTC's expertise is in greater demand than ever as the nation's schools prepare to hire at least two million new teachers over the next decade. Typically, the newest teachers are placed in the most difficult classes in the neediest schools. Alarmingly, half all new teachers leave the profession within the first five years. New teachers who participate in NTC support programs, however, have a dropout rate of only 5 percent. </p><p>	This NSF project will allow NTC to expand its reach by developing an e-mentoring version of its support programs. Called the Virtual Mentoring for Student Success (VMSS) project, the new initiative will tap NTC to design and administer an e-mentoring system to support beginning teachers in six large urban California school districts and a consortium of 90 rural districts in Montana. </p><p>	VMSS partners will create mentoring networks of new teachers, mentor teachers, university faculty members, and school administrators to provide support to beginning science teachers in middle school and high school. Participants will develop national standards for the mentoring and induction of beginning science teachers, and they will create a national e-mentoring network to disseminate the model nationwide.</p><p>	"This is a wonderful opportunity to enhance our work with beginning secondary science teachers in collaboration with science faculty on campus," said NTC Director Ellen Moir. "In taking our mentoring model online, we will develop ways to further our support for teachers as they start their careers."</p><p>	The project is one of 24 new NSF initiatives funded under its new Math and Science Partnership (MSP) program http://www.nsf.gov/home/ehr/, which is designed to improve the achievement of K-12 students in science and mathematics. The VMSS project addresses the number of teachers who are not fully trained to teach math and science.</p><p>    	"These partnerships will become part of a broad national network of interconnected sites that will share successful instructional strategies, entice and train competent science and math teachers and improve learning for millions of students," said NSF Director Rita Colwell.</p><p>     	"One of the key outcomes of these grants will be the improved content knowledge of teachers of mathematics and science in districts across America," said U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige. "This will undoubtedly lead to improved student achievement."</p><p>	The NSTA is the lead agency on the VMSS project, and the NTC will work with six participating school districts: Hayward Unified, Morgan Hill Unified, Mt. Diablo Unified, Gilroy Unified, North Monterey County, and Pajaro Valley Unified. Montana State University at Bozeman will work with Billings Public Schools, Great Falls Public Schools,  Manhattan Public Schools, and consortia representing 90 small rural districts.</p><p>	Occurring both online and face-to-face, mentoring activities will help new science teachers analyze student work to evaluate how well students are grasping basic science concepts, know how this relates to key science standards, and plan necessary changes in the classroom to improve the learning of all students, from middle school to undergraduates/preservice teachers. Four-week-long online study groups will link mentees and mentors with scientists to explore specific standards-based concepts.</p><p>	The effectiveness of the model will be evaluated throughout the five-year project, and the science achievement of VMSS teachers' students will be compared to that of students of non-VMSS novice and experienced science teachers. Participants will showcase the VMSS model to administrators and science teachers at conventions in California and Montana, and at regional and national NSTA meetings. Ultimately, national standards for the mentoring of new science teachers will be developed and disseminated nationally, and the e-mentoring network will be widely replicated.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c62868072704601a012ff7c490229"><name>221</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First UC Santa Cruz course offered entirely online emphasizes student involvement</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>online courses, summer session</keywords><start-date>1034665200000</start-date><display-name>First UC Santa Cruz...</display-name><path>/2002/10/221</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/221</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337956429</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337956429</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, offered its first course taught entirely online during the 2002 Summer Session. Student feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and campus administrators said the course demonstrates the tremendous potential for using web-based technology as a teaching tool.</p><p>The course, Technical Writing for Computer Engineers, made use of custom software developed by the instructor, Tara Madhyastha, an assistant professor of computer engineering. Madhyastha developed the online version of the course after teaching it with conventional lectures for three years. Offered by the Department of Computer Engineering as CMPE185, the course teaches engineers and computer scientists how to write everything from technical reports and documentation to resumes and letters of recommendation.</p><p>"Since I began teaching this class, I have been developing software to allow the students to do progressively more things online, from online submission of assignments to peer editing. Eventually it became clear that there was no need for the lectures," Madhyastha said. </p><p>Many courses at UCSC and other universities have a web site where students can find various kinds of information and materials, but this was UCSC's first course to do away with regular class meetings. Self-assessment and student collaboration were central to the learning experience in Madhyastha's online course. For example, the peer-editing software she developed, called PeerEdit, allowed students to review and comment on other students' work online.</p><p>"In the traditional model for online course offerings, students interact with materials that the instructor posts on a web site. Our philosophy is to harness the students' ability to teach themselves and enable them to interact with each other. That's what peer editing is all about," Madhyastha said.</p><p>Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, said peer review is an effective tool for teaching writing skills, and it is being used in writing programs throughout the country. </p><p>"Students actually learn more about writing by critiquing other students' papers. At the same time, peer review can help alleviate the bottleneck that results when all of the critical feedback has to come from the instructor," Goff said.</p><p>Having students in a large class critique each other's papers, however, presents some logistical challenges that Madhyastha overcame with the web-based software tools she created. She designed the PeerEdit software to work with commercial programs such as WebCT, a platform for creating instructional web sites, and Adobe Acrobat for marking up documents.</p><p>"She is able to use this integrated computer program to set up the assignments, monitor the peer-review process, and really get the students to work together. And on top of that she delivered it as a virtual course this year," Goff said. "It was a tremendous success and we are learning a lot from what she has done. This may be a model that we can scale up and use more widely on the campus to improve writing instruction."</p><p>Madhyastha worked closely with Larry Merkley, campus consultant for information technology, to implement the online version of the course. By offering it during Summer Session, they were able to do a pilot run with a smaller number of students than typically take the course during the school year.  </p><p>"We had a really good experience, and now we want to move forward and see where it can go from here," Merkley said. "I don't see this as something that is going to replace face-to-face teaching, but it can be a very effective approach for certain subjects and for certain students. If you can create an experience online that actually addresses certain needs and helps students learn more effectively, people will want to go in that direction." </p><p>In designing the online course, Madhyastha focused on carefully constructed assignments and self-assessment exercises. Virginia Draper, coordinator of UCSC's Writing Across the Curriculum program, and Holly Cordova, coordinator of the campus's Learning Center, gave Madhyastha the idea of using self-assessment and helped her develop the assignments and self-assessment worksheets.</p><p>Madhyastha told the students what was important for each assignment and asked them to rate themselves and each other on how well they met those criteria. She was available for consultation during extended office hours by phone and instant messaging (like e-mail but without delays, allowing conversation-like exchanges). Students could also come to her office in person, but fewer did so than in the regular class, she said. There were also assigned books, online quizzes, and an online newsgroup for the class (all elements Madhyastha used in the regular course, as well).</p><p>The course has received more than the usual scrutiny of student performance and attitudes. Tests administered during two classroom sessions, one at the beginning and one at the end of the course, are being used to evaluate the effectiveness of the online approach. The results analyzed so far show high student approval ratings, and Madhyastha said the students seemed to be more engaged in the learning process than in the lecture-based course.</p><p>Richard Hughey, chair of the Department of Computer Engineering, said the student evaluations were impressive. All of the students said the course should be offered online again, and they gave Madhyastha high marks for overall teaching, despite the fact that she never gave a lecture. The students also performed phenomenally well, Hughey said, although he noted that the online course may have attracted more self-motivated students.</p><p>"There may have been some self-selection, but the results certainly bode well for using this approach," Hughey said. </p><p>Madhyastha said she feels ready to offer the online course to a larger group of students during the regular academic year. The one part of the course that suffered in the online approach was the segment dealing with oral presentations, she said.</p><p>"Some topics don't lend themselves as well to this mode of teaching, so I'd like to have an additional class session to explain how to give presentations," she said.</p><p>Goff said the campus is exploring other opportunities for online delivery of courses. The goal is not to replace classroom-based teaching, but to use technology to provide additional or enhanced learning opportunities for students, she said.</p><p>"I think it has tremendous potential to provide added benefits," Goff said. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Madhyastha at (831) 459-3285 or tara@cse.ucsc.edu. </p><p>Additional information about the PeerEdit software and related projects is available at the web site of the COLLAGE (Collaborative Approach to Global Education) Project at <a href="http://www.collage.soe.ucsc.edu/">http://www.collage.soe.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c63fc8072704601a012ff3d5c2cc1"><name>222</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New report cites value of virtual education</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin (831) 459-2495; emirwin@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Hernandez, Virtual High School</keywords><start-date>1034838000000</start-date><display-name>New report cites value...</display-name><path>/2002/10/222</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/222</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337956799</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337956799</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elizabeth Irwin</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>emirwin@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California College Prep Initiative (UCCP) released a report today (Thursday, October 17) on the rapidly growing phenomenon of state-funded virtual education in the United States. </p><p>The report, entitled The California Virtual School Report: A National Survey of Virtual Education Practice and Policy with Recommendations for the State of California, was commissioned in order to study the patterns, costs, and effectiveness of statewide virtual programs in meeting educational needs that are not being met by traditional means. UCCP, a University of California program that provides advanced placement (AP) and high school honors courses to underserved populations in California, funded the report to examine how the experience of virtual programs in other states could be applied to the unique educational issues facing California.</p><p>	"California, and the University of California in particular, needs to provide equal access to high-quality education to increase the opportunity for students to attend college," said Francisco Hernandez, executive director of UCCP and vice chancellor for student affairs at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "While we have been reaching underserved populations in the state with AP and honors courses, we realized that this is only the tip of iceberg."</p><p>	Julius Zelmanowitz, vice provost in the UC Office of the President and cochair of the UCCP Systemwide Advisory Committee, noted that, "There are certain benefits that can come from working on courseware development in conjunction with the higher education institutions that will be recipients of today's high school students. Resources in difficult areas such as mathematics can be designed so that teachers can have access to high-quality educational and professional development materials that can be customized to meet local needs."</p><p>	The report outlines the ways in which certain states have centralized the creation and distribution of online courses, teacher training, and curricular resources. While many schools operate one or two online courses, the virtual education programs in the key states provide high school students with educational opportunities both in the classroom and as stand-alone courses to be taken at home. Florida and Michigan, which have the most robust offerings, have been developing these services to provide a new educational delivery mechanism that will be part of the educational infrastructure.  </p><p>	"We have two reasons for doing this," said Nancy Davis, executive director of the Michigan Virtual High School, which has invested $18 million in its statewide program. "First, we can provide what some schools cannot, namely advanced placement courses and remedial programs, and second, to make sure that Michigan's students can compete in the workplace where, increasingly, lifelong learning will be a necessity."</p><p>	The report details how states and large school districts are now embarking on the delivery of their curriculum online. Alan Arkatov, the eLearning consultant for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the nation's second largest school system, is confronting problems that can only be addressed by online systems.  </p><p>	"With more than 750,000 K-12 students, 200,000 adult students, and the need to build out an additional 77,000 seats in just the next five years, LAUSD must supplement its current academic on-the-ground offerings with a rich online curriculum," Arkatov said. "The district's fundamental commitment to access is one that not only will include online AP courses, but areas such as remediation, special education, and professional development. In addition to highlighting the current opportunities available to students and teachers in California and around the country, this report provides an essential road map on where we go from here."</p><p>	The Clovis Unified School District in California's Central Valley provides its teachers with courses purchased from the Florida Virtual School. Report coauthor Rob Darrow, the Clovis online learning specialist, conducted a statewide survey in California and found a receptivity at all levels from students through administrators. </p><p>	"What we found," Darrow explained, "is that students, educators, and parents believe that California should be moving toward some type of collaborative state virtual school program that includes input from local districts, while also providing state content and technology standards for online courses. High-quality online resources can help to meet the challenges of teacher shortages and give students in all parts of the state greater access to a greater array of courses."</p><p>	As this alternate form of delivery becomes more mainstream, other issues present themselves.  Many schools receive their funding based on average daily attendance (ADA) of their student populations. "If a student takes three courses outside of the classroom, this has to be accounted for," said Hernandez. A bill passed in the California Legislature (AB 885) and recently signed into law by Governor Gray Davis recognizes the importance of online learning and now allows school districts to collect ADA for up to two online courses, paving the way for funding of virtual education programs in California.</p><p>	The report, which offers a blueprint for California, concludes that, "Virtual education is here to stay" and, just as electronic technologies have done in banking, health care, and consumer services, such programs will provide the ability to reach students and teachers with consistent, individualized, and high-quality education to augment the classroom and for online delivery. </p><p>	"We will continue to see mixed cases evolving," said the report's coauthor Gordon Freedman, of Knowledge Base, LLC, a California consulting firm. "Some students might take math online to help them with a deficiency while taking history and English in the classroom. In other cases, for a variety of reasons, some students may receive the bulk of their education at home."	</p><p>	The report was produced by Knowledge Base, LLC, of Monterey, California, and the Clovis School District, which won the award as a result of a request-for-proposal process issued by UCCP.   The four-month effort involved a number of surveys, on-site visits, student, teacher, and parent focus groups, and the efforts of a total of 10authors and researchers.

Pettigrew, a research professor of social psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, laments the fact that "hate is in," even though he's getting more invitations than ever to discuss intergroup relations and the hate, prejudice, and hostility between races that underlies many of the world's conflicts.</p><p>	Pettigrew was recently honored for a lifetime of contributions to the field of social psychology when he received the prestigious Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology (SESP). The society, an elected group of top international social psychologists, presents one such award each year. Pettigrew received the award at SESP's annual meeting October 12 in Columbus, Ohio. </p><p>	Pettigrew has been at the forefront of research on racial prejudice for nearly 40 years. An expert on black-white relations in the United States, Pettigrew has also studied intergroup relations in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany. Pettigrew, who studied with the legendary scholar Gordon Allport at Harvard, is widely credited with demonstrating that racism is largely a matter of conformity to social norms and as such can be changed.</p><p>	Much of Pettigrew's work has bearing on today's most intractable conflicts. In a forthcoming paper, Pettigrew argues that both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict see the other as the aggressor, justifying their own actions as defensive. Americans, too, justify a unilateral attack against Iraq as a response to a perceived threat.</p><p>	"In times of war, when people and nations feel threatened, the right-wing element always rises to the fore," said Pettigrew. "It's not just that authoritarians act out their natural tendencies, but that people who don't share those views are more willing to go along with the authoritarian agenda."</p><p>	As an example, Pettigrew cited recent public-opinion polls that found that 60 percent of Israelis support abandoning Israeli settlements on the West Bank, yet the Israeli government refuses to budge from its hard-line support of the settlements.</p><p>	"The effects of government leadership lead to more discrimination and prejudice," said Pettigrew. </p><p>	Despite real and visible progress in race relations, Pettigrew bemoans the economic suffering of many blacks in this country. "Every time I see a black man or woman on television giving the news, I like that," said Pettigrew. "Fifty years ago, you'd never see that. The civil rights movement didn't fail. It was successful for the top third of blacks in this country."</p><p>	By contrast, though, life hasn't changed much for blacks in the ghettoes of major cities, according to Pettigrew. Only after many years of economic prosperity under Bill Clinton did the labor market become tight enough that private industry found it worthwhile to train unskilled blacks, he said. "It was remarkable--crime started going down, teen pregnancies declined," said Pettigrew. "The economic boon of the '90s finally reached the depths of the ghetto, and it was beginning to pay off."</p><p>	Whether those gains will hold during this economic downturn is unclear, noted Pettigrew. </p><p>	As one of the nation's leading social psychologists, Pettigrew laments the lack of impact on policy he and his colleagues have had over the past 30 years. </p><p>	Many of the underlying assumptions about human behavior embedded in government policy are "demonstrably wrong," he said, citing economists' mistaken assertion that humans act rationally and the stereotype that welfare recipients are lazy that fueled the 1994 federal welfare reform effort. "Almost nobody challenged those assumptions, that's what got me," he said.</p><p>	Pettigrew earned his Ph.D. from Harvard and taught at the University of North Carolina and Harvard before coming to UCSC in 1979. He retired from teaching in 1994 yet remains an active researcher and was recently appointed a senior fellow at Stanford University's Research Institute for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.  </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: To reach Thomas Pettigrew, please contact Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4399 or via e-mail at jmcnulty@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c67e48072704601a012ff2660e1ca"><name>245</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enjoy fine dining and benefit the UCSC Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden on November 12</title><author>Martha Brown (831) 459-3376; mtbrown@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Farm and Garden, Farm &amp; Garden</keywords><start-date>1035874800000</start-date><display-name>Enjoy fine dining and...</display-name><path>/2002/10/245</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/10/245</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337957809</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337957809</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-3376</phone><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Start your holiday feasting early and support a great cause on Tuesday, November 12, as chefs Robert Morris of Blacks Beach Cafe, and Heidi Schlecht and Amy Linstrom of Feel Good Foods organic seasonal catering, host a five-course dinner to benefit the Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden. Wine to accompany each course is being donated by Bonny Doon Vineyard.</p>

She has created works for dance, film, circus, television, theater, animation, and even half-time for the San Francisco 49ers! But when she heard last summer that a public school in her community was facing major funding cuts for its arts programs, Beal responded with an innovative teaching program.</p>
<p>A theater arts instructor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Beal called Sue Forson, principal and co-founder of Watsonville Charter School of the Arts, a predominately Latino school located about 25 miles south of the campus. She offered to mentor her UC students to go into all of the charter school's classes with lesson plans about art that were connected to the curriculum. The students would come from Beal's UCSC class titled "Art, Education &amp; the Community."</p>
<p>"Tandy is a master teacher and she provides solid support," said Forson. My arts funding was severely reduced. This costs my school nothing. It's a gift."</p>
<p>Beal's' program is unique in that she sends her UC students into the classroom in teams of three to five people. They work with each teacher's curriculum and come up with their own creative lesson plans in subjects such as science, literature and social studies.</p>
<p>"All my teachers really enjoy the infusion of energy and richness that the UCSC students bring," Forson noted. "And it's not just an imposition on their day. It's taking what the teachers need to cover--state standards--and adding an enrichment component. It's directly related to the content they're covering anyway. I really think it's fabulous."</p>
<p>In her UCSC class, Beal models different ways to approach classes for children. Her students read articles and spend a great deal of time practicing teaching techniques and getting feedback from each other.</p>
<p>"College students have enormous passion," Beal noted. "If you can help them use that passion and love of the arts and give them an opportunity to see they can make a difference in the community.well, that's what my best teaching is about. If people know they can make a difference at a young age, the whole trajectory of their lives can change."</p>
<p>Movement exercises are being used to motivate public school students who may be reluctant to participate in creative projects. Lessons on beat and rhythm, and dance games are helping elementary students memorize science facts about bats, or retain information about plate tectonics and movement of the earth. Younger children are making mobiles of their family members, or sock puppets of the person who cares for them, to help them visually represent their feelings.</p>
<p>"Even though most of us in the class at UCSC are artists, we're not learning to become art teachers, explained 19-year-old Rebecca Wolfe, an undeclared sophomore major. "We're here to give these kids a sense of community through the arts and give them skills, as well as teach them respect and a sense of responsibility. We're using the arts as a tool to learn and have fun."As students at UCSC, it's a huge learning opportunity for us," added Seth Weiner a 21-year-old community studies junior. "We learn just as much--if not more--than the kids we teach. This is a prime example of experiential learning which I really believe in."</p>
<p>Beal has spent nearly 30 years focusing on the relationship between art and community--ever since she became one of the first funded instructors to teach dance in the public schools in 1968.</p>
<p>"Our UC students are learning from the classroom students and the classroom teachers," Beal said. "They are bringing in their zest and appetite for the arts, but not much experience teaching. The children benefit, while the UC students are able to put the theory they have learned into real-life practice. My hope is that some of them will choose to become teachers after this."</p>
<p>Beal is working on having older students from the Watsonville school come to campus in the future to see what university life is like. "This age can be crucial for students in deciding whether to commit to school 100 percent or become a slacker," she added. "It may plant some seeds that may make a real difference in a kid's life."</p>
