<p>That's the message of the new book Learning for the 21st Century (Oxford, U.K.: Blackwell Publishers Ltd., 2002), edited by Gordon Wells, professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Guy Claxton, visiting professor of learning science at the University of Bristol in England.</p>
<p>"In stable times, tradition is an adequate guide, but these turbulent times call for a radical revision of education," said Wells. "We must look to the society of the future to determine what today's young people will need, and we must tap the depths of what we know about the human mind, about learning and development, to reevaluate the means and ends of education to meet those needs."</p>
<p>In today's "knowledge economy," it is no longer sufficient to follow the path of educators who have relied for years on a "top-down" approach to transmitting knowledge by lecturing. Rather, Wells and Claxton assert, the approach to curriculum must be revised to engage teachers and students in joint activities that enrich and educate both parties.</p>
<p>"Whenever two people work together, there is the potential for each to learn from and teach the other," said Wells. "The way human beings develop identity and knowledge is through joint activity, not as self-contained individuals."</p>
<p>In addition to emphasizing collaborative learning, Wells and Claxton assert that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Education should be responsive to the communities in which learners are growing up; curricula should build on the language, culture, socioeconomic background, experience, and knowledge of participants;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Language, especially the spoken word, is the medium through which most powerful learning takes place; the traditional classroom emphasis on textbooks and written assignments discounts this valuable medium as a tool of learning;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Teachers, steeped in an understanding of educational theory, must seek the support of parents and administrators and take up the challenge of adjusting the way they teach by involving students in their curriculum planning and focusing on the interests, needs, and strengths of their students.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Teachers will need to explain this approach to parents, and it will require a good dose of courage because they will face challenges from those who believe learning only takes place when the teacher is talking or students are writing," said Wells. "And it requires a different kind of mental preparation--it's much more like improvisation than acting with a script. They must be prepared to make mistakes and to learn from them, and encourage their students to do the same."</p>
<p>Transforming classrooms into forums for collaboration will help prepare today's students for the uncertain demands of the future while building a sense of community based on their own experience of participation.</p>
<p>"Education, at this point in our history, is really about the development of a mind to learn," said Wells. "We strongly disagree with the current drive toward predetermined outcomes and one-size-fits-all learning."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the challenges of promoting his ideas in an era of standards and accountability, Wells said he takes satisfaction from his work helping to prepare the next generation of teachers. "Education at the state and federal level was co-opted more than 100 years ago by those who see it as a way of producing an adequately equipped, subservient workforce at the expense of fostering diversity of talent and creativity," he said. "It is based on a system of direction, control, and accountability. Fortunately for students, well-prepared teachers can do much more, and individual schools and districts can be receptive to more contemporary visions of what is possible."</p>

It's September in Santa Cruz, which means it's time to enjoy one of the great privileges of life on the Central Coast: As gardeners around the country are bracing for winter, their counterparts here are looking forward to the bounty of another productive growing season.</p>
<p>Warm fall days and mild winters make year-round gardening a reality on the Central Coast. And as surely as September ushers in warm days, the UCSC Fall Plant Sale offers gardeners a rich and timely selection of certified organic vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Farm at the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale takes place on Friday and Saturday, September 13 and 14, from noon to 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Leeks, rainbow chards, salad greens, and Brassicas like broccoli and kale are just a few of the vegetables that can be planted this fall for winter harvest. Autumn is also the best time to plant perennial shrubs, and California natives, according to UCSC Garden Manager Christof Bernau. In addition to winter vegetables, the sale will feature perennial flowers and shrubs, including culinary herbs, subtropical salvias, herbaceous perennials like yarrow and Lady's Mantle, and a limited selection of California natives and roses.</p>
<p>"Because the soil is still warm, transplants quickly establish strong roots that ensure their survival during the winter," said Bernau. "Fall and winter rains ease the task of watering new plantings and provide a huge jump on establishment so plants will be in good shape as the days get longer, soil temperatures increase, and the soils begin to dry the following spring." Fall plantings will be much larger and have more bloom than those planted in spring, he added.</p>
<p>The sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale.

For Arboretum and CNPS members only, the sale starts at 10 a.m. It will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove, on High Street at the intersection with Western Drive. </p><p>For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an excellent time to get new plants established. The Arboretum offers a wide range of plant selections, including California natives and drought-tolerant plants from Australia and South Africa. </p><p>This year's sale will include some new Australian plants introduced by the Koala Blooms partnership. This plant introduction program is structured to return some of the profits to the Australian nurseries that developed the plants and some to the Arboretum, which has imported the plants, grown them in trials, and distributed them to nurseries. At least two new introductions, described below, will be available at this year's sale.</p><p>Chorizema 'Bush Flame' is an evergreen plant with arching to semierect sprays of brilliant orange and pink pea flowers from fall through early spring. It has bright-green, heart-shaped leaves and grows to about 3 feet.

Students are scheduled to move into university housing between Thursday, September 12, and Sunday, September 15. (See schedule, below, for photo opportunities.)</p>
<p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, UCSC's newest college, new academic programs the campus is offering, and what the campus is doing to house students:</p>
<p><strong>UCSC's Newest College Opens:</strong></p>
<p>College Ten--home to 407 students, including 260 freshmen--is opening this fall. UCSC's newest college has an intellectual theme of "social justice and community" and is affiliated with the Division of Social Sciences. But Campbell Leaper, provost of the new college, says College Ten students "come from all majors, including those in humanities, arts, natural sciences, and engineering, as well as social sciences."</p>
<p>The new college's core course, Social Justice and Community: A Writing and Discussion Seminar, will examine current issues related to the college theme. Topics may include poverty, discrimination, immigration, human rights, and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>The college's residence halls are also opening, and students who live there will share a new dining hall with students living in the new College Nine residence halls (see "Housing UCSC Students" section, below).</p>

<p>For more information, please go to: <a href="http://collegeten.ucsc.edu/">http://collegeten.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</strong></p>
<p>o Anthropology has added new B.A. concentrations in archaeology, cultural anthropology, and physical anthropology.</p>
<p>o The Baskin School of Engineering is offering new M.S. and Ph.D. programs in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>o In Biological Sciences, there is a new M.A. concentration in ecology, evolution, and behavior.</p>
<p>o Education is offering a new Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>o Language Studies is adding a new B.A. concentration and minor concentration in Ancient Greek, and a new B.A. concentration and minor concentration in Latin.</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment:</strong></p>
<p>UCSC is expecting an opening-day enrollment of approximately 14,250 students. Enrollment totals become official following the third week of instruction.</p>

<p>Of the 14,250 students, approximately 13,000 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,250 are expected to enroll in graduate studies.</p>

<p>Of the 13,000 undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately 4,250 will be new students (3,250 freshmen and 1,000 transfer students).</p>

<p>The 1,000 transfer students, most of whom are coming from the California Community College system, represent a 5 percent increase over last year's incoming transfer students.</p>

<p>These 4,250 new undergraduates were admitted from among 25,425 applicants, a record number for undergraduate admission.</p>
<p><strong>Profile of New Freshmen:</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 3,250 of the 4,250 new undergraduates expected will be freshmen, an 8 percent increase over 2001-02.</p>

<p>Of the total number of freshmen expected, a total of 1,276 identified themselves as either African American, American Indian, Asian/Asian American, Chicano, or Latino; of the freshmen enrolled last fall, a total of 1,090 were from those ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the areas of biological sciences (252) and psychology (167). The Jack Baskin School of Engineering, beginning its sixth fall, attracted 232 freshmen who declared in the following majors: Computer Science (111), Computer Engineering (65), Electrical Engineering (28), Information Systems Management (15), and Bioinformatics (13).</p>

<p>Among the freshmen expected to enroll at UCSC this fall are 26 Regents Scholars. Among the most academically accomplished high school graduates, these students will receive UC's most prestigious scholarship, which covers all university fees for four years. This year's freshmen who are Regents Scholars have an average grade-point average of 4.16, average SAT I scores of 1422, and average SAT II scores of 1448. Five other new students, transferring to UCSC this fall, qualified for the same scholarship; they had an average GPA of 4.0. Among new and continuing students, UCSC's student body now includes 186 Regents Scholars.</p>
<p><strong>Housing UCSC Students:</strong></p>
<p>UCSC has increased the capacity of its university-sponsored housing by 854 bed spaces since fall of 2001--from 5,363 to 6,217 this fall.</p>

<p>Residence halls at Colleges Nine and Ten are opening this fall for the first time, providing new on-campus housing for 820 students (College Nine, 407; College Ten, 413). (This year is the third that the apartments at College Nine will be occupied. That housing is providing accommodations for 305 students.)</p>

<p>Included in the total of university-sponsored housing are accommodations for 153 students in the Village, comprised of 17 modular units located in the campus's Lower Quarry; and for 199 students at UCSC Inn &amp; Conference Center (the former Holiday Inn) on Ocean Street near downtown Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>UCSC's total housing capacity also includes 80 students who will occupy 54 apartments in the University Town Center on Pacific Avenue. (An additional 26 bed spaces in the center are reserved for UCSC Extension students enrolled in the English Language International Program.)</p>

<p>In addition to the 6,217 university-sponsored bed spaces, UCSC accommodations include 197 units at the Family Student Housing complex on the west side of campus and 42 spaces in the campus's RV Park.</p>

<p>In all, the campus will be housing approximately 45 percent of its student body, the highest percentage of any UC campus.</p>

<p>In addition to students who will reside in housing described above, UCSC has secured approximately 100 rooms in 8 local motels participating in the Slug Housing Partnership Program. In its sixth year, this program links students with local motels, which rent rooms to students on a monthly basis during the academic year (when there is less tourist demand for rooms).</p>

<p>UCSC is continuing to build housing for students this year. Apartment-style buildings will be added at Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter Colleges for an overall total of 652 new bed spaces. Occupancy is planned for fall 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong></p>
<p>UCSC administrators are available for phone or in-person interviews to discuss the campus's first-day enrollment projections, the entering class, and other "back-to-school" subjects.</p>

<p>To schedule an interview, please call UCSC's Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495 (weekdays, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.).</p>

Before coming to UCSC, Barnett was director of software and copyright ventures at the University of Washington, where he developed one of the leading university programs for software and information product management in the United States. </p><p>The management of intellectual property is an increasingly important issue for research universities, said Robert Miller, vice chancellor for research at UCSC, who spearheaded the creation of the new office. </p><p>"We are thrilled to have Gerald Barnett come here to establish a new office designed to help faculty, students, and staff manage appropriately the intellectual property arising out of their scholarly activities," Miller said. "UCSC is now in a position to deploy information, data, software, copyright-based materials, and patented technologies in the public interest. We are also in a position to establish enhanced relationships with public and private corporations. Enhanced activity in this arena demands professional expertise to deal with the wide complexities of intellectual property management." </p><p>Intellectual property (IP) refers to certain intangible assets protected by law--mainly patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as some kinds of technical information (i.e., "trade secrets"). Intellectual property from research and other creative activities at UCSC has the potential to grow significantly in the next three years with the expansion of the Baskin School of Engineering and other initiatives, Barnett said.</p><p>"Our aim is to use these rights of innovation to create productive relationships for the university," he said. "IP management is all too often construed as finding things of commercial value and licensing them for money. That is one element of IP management, but it shouldn't come to dominate. More broadly, IP management is about how a university interacts with the community."</p><p>Barnett will work with UC's systemwide Office of Technology Transfer on the licensing of patents and inventions for commercial use. This can result in income for the campus if the license leads to a product that generates royalties. </p><p>"That's a rare occurrence, but we'd like it to happen," Barnett said. </p><p>Intellectual property issues arise in the arts and humanities as well as in science and engineering. The use of digital media in the arts, the fair use of copyrighted materials, and even the simple publication of a manuscript are all areas where expertise in intellectual property management can be helpful, he said.</p><p>Barnett brings a unique background to his position. He earned a B.S. degree in mathematics and physics from Walla Walla College in Washington, and stayed there for another year to earn a B.A. degree in English. He then went on to the University of Washington (UW), where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in English literature. As a graduate assistant, Barnett helped start UW's Humanities and Arts Computing Center, where he provided project development advice and computer programming support. </p><p>Barnett later joined the intellectual property and technology transfer office at UW, with lead responsibility for innovations involving software and digital media. There he worked with Miller, who was UW's vice provost for intellectual property and technology transfer before coming to UCSC. </p><p>"At UW, Barnett became, in my opinion, the premier software licensing and copyright officer in the U.S. in a university environment," Miller said. "He developed new strategies for licensing software and copyrighted materials, and those licenses have generated a lot of revenue for the university and for the support of research." </p><p>Intellectual property issues can be especially complex in the area of computer software and other kinds of "information products," such as databases and web sites, Barnett said. Such products tend to have multiple forms of intellectual property associated with them, and university policies often treat these different forms of intellectual property differently. </p><p>"You may have patents, copyrights, web domain names, and trade secrets all at once for a simple piece of software code that you just want to give away. So for a software package you might have to bring together people who have different ownership interests and work out an agreement," Barnett said. </p><p>The other element that makes software a tricky area for IP management is the culture of sharing among software developers, which has led to the "open source" movement that promotes the free distribution of the primary source codes for software programs. </p><p>"Intellectual property tends to be managed in a way that cuts across this culture of sharing and places ownership questions where people would rather not have them, so you have to be careful not to interfere with these exchanges, but rather to try to augment or preserve them," Barnett said. "Some people see an inherent conflict between the public interest and intellectual property. But there are some good management protocols that may actually help keep software exchanges open. I think we can use intellectual property to accomplish things that the faculty desire, and do it in a way that benefits both the university and the public interest."</p><p>Barnett said research universities have a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate how new protocols for IP management can contribute to the deployment of and investment in innovation. A central concept, he said, is the idea of a "technology commons," where information and technology are exchanged freely, while commercial interests are asked not only to respect the exchange but also to support it with financial or in-kind contributions. </p><p>"I'm interested in seeing enterprise develop around university innovation, including service companies, nonprofit advocacy organizations, and for-profit initiatives to develop new products," Barnett said. "Research universities such as UCSC are recognizing the responsibilities that come with public funding for technology-based research, and are participating in the effort to bring innovation into community use."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Barnett at (831) 459-5415 or gbarnett@cats.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c44628072704601a012ffdd707a5e"><name>199</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz receives $9.1 million grant to establish a Laboratory for Adaptive Optics to develop new tools for astronomers</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>adaptive optics, Moore Foundation</keywords><start-date>1032332400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz receives...</display-name><path>/2002/09/199</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/199</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337948699</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337948699</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a grant of $9.1 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to establish a Laboratory for Adaptive Optics. The new laboratory strengthens UCSC's position as an astronomy powerhouse and a national center for research on the exciting new technology of adaptive optics. The grant is the largest contribution from a private foundation in the history of UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics will develop innovative instrumentation for the application of adaptive optics technology in astronomy. Adaptive optics sharpen the vision of ground-based telescopes by removing the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. </p><p>The new laboratory complements the Center for Adaptive Optics, headquartered at UCSC and established in 1999 with a $20 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The center focuses on the advancement of adaptive optics technology in astronomy and vision science. The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics will be administered by UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), which already oversees a set of world-class technical facilities for astronomical instrumentation on the UCSC campus, including an optical lab and shops, an engineering lab, and an advanced detector lab.</p><p>"This grant builds on UCSC's existing strengths in astronomy, astronomical instrumentation, and adaptive optics, and we are extremely grateful to the Moore Foundation for their very generous support of this important work," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.</p><p>The new grant will help establish the campus as the leading institution in the world for research in adaptive optics, Greenwood said. As the home campus for UCO/Lick, UCSC has long been prominent in the field of astronomy. Its Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics has been ranked number one in the country for the impact of its faculty's research in the field of astrophysics. </p><p>"UC Santa Cruz is a superb location for the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics, which will play a major role in the future of astronomy and other fields where high-quality images are important," said Ed Penhoet, senior director of science and education at the Moore Foundation.</p><p>The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics will enable researchers to develop prototypes of advanced adaptive optics equipment and concepts and test them in a controlled laboratory setting. It will also serve as a training facility where researchers and students can gain experience with adaptive optics equipment. It will be the first such comprehensive university laboratory dedicated to adaptive optics in the United States, said Joseph Miller, director of UCO/Lick. </p><p>"In many ways, adaptive optics is still in its infancy, and the potential is great for the development of powerful new equipment and techniques. A laboratory like this is important for furthering the development of this technology," Miller said. </p><p>The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics will serve as a testing facility for ideas and concepts developed at the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), which does not have laboratories or experimental facilities directly associated with it at UCSC, said Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and an associate director of CfAO. Max is the lead scientist on the Moore Foundation grant; Miller and CfAO director Jerry Nelson are coprincipal investigators.</p><p>"The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics gives UCSC and UCO/Lick an entirely new capability that will be the foundation for many future projects and significant advances in adaptive optics systems," Max said.</p><p>The laboratory will focus initially on developing equipment for two cutting-edge concepts in adaptive optics: extreme adaptive optics and multi-conjugate adaptive optics. Extreme adaptive optics promises to give astronomers the ability to directly detect and study planets around other stars far beyond our own solar system. More than 80 of these "extrasolar" planets have been detected in recent years by indirect measurements of the gravitational effects the planets have on their parent stars. Direct imaging of such planets would enable astronomers to learn more about their properties and perhaps even to detect signs of life.</p><p>Multi-conjugate adaptive optics involves making multiple corrections to account for the effects of turbulence at different levels in the atmosphere. It also enables the adaptive optics system to correct for the effects of turbulence over a much larger area of the sky. Multi-conjugate adaptive optics will be essential for the extremely large telescopes astronomers plan to build in the near future. According to Max, however, considerable advances over existing technology are needed to put the theory of multi-conjugate adaptive optics into practice.</p><p>The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics will enable researchers to build and test prototype equipment for both extreme adaptive optics and multi-conjugate adaptive optics, Max said.</p><p>"We will be able to test new components and new algorithms under controlled conditions, and compare different ways of optimizing the performance of adaptive optics systems," she said. "One of the problems with testing equipment on a telescope is that you never know exactly what the atmosphere was doing during your test, whereas in the lab you can impose a known mock-up of what the atmosphere might do."</p><p>Miller said he expects the new laboratory to be up and running within a year. Several options are under consideration for the lab's location, including sites adjacent to the existing UCO/Lick optical labs.</p><p>"I am overjoyed that UC Santa Cruz has been awarded this sensational gift," commented Marion Cope, chair of the Development Committee for the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. "I have watched this young campus attain national and international recognition for its outstanding research. Support from private sources is crucial to maintain this upward trajectory. Many thanks to the Moore Foundation."</p><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is a private, family, grant-making institution dedicated to the improvement of the quality of life through education, science, and conservation. The Foundation emphasizes grant outcomes that affect future generations. Established by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and his wife, Betty, the foundation funds projects in four program areas: higher education, scientific research, the environment, and selected San Francisco Bay Area projects. The foundation began operations in late 2000 and is headquartered in San Francisco.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Miller at (831) 459-2991 or miller@ucolick.org, and Max at (831) 459-2049 or max@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c46148072704601a012ffc45b2c96"><name>200</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rockefeller Foundation gives UC Santa Cruz $325,000 humanities award</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>humanities, cultural studies, rockefeller</keywords><start-date>1032246000000</start-date><display-name>Rockefeller Foundation gives UC...</display-name><path>/2002/09/200</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/200</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337949118</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337949118</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Rockefeller Foundation has awarded a $325,000 Humanities Fellowship to the University of California, Santa Cruz. "This Humanities Fellowship is a very competitive program," said Lynn A. Szwaja, deputy director of creativity and culture at the Rockefeller Foundation. "This year we received 46 applications and gave eight awards." </p><p>The UC Santa Cruz award supports a three-year program of visiting scholars, small public conferences, and workshops focused on contemporary and historic globalization issues. The new program, "Other Globalizations: Histories, Trans-Regionalism, and Cultural Formations," will be based at the campus's Center for Cultural Studies.</p><p>"The Rockefeller Foundation has dealt with global studies for years," said Szwaja. "The terrorists' attacks of September 11 made us feel our work was more relevant than ever, and that it's important to continue funding humanistic studies, and keep the flow of ideas coming."</p><p>This is the second Rockefeller grant earned by the Center for Cultural Studies, which was established in 1988 and has become widely known as an important location for globalization studies. Codirected by Gail Hershatter, professor of history, and Christopher Connery, associate professor of literature, the Center for Cultural Studies supports research, discussion, and events about cultural studies in a global framework. In addition to faculty from UCSC's Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts divisions, visiting scholars also participate in the center's activities and research.</p><p>"With the Rockefeller Foundation's support, the Center for Cultural Studies is particularly interested in developing links with scholarly communities, such as those in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Pacific, whose relations with U.S. universities are at an early stage," said Connery. Because the Rockefeller grant provides a $40,000 annual salary plus benefits for visiting scholars, applicants need not be dependent on support from their home institutions. </p><p>"We're hoping to attract scholars working in new areas of research, who can bring perspectives from the humanities disciplines to the study of globalization," said Hershatter. "Without a sense of history, cultural variation, or philosophical depth, discussions of globalization are apt to be superficial and incomplete."</p><p>For more information on the "Other Globalizations: Histories, Trans-Regionalism, and Cultural Formations," see the Center for Cultural Studies web site, <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/CultStudies/">http://humwww.ucsc.edu/CultStudies/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c474b8072704601a012ffd71014e3"><name>201</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor travels country on teaching 'gig'</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>humanities, Berger, Phi Beta Kappa</keywords><start-date>1031554800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor...</display-name><path>/2002/09/201</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/201</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337949460</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337949460</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For a man who jokes that he's "out to pasture," Harry Berger Jr. maintains a teaching and travel schedule that would fatigue a racehorse. The University of California, Santa Cruz, professor emeritus of literature and art history will be crisscrossing the country this year, teaching in two programs featuring distinguished scholars.</p><p>"I used to be a musician so I think of this as a gig, travelling around the country and trying some ideas out," said Berger, a former amateur jazz clarinetist who hasn't stopped researching, writing, publishing, delivering guest lectures, and teaching the occasional class since his retirement from UC Santa Cruz nearly a decade ago.</p><p>This month, Berger travels from Santa Cruz to Northampton, Mass., to be the Ruth and Clarence Kennedy Professor in Renaissance Studies at Smith College for the fall semester. During the winter and spring of 2003, he will be a Phi Beta Kappa visiting scholar, giving lectures at eight colleges and universities around the United States. In addition to the stops on his Visiting Scholar itinerary, he's squeezing in guest lectures at the University of Tennessee and Cornell University.</p><p>Berger started his journey in literature and art history at Yale University, where he earned his B.A. and Ph.D. in English and taught for nine years. "When I was in graduate school, I became fascinated by Edmund Spenser's 1,000-page poem, the Faerie Queene," said Berger. "That's how I got into it all."</p><p>Although much of Berger's initial scholarship was in Renaissance poetry, particularly Spenser's work, his research and interests quickly expanded. "I got into teaching all kinds of things at Yale: Dante, Plato, metaphysics," said Berger.</p><p>Berger came to UCSC as a founding faculty member in 1965. His wide-ranging and interdisciplinary approach was a good fit with UCSC's approach, where traditional academic boundaries were less evident, especially in the early years of the campus .</p><p>At UCSC Berger taught a variety of subjects under the general category of culture theory and Renaissance culture, including Renaissance drama and Shakespeare. He also published extensively. "Sometimes I have a sense of myself as sitting at a typing table and floating on a cloud for 50 years," said Berger, who has almost a dozen books and more than 80 articles to his credit. </p><p>In art history, Berger has a special interest in Italian and Dutch painting and the theory and practice of portraiture. "When you think about a portrait, it's someone striking a pose for the painter and whoever will see the portrait after it's finished," said Berger. "Are they trying to impress someone, the viewer, who is necessarily absent from the creation process? Maybe they are wondering how other people will experience their portrait. Thinking about this led me into my work on performance anxiety."</p><p>At Smith College, Berger will lead a colloquium called "Fictions of the Pose: Self-Representation in Portraits, Poems, and Plays," which will be a close study of performance and performance anxiety in painted portraits, lyric poems, and the Shakespearean soliloquy. The Kennedy Professorship in Renaissance Studies at Smith, established nearly 30 years ago, brings scholars to the campus to teach and deliver public lectures. </p><p>As a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar, Berger will travel to universities and colleges that have Phi Beta Kappa chapters, spending two days at each campus. During each visit he will informally meet with undergraduates, participate in classroom lectures and seminars, and give one major address open to the entire academic community. </p><p>Topics Berger is offering as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar include the unreliable narrators in Plato's Dialogues, Renaissance misogyny and masculine anxiety in Edmund Spenser's the Faerie Queene, and "realism" and performance anxiety in 17th-century Dutch painting.</p><p>"These are issues I've been working on, some of them for 40 years, and I've got some new ideas about them," said Berger. "It's time for me to go public and see what the reaction is."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c487d8072704601a012ff734f0afc"><name>202</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor awarded $1 million grant for innovative approach to undergraduate science education</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Ares, HHMI, Howard Hughes</keywords><start-date>1032332400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor...</display-name><path>/2002/09/202</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/202</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337949754</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1512686936345</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Manuel Ares, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will use a $1 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) to pursue an innovative approach to teaching science to undergraduate students. Ares wants to give more students the opportunity to learn in a real research environment. He is one of 20 scientists nationwide who have been appointed as HHMI Professors, with the goal of making science more engaging for undergraduates.</p>
<p>HHMI solicited proposals last year from 84 research universities, hoping to encourage fresh approaches to science education. The HHMI Professors program aims to change the culture of research universities, where teaching often tends to be valued less than research.</p>
<p>"We want to empower scientists at research universities to become more involved in breaking the mold and bringing the excitement of research to science education," said HHMI President Thomas R. Cech.</p>
<p>Ares will use the grant to create an undergraduate research laboratory in which students will learn by conducting research in genomics. The students will focus on certain features of the human genome and the genome of the malaria parasite.</p>
<p>"I want to make it a one-room schoolhouse for genomics, where students with different strengths will work together and learn from each other," Ares said. "I envision a laboratory where students have a set of research goals, state-of-the-art equipment, and access to experts who can provide appropriate guidance; but the research will be done by the students. The idea is to teach them how to operate in a research environment where they won't know the answers to everything, so they'll need to consult with others, read the literature, and conduct experiments."</p>
<p>The undergraduate research group will consist of 10 to 15 students at one time. New students will come in as the older ones graduate or leave the program, and probably 30 to 40 will participate over the four-year period of the grant. The students will be primarily juniors and seniors, with majors in various disciplines, including biology, bioinformatics, and computer science. In the course of their research, the students will learn essential concepts of genetics, molecular biology, protein structure and function, physiology, and evolution, Ares said. They will also learn about the applications of computer science and mathematics to problems in biology.</p>
<p>A special laboratory dedicated to the research group will be established, complete with sophisticated equipment and technology. The students will have their own set of interdisciplinary questions to address, but their work will be integrated with the rest of Ares's research laboratory.</p>
<p>"We'll have joint lab meetings, and the whole lab will be engaged in this," Ares said. "I'll probably spend a lot of time with the students, but they will also be interacting with my graduate students and postdocs, as well as with other faculty."</p>
<p>Ares said he hopes the experience will encourage students to think of themselves not only as scientists but as scientist-teachers. He also wants to engage students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.</p>
<p>"I'm particularly interested in attracting students who may not have seen themselves as scientists or science educators, and giving them the opportunity to see the possibilities for themselves in that area," he said.</p>
<p>In his proposal, Ares emphasized the close natural relationship between teaching and research. Teaching should be established as an integral part of research, in both formal and informal ways, he said.</p>
<p>"I think the key is to make self-learning, which is an intrinsically self-satisfying activity, connect more directly to teaching, which is an altruistic activity that generates satisfaction in the teacher indirectly through its effects on others," Ares wrote in his proposal. "Research is the act of teaching ourselves, and is accomplished using the same elements we should be using to teach others. I have found that the best teachers are also immersed in research and scholarly activity of their own design."</p>
<p>Ares noted that his own experience doing research as an undergraduate was a critical factor leading to his career as a university scientist and teacher. His long-term goal for the project, which he hopes to continue after the end of the grant period, is to help establish a new generation of faculty who are committed to the value of integrated research and teaching.</p>
<p>"The thing I'll most enjoy is if I find someone who hasn't recognized that potential in themselves, who gets engaged and turns out to be a really good scientist and teacher," he said.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c4a0d8072704601a012ff24bbbadc"><name>203</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz experts available to comment on 'Banned Books Week'</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>banned books</keywords><start-date>1032332400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz experts...</display-name><path>/2002/09/203</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/203</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337950148</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337950148</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This year's national Banned Books Week, September 22-28, takes on a heightened importance as Americans debate how to balance national security issues and First Amendment rights.

If you have trouble reaching any of them, contact Ann Gibb, (831) 459-2496 or anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Forrest Robinson, professor of American studies, has written and taught on Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn, one of the most read and frequently banned American novels since its publication in 1884. "Beginning in the 20th century, Huckleberry Finn has been periodically banned on the grounds of racial insensitivity," said Robinson. "But in the last 15 years, groups of parents have gotten together to talk with teachers and work out criteria so that Huckleberry Finn can be taught in a way that is racially sensitive. This book is part of a vital and enduring feature of American culture, so the idea of banishment is absurd, but it needs to be presented to young people with sensitivity and historical context." Robinson can be reached at (831) 427-0414 or robinson@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Jody Greene, assistant professor of literature and women's studies, has written and taught on the history of copyright law and the relationship between ownership of content and liability, the history of literacy, and the history of the book. "I think Americans are more intellectually resilient than both the right and the left give us credit for," said Greene. "When we're confronted by things we disagree with, we begin to figure out what we believe. Taking away choice, or having a few people control choice, is no guarantee of ultimately producing ethical behavior." Greene can be reached at (831) 459-5457 or jgreene@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Carla Freccero, professor of literature and women's studies, has written on the attempt to censor the novel American Psycho, by Bret Easton Ellis. Ellis's original publisher withdrew its contract offer after prepublication reviews denounced the novel. "We see more and more self-censorship in America," said Freccero, "especially during times of war. This is not external controls by the government, but internal fears of offending, or business fears that a book or film might not make money. But what good will it do to only say one thing about an event?"

To help meet the demand for fishery scientists with expertise in the quantitative assessment of fish populations, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Santa Cruz Laboratory have formed a new partnership called the Center for Stock Assessment Research (CSTAR).</p><p>CSTAR is funded by NMFS to support UCSC students (both undergraduates and graduate students) and postdoctoral researchers working in the areas of quantitative fish population dynamics and fishery stock assessment. The program is part of a nationwide effort by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the fisheries service, to address the need for more scientists with this kind of training, said Churchill Grimes, director of the NMFS Santa Cruz Laboratory. </p><p>In addition to training scientists, CSTAR supports research on advanced stock assessment methods, said Marc Mangel, a professor of applied math and statistics at UCSC, who heads the CSTAR program together with NMFS fishery biologist Alec MacCall.</p><p>"We need a better understanding of the dynamics of fish populations to do a better job of managing them," Mangel said. "NMFS is charged with doing the analyses to provide a scientific basis for managing fisheries, and our job in CSTAR is to train people who can do those analyses and to develop new methods that can be applied to the problems of fisheries management."  </p><p>The NMFS Santa Cruz Lab is responsible for assessments of West Coast salmon and groundfish populations. Groundfish include flatfish such as halibut, roundfish such as lingcod, many different species of rockfish (usually marketed as red snapper), bottom-dwelling sharks and skates, and several other species. As part of their training, UCSC students and postdocs in the CSTAR program work with NMFS scientists on ongoing stock assessments. </p><p>"In doing stock assessments, the idea is to bring in as many kinds of information as you can to assess the health of the stock, including numbers of fish, age distribution, sex distribution, and size distribution, because all of those factors affect the population dynamics and determine how the stock will respond to fishing pressure," Mangel said.</p><p>The Pacific Fishery Management Council has imposed progressively tighter restrictions on the groundfish fishery over the past five years to allow certain populations to recover from overfishing. These restrictions are having serious economic impacts, which might have been avoided if scientists had understood the fishery 20 years ago as well as they do now, MacCall said. </p><p>"We are facing a crisis here on the West Coast that is comparable to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1940s and '50s," MacCall said. "The only hope for avoiding this kind of disaster in the future is to have really talented people on the job keeping track of things. It all hinges on our ability to determine how many fish are out there and how much is safe to catch on a sustainable basis."</p><p>Many species of groundfish are very long-lived and slow to reproduce, which means that rebuilding their populations will take decades, and in some cases centuries. The estimated recovery time for yelloweye rockfish in northern California, for example, is 208 years.</p><p>"Chances are we won't see a healthy groundfish fishery on the West Coast in our lifetimes," MacCall said. "Some of these species live up to 150 years, so their whole life strategy as a fish is to be in it for the long haul. Unfortunately, it took us 20 years to finally be able to do the analyses to say, oops, we've gone too far. That kind of analysis is what CSTAR is now training people to do."</p><p>Nine UCSC students and postdocs are currently members of CSTAR, including Michael Bonsall, a visiting research fellow studying speciation and the evolution of longevity in rockfish; Teresa Ish, a graduate student in ocean sciences doing research on the squid fishery, California's largest fishery in terms of volume landed and commercial value; Andi Stephens, a graduate student in ocean sciences looking at the ecological effects of Atlantic salmon that escape from aquaculture ("fish farms") on the West Coast; and Kate Siegfried, an environmental studies graduate student studying the life histories of sharks.</p><p>CSTAR gives students a rare opportunity to tackle real-world problems in an academic setting, Mangel said.</p><p>"I think the current generation of students, more than any generation that has preceded them, really want to do useful things--they want to solve problems," Mangel said. "With CSTAR, they have the ability to work on important problems at an academically rigorous level, so they can leave here with the training they need to make the kind of contribution they want to make."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Mangel at (831) 234-2970 or msmangel@ams.ucsc.edu, and MacCall at (831) 420-3950 or alec.maccall@noaa.gov.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c4f808072704601a012ff894db394"><name>207</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oct.12 Harvest Festival celebrates 35 years of UCSC leadership in organic farming and gardening</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Farm, Farm &amp; Garden, Harvest Festival</keywords><start-date>1032937200000</start-date><display-name>Oct.12 Harvest Festival celebrates...</display-name><path>/2002/09/207</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/09/207</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337951554</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337951554</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The annual Harvest Festival at the UC Santa Cruz Farm draws hundreds of families who gather to enjoy music, good food, and the changing of the seasons. This year's event on Saturday, October 12, will be especially festive as the Farm celebrates 35 years of leadership in organic farming and gardening.</p>
<p>Highlights of this year's festival include a bigger-than-ever apple tasting, performances by three bands, an apple pie bake-off, workshops, tours, and all the fun activities kids have come to expect, including face painting, hayrides, pumpkin decorating, and fresh-squeezed apple juice tasting (see full schedule of events below). Delectable edibles will keep you going all afternoon. The Harvest Festival takes place at the UCSC Farm from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. General admission is $5; UCSC students (with ID) are $3. Admission is free for children ages 12 and under and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available in designated areas. For more information, call (831) 459-3240. For directions, call (831) 459-4140 or see www.ucsc.edu/casfs. The festival is cosponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems. Funds raised at the Harvest Festival support the scholarship and public education work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Major business sponsors of the Harvest Festival are Stonyfield Yogurt, Odwalla, Christiansen Associates Gardens &amp; Design, New Leaf Community Markets, and Straus Communications.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people have participated in the Farm's pioneering apprenticeship in organic horticulture, and many have gone on to become leaders in the field--literally and figuratively--of sustainable agriculture. Profiles of several graduates follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the southside of Birmingham, Alabama, Page Allison and Edwin Marty, who completed the apprenticeship in 2000, have transformed a one-acre vacant lot adjacent to office buildings and the Southtown public housing community into Jones Valley Urban Farm, where children and adults grow organic produce and flowers while learning about food and farming. Residents of the local YMCA are involved in work and job training at the farm, and goods are sold at the local farmer's market, as well as to restaurants and specialty stores. Allison and Marty see their "urban greening" endeavor as a way to inspire pride in the city and a greater appreciation of natural resources.<br/>

<li>As certification manager for California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), Brian McElroy has overseen the rapid growth of one of the leading certification organizations in the United States. CCOF now works with 1,100 producers, and 145,000 acres are in the certification program, up from 50,000 acres when McElroy joined in 1994. McElroy, who completed the apprenticeship in 1994, is active in the international organic community, having served four years on the standards committee of the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM), which has developed the worldwide definition of organic for everything from field production techniques to the processing of packaged goods that are distributed around the world.<br/>

Now researchers from a variety of disciplines want to deploy a new kind of drilling system that will enable them to recover a broader range of samples and data from beneath the polar ice.</p>

<p>In a workshop next week at the University of California, Santa Cruz, an interdisciplinary group of scientists will explore the possibilities for a fast, mobile drilling system to study what lies beneath the massive Antarctic ice sheets. The workshop, "Interdisciplinary polar research based on fast ice-sheet drilling (FASTDRILL)," will take place October 4-6. It will bring together about 50 polar scientists studying Antarctic geology and history, ice-sheet dynamics, life in subglacial lakes, and related topics. NASA scientists who want to use Antarctica as a testing ground for future explorations of ice on Mars and Europa will also attend the workshop.</p>
<p>Almost all of the polar drilling done so far has used stationary drill rigs that stay in the same place for years to recover a series of ice cores. With recent advances in drilling technology, however, a more versatile drill rig should be feasible, said workshop organizer Slawek Tulaczyk, an assistant professor of Earth sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>"With a fast and mobile drilling system, we hope to get access to all of the scientific mysteries hidden beneath a couple of miles of ice," Tulaczyk said. "The new drill rig would open a whole new world of scientific opportunities for penetration of subglacial environments and for subglacial sampling of rocks and lakes."</p>
<p>Scientists would like to use the new system to study the geology of the land beneath the ice; to investigate conditions at the base of ice streams and their effects on the movement of the ice; to measure geothermal heat flow beneath the ice; to detect life in subglacial lakes and deep ice; and to pursue a variety of other applications.</p>
<p>"There are promising technologies for doing this--our engineering colleagues tell us there probably are not technological barriers. But it hasn't been done before, so one objective of the workshop is to match scientists' needs and expectations with the existing technology," Tulaczyk said.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers interested in polar biology, geology, geophysics, glaciology, paleoclimatology, ice-drilling technology, exobiology, and other related disciplines will participate in the workshop. The director of the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, Karl Erb, is also expected to attend.</p>
<p>Scientists studying ice dynamics and glaciology are especially interested in looking at the processes at the base of the ice streams, vast rivers of ice that flow through the ice sheets. Tulaczyk, a glaciologist, would like to investigate an area known as the grounding line, where the ice sheets come in contact with the ocean, extending out over the water as floating ice shelves. The melting rates at the interface between the ice sheets and the ocean are surprisingly high, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a mystery to us how the ice could be melting so fast, and it's important to understand because this could be a mechanism for very rapid changes in the ice sheet, particularly if global warming increases ocean temperature in the near future," Tulaczyk said.</p>
<p>For geologists, the new drilling system would enable regional sampling of the rocks beneath the ice. Only about 2 percent of Antarctica is free of ice, and many key questions about the continent's geology remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Biologists have also become interested in what may lie beneath the Antarctic ice. They have discovered microorganisms living in the ice, and are keen to explore subglacial lakes, such as Lake Vostok. This research requires drilling technology that would enable scientists to obtain samples from deep in the ice without contaminating the unique environments there.</p>

<p>"We are at a point where several disciplines have come to the conclusion that they need a new tool in order to start a new stage of discovery in Antarctica," Tulaczyk said. "I hope that this workshop will be the first step on the way to a complete exploration of Antarctica."</p>
