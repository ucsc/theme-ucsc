Houston moved into a house where a story was waiting for him. "My wife and I were just looking for a inexpensive place to live and it was just an empty house in Santa Cruz. At the time, I didn't know it had a story to tell," said Houston.</p><p>That story, about the experiences of the James Frazier Reed family who came to California with the Donner party, became his novel Snow Mountain Passage, which was hailed by the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post as one of the best books of 2001. Houston will read from Snow Mountain Passage and talk about the development of his novel and the Reed family's story in the context of the Donner party episode at the Friends of the University of California, Santa Cruz Library annual meeting on Wednesday, May 8, at 4:30 p.m. at the McHenry Library patio.</p><p>"The story came to me by osmosis, but I wasn't thinking of myself as someone who wrote history," said Houston. "So I just kept track of little trickles of information about the house on the side." Meanwhile, Houston occasionally taught creative writing at UC Santa Cruz and published six novels, including his prize-winning The Last Paradise, and Farewell to Manzanar, coauthored with his wife, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston.</p><p>A dozen years ago those "trickles of information" became a torrent when Houston discovered, by chance, the keystone for his novel. While working on a local-history project he learned that James Frazier Reed's daughter, Patty Reed, had lived in his house on Schwan Lake in Santa Cruz from 1915 until her death in 1923. </p><p>He realized the view from his house was still similar to the view Patty Reed saw when she looked out over the lake to the beach and the bay beyond. He saw that some of the furnishing had been in the house since Patty Reed's time. So when Houston began writing the story to which his home had led him, he incorporated Patty Reed's memories as an older woman, sitting on her front porch, looking out on Monterey Bay.</p><p>In the four years Houston worked on Snow Mountain Passage, he spent hours doing research in Special Collections at McHenry Library. "Special Collections has some very important materials relating to this period of Western settlement," said Houston. "I was looking at a lot of primary materials, like photographs of Santa Cruz County, pioneer memoirs, accounts of wagon parties." His meticulous research paid off with evocative details throughout the novel, such as a description of the "double-decker Palace Car" wagon James Frazier Reed designed to transport his family from Illinois to California. </p><p>"When I finally sat down to try and find a way to tell the family's story," said Houston, "I began to hear Patty Reed's voice, as the elderly woman she'd been in the years she lived in my house. I wouldn't say it was an actual sound inside my head; rather, it was the distinct awareness of a certain way of speaking. And that was the day I began to write."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bf2dc8072704601a012ffa0a9e237"><name>116</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Innovative theater and film free at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Ann M.

Chautauqua is the culmination of eight month's work by over 160 students, under the guidance of assistant professor of theater arts Kimberly Jannarone. Students in Chautauqua fill at least three jobs within the festival, covering all aspects of production from acting to publicity, technical design to ushering, concessions to costuming. This year students secured sponsorship from Simple Shoes, underwriting part of the festival cost. For the first time in the history of Chautauqua, the festival has a web site, created, of course, by students.</p><p>The Chautauqua Festival runs May 9 - 12 and 16 - 19, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Center. For more information and a schedule, see the web site http://artstream.ucsc.edu/chautauqua/ or call (831) 459-4731.</p><p>Students also star in International Playhouse, which presents plays in their original languages accompanied by English supertitles. New this year is a performance in Latin, The Conversion of Thais, a medieval comedy by Hrotsvit of Gandersheim, directed by professor of classics Mary-Kay Gamel. Other works include:</p><p>Crosstalk, written by Jacqueline Ku, lecturer in Chinese, and Kevin Miles, a UCSC student. Crosstalk, a comedy about the varieties of tones in the Chinese language, is directed by Jacqueline Ku.</p><p>Scenes from the comedies The Bourgeois Gentleman, by Moliere; Fanny, by Marcel Paul Pagnol; and the groundbreaking absurdist drama The Bald Soprano, by Eugene Ionesco, all in French and directed by Miriam Ellis, lecturer in French.</p><p>The Puppet Show of Miracles, by Miguel de Cervantes, a short comedy based on the legend of the Emperor's new clothes. The Puppet Show of Miracles is presented in Spanish and directed by Paco Ramirez, lecturer in Spanish. </p><p>International Playhouse will be held on May 17 at 8 p.m. and May 18 at 2:30 p.m. at the Cowell College Dining Hall.

Mellon Fellowship in Humanistic Studies.</p>
<p>The prestigious award, which supports exceptionally promising first-year doctoral students preparing for careers in humanities teaching and scholarship, will cover all tuition and required fees for the UC Santa Cruz alumnus in his initial year of graduate study, as well as providing a one-time stipend of $17,500.</p>
<p>"I used to think it was a cliché when people said 'It's an honor just to be nominated,'" said Jacobson. "But now I know it's true. I was thrilled to find out I was a semifinalist, and ecstatic when I won." This year's 95 Mellon Fellows were selected from 753 applicants.</p>
<p>Jacobson is the 17th UC Santa Cruz student to win a Mellon Fellowship, and the sixth winner from UCSC's classics program. A 2000 graduate with a double major in classics and history, Jacobson begins a doctoral program in classics at UC Berkeley this fall. His research interests are primarily Greek poetry, and he plans to teach at the university level after completing his degree.</p>
<p>Mellon Fellows from UCSC have gone on to teaching careers at a variety of institutions, including Rice University in Texas, Northwestern University in Illinois, and Morgan State University in Maryland.</p>
<p>"Without the Mellon Fellowship, I would have had to impose arbitrary limits on my research interests," said Heather James, a UCSC alumna and 1984 Mellon Fellow who is currently an associate professor of English and comparative literature at the University of Southern California. "I attribute my qualifications to carry out research in foreign languages to the time freed up by financial support from my Mellon Fellowship."</p>
<p>A 1989 Mellon Fellowship also helped UCSC alumnus Andrew Escobedo pursue further language study for his humanities research and teaching. Now an assistant professor teaching Renaissance literature at Ohio University, Escobedo said "The Mellon Fellowship paid for my enrollment in intensive language programs in French and ancient Greek, and it saved me a good deal of financial stress during the early years of graduate school."</p>

The public is invited to celebrate the creation of this new children's educational facility from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Garden Classroom is located on the UCSC Farm, and all grand opening events are free.</p>
<p>Four years in the making, the Life Lab Garden Classroom is a model outdoor classroom designed just for children, where youngsters can explore scientific concepts through garden-based exhibits and activities. School groups and teachers will visit the facility on organized tours and workshops, and the Garden Classroom will be open to community visitors for self-guided tours.</p>
<p>Highlights of the new facility include an outdoor kitchen funded by Chez Panisse, the "Rot Zone" featuring 10 different composting systems, a weather station, a pollination garden, a water garden, and the "Sensual Spiral" that highlights plants with different textures, smells, and colors.</p>
<p>Opening-day festivities will include performances by the Banana Slug String Band at 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., outdoor cooking demonstrations, seed sowing, and "worm bingo." In addition, young visitors will be issued "passports" to encourage them to get the most out of the day by touring the garden and visiting "countries" such as "Seedlandia" and "Vegetopia." Fun activities will be set up at each stop, where visitors can have their "passports" stamped before moving on.</p>
<p>"This is a place where children can discover the science of nature," said Life Lab Science Program educational director Erika Perloff, who helped design the outdoor classroom. "The Garden Classroom is a model for the natural world, where children can take apart flowers and find seeds inside, hold worms for the first time, pat chickens, and get a much closer look at the cycles of nature."</p>
<p>Adjacent to UCSC's 25-acre organic Farm, the 2-acre Garden Classroom features engaging, hands-on stations that focus on areas like decomposition, adaptation, wildlife habitats, and the weather.</p>
<p>"In the decomposition station, kids can gather leaves, build a compost pile, check the temperature of piles that have begun to heat up, look at the creatures that break down the organic matter, sift compost and add it to a garden bed, and plant seedlings," said Perloff. "They get an up-close and personal understanding of how nutrient-rich soil helps plants grow. It's all right there for them to see and experience."</p>
<p>Life Lab's hands-on approach to science education has received acclaim from the U.S. Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Sciences. Affiliated with UCSC, Life Lab integrates life, Earth, and physical sciences in ways that make learning fun. Gardening is also a nonthreatening approach to science for teachers, many of whom lack formal science training. The Garden Classroom will host training workshops for veteran teachers as well as those entering the profession. "When used as living laboratories, gardens provide accessible sites for scientific investigation," said Perloff, adding that all Santa Cruz city schools have incorporated Life Lab gardens into their curriculum.</p>
<p>The facility hosts field trips for children in grades 2 through 5 in the spring and fall, with separate themes offered for each grade level. Teachers will receive pre- and post-visit classroom activities and are encouraged to bring their students for two visits each year to capitalize on curriculum changes that vary with the seasons, said Perloff. "Classes in the fall focus on the harvest, while spring tours will focus on planting, growth, soil, and habitat," she said.</p>
<p>"The Garden Classroom has been part of our vision from the beginning, and it will probably always be a work in progress," said Perloff, noting that plans are in the works to create a human sundial and develop a unit on solar energy. The garden was designed by the local landscape architecture firm Joni Janecki and Associates, which donated much of the labor.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1978, Life Lab has provided instructional workshops in nearly 30 states. Hundreds of teachers around the country have turned to Life Lab for an innovative approach to science education. Support for the Garden Classroom included grants from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund, the Gabilan Foundation, and the Stocker Foundation. The Garden Classroom is a joint project of Life Lab and the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems.</p>

The academy honors the nation's most distinguished artists, scientists, and business and political leaders. The selection of Lin and Max brings the number of academy fellows in UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics to eight and the total at UCSC to 18.</p><p>Lin, an expert on the formation of planets and solar systems, is director of the California Space Institute's Center for Origins Studies. Max, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2001, is an associate director of UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics, a Science and Technology Center funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p><p>NSF director Rita Colwell, who will speak at the dedication of the Center for Adaptive Optics in June, was also elected to the academy this year. Other 2002 inductees include actress Anjelica Huston, Senator Edward Kennedy, and businessman Leonard Lauder.</p><p>As a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and now at UCSC, Max has been instrumental in developing adaptive optics systems for the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Adaptive optics is a method to actively compensate for changing distortions that cause blurring of images. In astronomy, adaptive optics is used to correct for the blurring effect of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, researchers can obtain images of celestial objects from ground-based telescopes that are as clear as those from space telescopes. </p><p>"Adaptive optics is important because it allows us to use the huge investment in ground-based telescopes we've made, and it makes those telescopes capable of seeing much more clearly," Max said.</p><p>Max also studies black holes, extremely dense objects found in almost all galaxy centers. Most of these black holes are dark and quiet, but a few shine brightly and emit jets of extremely fast-moving particles. Max uses telescopes with adaptive optics to study these "cosmic fireworks."</p><p>One of the most exciting applications of adaptive optics is its potential to enable large ground-based telescopes to take images of planets around nearby stars. In the past few years there has been an explosion of discoveries of planets outside the solar system. Lin, the academy's other UCSC inductee, has been busy fitting these new observations into theories of planet formation. Lin's basic interest in astrophysics is to understand the formation and evolution of stars, stellar clusters, planets, and planetary systems. </p><p>"I've always wanted to learn where we come from, how the Earth formed, why stars shine. My childhood fascination really keeps me going," Lin said.</p><p>Stars form when cooling gas clouds condense. These clouds usually spin, and over time they whirl faster and faster so that they spin off a protostellar disk. Astronomers believe that planets form in this disk when some of the gas condenses into solids and the solids grow by colliding and sticking to one another. Lin looks at how the protostellar disk interacts with the growing planet and can cause it to move toward or away from the star.</p><p>Lin also examines what happens when planets interact with each other and their parent star after the protostellar disk dissipates. Right now the planets in the solar system are in stable orbits, but eventually that may change.</p><p>"Astronomers think that most planetary systems have a tendency to evolve into chaotic systems," Lin said.

Whitehead will use the grant of $300,000 over five years to support his research on configuration management systems, which help teams of software developers coordinate their work on complex projects.</p><p>Configuration management systems allow each person working on a software development project to make changes and test their effects, to keep track of each version they create, and to examine the overall project to see how their work interacts with that of others. Configuration management is analogous to document management, in which a word-processing program is used to save many drafts of a report or other document and to track changes made by different people. A single software project may involve 50 to 100 people, so configuration management systems are usually more complex than document management systems.</p><p>Configuration management is essential to understanding the state of the software during its development and controlling the changes made to it by different people, Whitehead said. </p><p>"Configuration management is an area where I believe I can make a significant theoretical contribution," he said.</p><p>In the first part of the research project, Whitehead will gather information about all existing configuration management systems--the "configuration management domain" in computer science lingo. He will then develop a domain model by analyzing the existing systems to determine their common features.</p><p>Whitehead plans to extend this work to create a unified domain model for configuration management, document management, knowledge management, hypertext versioning systems, and engineering (computer-aided drafting) databases. These other domains have many similarities to configuration management, yet computer scientists working in these different areas usually do not interact. Whitehead hopes his project will help others see commonalities and encourage the exchange of ideas between different fields.</p><p>In the second part of the project, Whitehead will create a program that automatically generates configuration management systems based on the domain model he created and the specific needs of the user. </p><p>"Every software project is subtly different, but there's only a fixed number of configuration management systems," Whitehead said. "If you can auto-generate them, then you can tailor them to the project."</p><p>In addition to conducting research, each CAREER award recipient works toward specific teaching goals. Whitehead will collaborate with other UC Santa Cruz faculty to develop undergraduate courses and a master's program in software engineering. Instruction on configuration management will figure prominently in both.</p><p>Whitehead is also chair of the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The WebDAV protocol is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that facilitates collaborative authoring directly on an HTTP server. With this protocol, the World Wide Web becomes a writable medium rather than a read-only way to download information. Microsoft Office, Adobe GoLive, and Macromedia Dreamweaver all support the WebDAV protocol.</p><p>The CAREER Program grants are the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards for new faculty. The CAREER Program recognizes and supports the early career development activities of faculty members who are most likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Whitehead at (831) 459-1227 or ejw@soe.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bf9d28072704601a012ff8d155d84"><name>121</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers shed light on bacterial infection linked to ulcers and stomach cancer</title><author>Linley Erin Hall (831) 459-2495; lhall@cats.ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1021273200000</start-date><display-name>Researchers shed light on...</display-name><path>/2002/05/121</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/121</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337929615</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337929615</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>About 40 percent of the U.S. population is infected with a bacterium that can cause stomach inflammation and ulcers and increases the risk of stomach cancer. Although the bacterium, called Helicobacter pylori, was discovered in the 1980s, scientists are just now beginning to understand how it causes infections in the stomach lining.</p><p>Karen Ottemann, assistant professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is studying H. pylori's ability to move around and the role this motility plays in infections. Her latest findings, published in the April issue of the journal Infection and Immunity, indicate that for H. pylori to start and maintain an infection, it needs to be able to swim.</p><p>"It's surprising that motility is used both to start the infection and probably to keep it going," Ottemann said.</p><p>Ottemann uses H. pylori as a model to understand the role of motility in host-parasite interactions generally. The molecular machinery involved in movement represents a potential target for new antibiotics, but no one really knows how bacteria use motility to infect humans and other mammals, she said. </p><p>Bacteria such as H. pylori move around in their animal hosts, but why they move, whether toward food, away from the host's immune cells, or toward or away from other molecules, is still an open question. H. pylori does not grow in the highly acidic stomach environment, so it may need to move quickly to the less acidic mucus layer that coats the stomach lining to achieve infection. Being able to swim in the mucus layer may also thwart the body's defense systems so that the bacterium causes a more persistent infection. </p><p>Infection with H. pylori usually occurs in early childhood, but symptoms do not become apparent until adulthood, if ever. Researchers believe that the bacteria are transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water or oral contact with an infected person. The infection process remains poorly understood, but Ottemann's research on the role of motility is shedding light on this mystery.</p><p>H. pylori moves around using long protein "tails" called flagella. Other researchers showed previously that H. pylori without flagella caused mild infections in mice. Ottemann and graduate student Andrew Lowenthal examined whether lack of motility or some other consequence of the lack of flagella reduced the bacteria's potency. </p><p>Ottemann and Lowenthal introduced mutations into the gene for a protein essential to H. pylori movement, so that the bacteria possessed flagella but could not move. The researchers then compared the mutant bacteria's ability to infect mice with that of normal H. pylori. Some mice exposed to the nonmotile bacterium did not become infected at all, and the ones that did contained fewer bacteria than mice infected with normal H. pylori. Furthermore, much higher doses of the mutant bacteria were required to establish an infection at all--more than one million mutants compared to only 150 normal bacteria. Thus, the bacteria need to be able to swim in order to start and maintain an infection, Ottemann said.</p><p>In the next phase of her research, Ottemann will create H. pylori in which the genes that produce proteins necessary for motility can be turned off after an infection has started. She hopes to show that by shutting down these genes she can halt an already established infection. If true, a compound that stops H. pylori from swimming could be a powerful drug. </p><p>Many people treat H. pylori-induced stomach inflammation with over-the-counter acid reducers until a painful ulcer sends them to a physician. After a breath test or stomach biopsy confirms H. pylori infection, the bacteria are usually wiped out by a course of antibiotics. But antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacterium are appearing. </p><p>Many other bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of diarrhea in the United States, also use flagella to move around. Ottemann's work on motility may be laying the foundation for a whole new class of antibiotics, and is shedding new light on host-parasite interactions. </p><p>"It's amazing how hosts and parasites interact," Ottemann said. "A tiny organism can mess up a large, complex one so easily."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Karen Ottemann at (831) 459-3482 or ottemann@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bfb718072704601a012ff97bd3e1e"><name>122</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art in the Arboretum events at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2495; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1021273200000</start-date><display-name>Art in the Arboretum...</display-name><path>/2002/05/122</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/122</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337929995</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337929995</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If spring is here, can Art in the Arboretum be far behind?

Sandip Ray's film Target (1994), written by his father, will be shown at the Del Mar on May 26.</p><p>"It's amazing, I feel thrilled," said Dilip Basu, associate professor of history and director of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection at the University of California, Santa Cruz, which is sponsoring the screenings. "For many years Ray's films weren't even available, and now there is a growing interest in his work."</p><p>Basu has spearheaded an international effort to collect, restore, and share Ray's films. His work has resulted in the restoration of nearly half of Ray's 37 films, as well as a major Ray film retrospective, which played to standing-room-only crowds in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. Selected films from the retrospective have been showing in Ray film series around the U.S., including at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and will travel to Europe this summer.</p><p>Though virtually unknown in the West prior to this year, The Expedition was one of Ray's most popular films in India. "It's a different kind of Ray film. It's almost a gangster film, and no one associates Ray with gangster films," said Basu. The movie focuses on a rural taxi driver who is approached by a shady businessman with an offer to transport merchandise. </p><p>Just prior to his death in 1992, Satyajit Ray wrote Target as a legacy for his son, who is an award-winning director. Described by the Washington Post as "a subtle, unexpectedly powerful movie," Target tells the story of a village of "Dalits," the lowest segment of the Hindu caste system, struggling against the oppression of a wealthy landowner. </p><p>The Expedition will be shown at 11 a.m. on May 25 and Target will be shown at 11 a.m. on May 26 at the Del Mar Theatre, 1124 Pacific Ave. Tickets for these shows are $5.50.

He has found that protein adaptations are critical to the ability of animals to live in temperatures ranging from freezing to boiling, and that temperature changes of only a few degrees Celsius can lead to adaptations on the molecular level. </p><p>Furthermore, Somero's work with marine animals suggests that some live near the upper limits of their heat tolerance and thus adapt poorly to increasing temperatures. With concerns about global warming on the rise, Somero's group is focusing on the effects of temperature change on marine life. </p><p>Somero earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University and is currently director of Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove.

This event is the annual culmination of the Creative Writing in the Schools program, which places University of California, Santa Cruz, students, trained to teach creative writing workshops, in local secondary schools. The Celebration Reading will be held on May 26 from 2 to 5 p.m. in Room 105, Oakes College, UC Santa Cruz. It is free and open to the public.</p><p>"The most important goal of Creative Writing in the Schools is to shift the attitude of young students from writing as a chore to writing as an expression of what matters to them," said Charles Atkinson, a lecturer in creative writing at UC Santa Cruz who has led the Creative Writing in the Schools program for two years. "And it works. If you give undergraduates a chance to share their own passion for writing with younger students, that passion is infectious." </p><p>More than 3,000 kindergarten through 12th-grade students have participated in the Creative Writing in the Schools program since it began at UCSC six years ago under the leadership of Tom Marshall, English instructor at Cabrillo College, who at that time was a lecturer in literature at UCSC. He has launched a Creative Writing in the Schools program at Cabrillo as well. This year the combined programs will serve about 850 students in more than 30 classrooms across three counties.</p><p>As Marshall gradually expanded Creative Writing in the Schools, he secured funding from UCSC's Educational Partnership Center to target schools serving low-income, at-risk student populations. Schools that do not offer a creative writing class are a top priority for the program.</p><p>"I've learned how challenging it is to establish a program," said Marshall. "But if I step back and look back at the whole picture, it's wonderful what Cabrillo and UCSC have been able to do."</p><p>When Atkinson took over as faculty director for the program at UCSC, he built on Marshall's experience. The program begins during the fall quarter, when Atkinson screens prospective participants through an application process. "I look particularly for students who demonstrate the potential to be good teachers," said Atkinson. "They don't have to be creative writing majors, though many are, and most are juniors and seniors." This year 18 students were chosen for UCSC's program.</p><p>The selected students take a winter-quarter class with Atkinson, learning to design and present creative writing lessons, practice teaching with their classmates, and provide feedback to each other. The students, now dubbed interns to distinguish them from the middle and high school students they will teach, begin their school placements in spring quarter.</p><p>"The day before the first time I taught, I was very nervous," said Brent Hagen, a creative writing intern who is a junior majoring in literature with a minor in education. "But once I was in there, the kids were awesome."</p><p>Interns ordinarily teach two workshops a week, always in the presence of the classroom teacher. Atkinson observes the interns at least twice during the quarter, and they meet as a class weekly to debrief and share what they are learning. By the end of the quarter, each intern's classes will have completed an anthology of writings, from which selected students will share at the Celebration Reading.</p><p>"It's really great to see the kids have a new relationship with writing," said Hagen. "I was pretty sure I wanted to be a teacher, but being in the Creative Writing in the Schools program has solidified that decision for me." Approximately a quarter of the interns who participated in the program last year are now teaching in public schools. </p><p>"We get these middle and high school students to share their lives on paper, and it's moving to see the candor and wisdom that comes through in their writing," said Atkinson. "This program can be life changing for both sets of students."</p><p>For more information on the Celebration Reading, call (831) 459-2155.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c003c8072704601a012ff8c079e27"><name>126</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Classics event features newly discovered third century B.C. poems</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1021618800000</start-date><display-name>Classics event features newly...</display-name><path>/2002/05/126</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/126</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337931272</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337931272</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>100 recently discovered Greek poems, written on papyrus recycled as mummy wrappings, will be the topic of the 17th annual Carl M.

Thousands of hawks, eagles, owls, and other birds die each year from electrocution and collisions with power lines and other electric utility structures.</p>
<p>"It probably doesn't have significant effects on the population of any particular species, but power lines do kill a lot of individual birds, and those birds are all protected under state and federal laws," said Brian Walton, coordinator of the SCPBRG, based at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Electrocution is the main cause of bird deaths related to power transmission structures. Large raptors, such as eagles and hawks, like to perch and sometimes even nest on top of power poles. Electrocutions happen when a bird's wings or other appendages complete a circuit by bridging the gap between two live wires, or a live wire and a grounded wire, or other parts such as transformers and grounded metal crossarms.</p>
<p>"Typically, the bird opens its wings and the wingtips span from one wire to another and complete the circuit. So it's the larger birds that get electrocuted, not only raptors but sometimes herons and other species," Walton said.</p>
<p>In addition to killing birds, electrocutions sometimes start wildfires (when birds catch fire and fall to the ground) and can cause serious power outages. Various methods have been used to reduce the likelihood of electrocutions and collisions, but more work is needed to evaluate their effectiveness, develop improved designs, and find cost-effective ways to implement them, Walton said. Retrofitting all existing power lines would be far too expensive, according to the utility companies, so tools are needed to identify where problems are most likely to occur.</p>
<p>The issue has become more pressing for utility companies in recent years as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted a tougher stance toward the industry over the deaths of protected birds. After years of looking the other way, the agency is now threatening to prosecute and fine companies for the deaths of birds protected under the Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Endangered Species Act. In 1999, a Colorado utility cooperative became the first power company to be prosecuted in federal court for bird electrocutions; the company was fined and forced to retrofit its wiring.</p>
<p>In California, the state Energy Commission has taken the lead in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>"The commission wants to develop effective solutions, and UC Santa Cruz will coordinate that effort for us," said Energy Commissioner Robert Laurie. "This is a worldwide problem; together we are trying to devise solutions that can be used everywhere."</p>
<p>Under the new grant, the SCPBRG will implement a program for the commission to find effective ways of reducing bird deaths caused by electrocutions and collisions with power structures. The program will include research and development activities in four main areas:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Risk Assessment Research to develop ways to identify transmission structures that pose a high risk of electrocutions and collisions, and to determine the extent of the problem in California.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Risk Reduction Research to develop and implement guidelines, tools, and procedures to reduce the extent of bird mortality caused by transmission systems.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Compliance Monitoring to develop and implement procedures, guidelines, and standards for evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Technology Transfer to share information about bird-friendly practices with agencies, researchers, and industry.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Some of the work will be done by SCPBRG researchers, but much of it will probably be subcontracted to other groups, Walton said.</p>
<p>The SCPBRG was established in 1975 to restore the endangered peregrine falcon population in California. The group now applies its expertise to a wide range of bird species and is working toward creative solutions for a variety of wildlife management challenges in the western United States.

Now the UCSC professor emeritus of biology is bringing his expertise and love of science to high school students through the Seymour Intertidal Monitoring Program (SIMP), an educational program he founded in 2000. While learning about marine organisms, the students help track changes in the abundance of key species at different sites in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p><p>"High school students are great because there's always a ready supply," Pearse said. "It's important to introduce people at a young age to the diversity on this coast, to the beauty of it all."</p><p>SIMP has its roots in a survey of the Central Coast carried out by Pearse and other UCSC scientists and students in 1971-73. At 10 different sites, some heavily impacted by human activities and some pristine, they counted how many individuals of common species they could find in the intertidal zone, the strip of beach that is underwater when the tide comes in and exposed to air when the tide goes out. The species counted included anemones, surfgrass, and mussels. </p><p>The 1970s survey was a response to the 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. UCSC researchers wanted a record of the species in case something catastrophic happened in Monterey Bay. </p><p>Pearse continued to monitor intertidal species with his classes through the mid-1990s, although at fewer sites and less frequently. In 1996-97, UCSC students repeated the 1970s survey to determine what changes had occurred, and found more organisms and a greater diversity of species. Pearse wanted the monitoring to continue after his retirement, so he applied for and got a grant from the California Sea Grant program to create an educational program for teens, which became SIMP. </p><p>Students in the SIMP program first learn about the intertidal zone and the monitoring techniques they will use. UCSC's Seymour Marine Discovery Center, which has run the program for the past two years, offers an Introduction to Intertidal Monitoring course for high school students. The students then go to the beach and methodically count the organisms they find. As they watch hermit crabs and sea stars climb over the rocky intertidal zone, the teens get their first taste of science in the field.</p><p>"We wanted students to be involved in something where they can get meaningful data and make a difference," said Kevin Keedy, youth programs manager at the Seymour Center. "We've taken a research program and made it into a workable educational program."</p><p>The students go to one of four sites with rocky intertidal zones: Natural Bridges State Beach, Soquel Point, Almar Street, and Point Pinos. At each site, a line is placed across the intertidal zone to the water. The students count the number of individuals of various species in evenly spaced increments along the line. If global warming increases the sea level, the organisms will move up the beach, and the students' counts will reflect that movement.</p><p>Students also count two conspicuous species, owl limpets and sea stars, within a specific area of the intertidal zone. Owl limpets are easy to see and in danger from human harvesting. Sea stars are an important predator in intertidal systems, and are also very sensitive to environmental change. </p><p>"If there are lots of sea stars, then there's lots to eat and the system is healthy," Pearse said.</p><p>SIMP currently includes students from Harbor High School in Santa Cruz, Aptos High School, Watsonville High School, and Monterey Academy of Ocean Sciences. The Santa Cruz Homeschool Program and volunteers from Save Our Shores are also involved. </p><p>The program's web site (<a href="http://simp.ucsc.edu" target="new">http://simp.ucsc.edu</a>) includes all educational materials necessary to prepare for and perform a count, from creature descriptions to data sheets. Within the next year, the web site will become interactive: Students will be able to enter and graph their data, then compare it to the counts done by other groups. </p><p>Eventually participants will be able to compare their data to counts from southern California and Washington. The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) is in the process of incorporating SIMP into a broader sanctuary education program.</p><p>"Getting the program off the ground has been very rewarding, and we look forward to working with the sanctuary to expand it," Keedy said.</p><p>The five national marine sanctuaries on the West Coast have applied for a grant to link all their monitoring efforts. If they receive the funding, the sanctuaries will sponsor teacher-training workshops, and students will have access to data from all of the sanctuaries. </p><p>"We're very excited about integrating SIMP into the sanctuary," said Dawn Hayes, education outreach coordinator at MBNMS. "It allows us to maintain the program but also grow it out."</p><p>The MBNMS also plans to incorporate SIMP into its Sanctuary Integrated Monitoring Network (SIMoN), which involves professional researchers from UCSC and other institutions studying all aspects of the sanctuary. Hayes wants to create more partnerships between researchers and teachers so students can get involved in other research projects such as water-quality monitoring. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact John Pearse at (831) 459-2455 or pearse@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/" target="new">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c08028072704601a012fff55fa4c4"><name>132</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduates honored at UCSC Achievement Awards ceremony</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2496; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1022569200000</start-date><display-name>Undergraduates honored at UCSC...</display-name><path>/2002/05/132</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/132</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337933262</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337933262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More than 400 UC Santa Cruz undergraduates who have received national, state, and campus awards will be honored at the annual Student Achievement Week Awards ceremony on May 31 from 3 to 5 p.m. at University House on the UCSC campus.

In September, 12 students will enroll at UCSC as recipients of Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards, a program created to foster the transfer of accomplished students who overcame adverse socioeconomic circumstances.</p><p>Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies. </p><p>"This visionary program, created by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister, has helped nearly 130 students pursue their dreams of a four-year degree," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "UCSC has had the honor of enrolling these students, who bring a commitment to community service and a depth of life experience to the university. It is a genuine pleasure to award these scholarships each spring."</p><p>The scholarship program recognizes students who have made a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by the chancellor in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee. </p><p>A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. Biographical information about each recipient is also available below.

Her interests include dance, sculpting, and volunteer work as a spokesperson for Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic (RFTBD), which provides textbooks on tape for those with dyslexia. Dyslexic herself, Avila received the 1999 national "Learning through Listening" award presented by RFTBD to graduating high school seniors. Avila tutors students with dyslexia and other learning disabilities, and she volunteers with the Leukemia Society, the American Heart Foundation, the American Diabetes Foundation, and Thanksgiving Charities. </p><p>Kelly Leanne Bouyer of Marina, Monterey Peninsula College: A single mother putting herself through school, Kelly Bouyer has been president and vice president of the Alpha Gamma Sigma Honor Society at Monterey Peninsula College (MPC), on the Dean's List, a senator in student government where she served on multiple committees, a cheerleader, a member of the African American Student Union, and an active community volunteer and founder of the MPC Scholarship Club. Bouyer credits a difficult childhood with fueling her drive to succeed. Self-supporting since she moved out at the age of 16, she gave birth to her son at 20 and returned to MPC when he was four months old, determined, she wrote in her scholarship application, "to put my son and education first. . . . Struggling has taught me that I can either spend life pitying myself or I can work hard to overcome the tragedies that have plagued me. My losses have become fuel, driving me to succeed at my endeavors."</p><p>Janette Ceniceros of Campbell, West Valley College: An aspiring businesswoman with a passion for computers, Janette Ceniceros plans to major in information systems management and serve as a role model for other children of Mexican immigrants. Ceniceros says her own academic success (she has been on the Dean's List at West Valley College for two semesters and enrolled in the Honors Program) is due in large part to the support she received from the Puente Program, which helps underrepresented students succeed in higher education. As a Puente mentor helping support new students, Ceniceros is helping increase the retention rate and ease the transition for new college students. Fluent in English and Spanish, Ceniceros puts her bilingual skills to work as a part-time bank teller. Accepted to UCSC for this past winter quarter, Ceniceros delayed enrolling to help her family meet the 500-hour construction commitment that will enable them to move into a brand-new home built by Habitat for Humanity.</p><p>Maya Desiree Flores of Hollister, Gavilan College: An aspiring optometrist, Maya Desiree Flores juggles schoolwork with the responsibilities of parenting a 2-year-old daughter. The first in her family to attend college, Flores plans to major in biology. At Gavilan College, she tutors students in mathematics and chemistry. Flores is eager to be a role model for young Latinas, and she has participated in Gavilan's Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Saturday Academy, which seeks to build interest in math and science among junior high school students by inviting them to participate with their parents in hands-on academic enrichment activities. A dedicated student, Flores is a member of Gavilan's Honor Society, Rho Alpha Mu, a chapter of Alpha Gamma Sigma, and she volunteers every week in an optometrist's office to gain work-related experience and to develop a relationship with a professional mentor.</p><p>James Fraser of San Francisco, Cabrillo College: For James Fraser, the path to higher education has been difficult. Fraser suffered a disabling on-the-job hand injury years ago and has held a string of low-paying jobs in a "hand-to-mouth" existence since then. Fraser, who enrolled at Cabrillo College as a re-entry student eager to pursue a career in social work or teaching, now boasts a 4.0 grade-point average and membership in Cabrillo's Honor Society. Fraser plans to major in community studies at UCSC. The father of a 14-year-old daughter, Fraser has at times done without in pursuit of his educational goals, living for months at a time in his car. He now volunteers at homeless shelters, knowing too well what life on the streets is like. </p><p>Jacqueline L. Hunt of San Jose, Mission College: Jacqueline Hunt has overcome severe obstacles in her pursuit of a college education, including an unsupportive family, alcoholic parents whose beatings forced her to move out at the age of 16, and brain damage caused by a head injury sustained during a brutal assault when she was in her early twenties. But Hunt, who described her recovery from the brain injury as "like being born as an adult with pieces missing," took charge of her own rehabilitation, checking out primary readers from the local library and starting over with grammar, math, and spelling. Shortly after enrolling in college in 1980, Hunt dropped out, ashamed of her learning disabilities. Since re-enrolling at Mission College, Hunt has held a near-constant spot on the Dean's Honor Roll, and she has been a dedicated tutor of international students. Her community service includes participation in the San Francisco AIDS Walk, weekly visits with the elderly, and volunteering with Pass the Torch, a supervised mentoring program at Mission College that helps students who are struggling with remedial subjects. She plans to major in psychology at UCSC and to pursue a career in the mental health field.</p><p>Xuemei Li of San Mateo, College of San Mateo: Xuemei Li came to the United States three years ago as the finance department manager of a Beijing-based real estate company. Since then, she has studied English and pursued a degree in computer and information science at the College of San Mateo (CSM). Li, who earned a finance degree at the China Finance Institute, has been a volunteer interpreter for King Trading, Inc., and did graphic design work for the Asian American Curriculum Project, Inc. At CSM, she is a volunteer tutor in the college learning center. Now married to a UCSC alumnus, Li plans to pursue a career that uses information technology in business applications.</p><p>Joel-Henry J. Mansfield of Redwood City, Cañada College: The son of a Berkeley police officer, Joel-Henry Mansfield plans to major in legal studies at UCSC, attend law school, and become a prosecutor. A "straight A student," Mansfield is president of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society at Cañada College, where he is also a student senator and on the Dean's List. He founded the campus literary club, The Literati, began a school newspaper, The Socratean, and organized a lecture series on North American folk culture and a poetry competition on campus. Mansfield tutors physically disabled students and non-native English speakers. An avid musician, Mansfield plays drums professionally and also shares his talents with schools and churches in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Morgan Lee Ney of San Jose, San Jose City College: An aspiring bioengineer, Morgan Ney has earned a 3.81 GPA at San Jose City College (SJCC) and is a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. He shares his enthusiasm for math and science with students he tutors, and he has been a chemistry workshop leader at SJCC as well as a science instructor for Science Adventures in South Bay elementary schools. In 2001, Ney received SJCC's Wendlandt Award, which is given annually to the most outstanding chemistry student.</p><p>Naomi Sumiko Nobida of Salinas, Hartnell College: The mother of a 3-year-old boy, Naomi Nobida plans to major in biochemistry/molecular biology at UCSC on the road to medical school. At Hartnell College, Nobida has participated in the MESA and ACCESS tutoring programs, and she also led supplemental instruction sessions for introductory and general chemistry classes. During last year's Summer Research Institute, an eight-week residential program at UCSC, Nobida impressed her faculty adviser with her knack for lab work, her focus, and her motivation.</p><p>Christina Narcisa Perez of San Jose, De Anza College: Being a role model for her 7-year-old daughter motivates Christina Perez to pursue her dreams of a degree in sociology from UCSC, law school, and a career in the juvenile justice system. Perez grew up with an alcoholic mother and a drug-addicted father, and she was a 15-year-old gang member when her daughter was born. But becoming a mother and participating in the AmeriCorps National Service Network's City Year volunteer service program in 1996 changed her forever. She designed an intervention program for at-risk teens like herself, and the experience of helping others boosted her self-esteem, uncovered her talent for leadership, and helped her develop personal goals. She volunteered for three years as a rape crisis counselor for the YWCA, and in 1999 was hired by the San Jose Juvenile Probation Office as a youth gang specialist in the restorative justice program, where she designed a six-month curriculum for young offenders. That job inspired her to go back to school and pursue a career working with youth. Despite years of financial hardship as a working single mother and part-time student, Perez says her life experience has made her who she is. Now, Perez writes of her daughter with pride, "I see my determination in her eyes when she tells me she is going to go to college one day."</p><p>Chi To of San Jose, Evergreen Valley College: Writing computer programs is challenging and fun, but nothing compares to the "special feeling" Chi To gets when she tests a new program and it works. It's like learning to fly, she wrote in her scholarship application, and it gives her a great sense of satisfaction. To, who immigrated to this country from Vietnam in 1999 with her parents and brother, plans to major in computer science at UCSC. She has been active in the Student Life Involvement Council at Evergreen Valley College (EVC), the student advisory committee responsible for helping build a stronger sense of community on campus. She also tutors students in physics and mathematics.

<p>The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latino studies. Cantú had been hospitalized after suffering a ruptured intestine earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As word of Cantú's death spread, friends and colleagues shared their grief and their memories of a young, passionate sociologist who made lasting contributions to sexuality studies and immigration studies.</p>
<p>"We can't believe this has happened. It's a complete shock to all of us," said Zavella, who was at Cantú's bedside much of the week. "It's such a loss."</p>
<p>Several hundred people attended a memorial service Tuesday, May 28, at Holy Cross Church in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Cantú's work straddled the areas of sexuality studies and immigration studies. He specialized in the ways in which sexuality influences migration. His dissertation, "Border Crossings: Mexican Men and the Sexuality of Migration," focused on Mexican men who have sex with men, and how sexual identity changes in different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>His other interests included race and ethnicity, and Latinos in the U.S. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1999 from UC Irvine, where he earned his Ph.D. in social science. He received a UC President's Doctoral Fellowship and spent the 1999-2000 year as a UC Davis postdoctoral researcher, studying how American gay culture was becoming globalized and commodified.</p>
<p>Sociology professor Candace West, a colleague and friend, said Cantú brought a sense of community to the Sociology Department and shared a "joy of living" with his associates, including students, with whom he had a special connection.</p>
<p>"He was probably responsible for more students hanging on and triumphing--getting their Ph.D.s--than any other faculty member, certainly for Chicano and Latino students," said West. "He was a mainstay."</p>
<p>Cantú and Zavella had recently submitted a proposal to the National Institutes of Health for a four-year, cross-border study on HIV risk among Mexican migrants. They planned to assess the risks among migrants in the Silicon Valley and Monterey Bay areas as well as in the regions around Cuernavaca and Guadalajara in Mexico, said Zavella.</p>
<p>"We were going to look at how location affects sexual behavior and risk taking," she said. "It was a great project that was going to combine his expertise on gay immigrant men and mine on immigrant women. He was pretty excited about it."</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Cantú was revising his dissertation for publication and was collaborating with Eithne Lubheid on an edited anthology, "Queer Moves: Sexuality, Migration, and the Contested Boundaries of U.S. Citizenship," about the queer migrants in the U.S and how they have transformed notions of queerness, racialization, migration, and citizenship.</p>
<p>"His intellectual and social home really was the Chicano/Latino Research Center," said Zavella. "He was a real core member. We all loved his wonderful sense of humor and his plans for expanding our undergraduate apprenticeship program."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cantú was awarded a 2002-03 postdoctoral research fellowship from the International Migration Program of the Social Science Research Council. Established in 1923, the SSRC is an independent, nongovernmental organization that supports social science research, education, and scholarly exchange.</p>
<p>Among his publications are "De Ambiente: Queer Tourism and the Shifting Boundaries of Mexican Male Sexualities," an article that appeared earlier this year in GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies; "The Peripheralization of Rural America: A Case Study of Latino Migrants in America's Heartland," which appeared in the journal Sociological Perspectives; and "Responses to Persons with AIDS: Fear of Contagion or Stigma?," which appeared in the journal Applied Social Psychology.</p>
<p>In 1998, Cantú was named UC Irvine Lauds &amp; Laurels Outstanding Graduate Student. From 1993 until his graduation in 1999, Cantú was cochair of the UCI Lesbian and Gay Faculty/Staff Network, and he was instrumental in founding the Lilac Collective, a speaker series on sexuality studies. He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and Spanish from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1991. He earned his doctorate in social science with emphases in social relations and feminist studies.</p>
<p>Cantú is survived by his life partner, Hernando Molinares, of Santa Cruz; parents Rosario and Lionel Cantú, of San Antonio; sisters Rose Louise and Rachel Diane Cantú, both of San Antonio; a brother, Charles Cantú, of San Antonio; and a grandmother, Herlinda Reyes.</p>
<p>At the family's request, an endowed scholarship is being created to honor Cantú. Contributions should be made payable to the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, with Cantú's name in the memo line, and sent to:</p>

In an altered form, the prion protein becomes an infectious agent that causes "mad cow disease" and its counterparts in other animals, including humans. Researchers now suspect the normal prion protein plays a role in the transport or regulation of copper in the body's tissues.</p><p>"We all have the prion protein in us, but no one knows exactly what its usual function is. In very rare instances it undergoes a change in conformation, and then it causes disease," said Glenn Millhauser, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Millhauser's group is working to understand both the normal and disease-causing forms of the prion protein. </p><p>"The prion protein is the only infectious protein that causes disease in vertebrates. Every time you look at it, you see something surprising," Millhauser said.</p><p>Proteins, which are linear chains of smaller molecules called amino acids, fold into complex three-dimensional shapes to carry out their functions. The prion protein sometimes folds into the wrong shape. Misfolded copies of the protein then act as templates for normal prion proteins to refold incorrectly. These misfolded proteins build up in the brain, causing memory loss, lack of coordination, dementia, and eventually death. The human prion disease is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a variant of which can be acquired by eating beef from a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).</p><p>Although it is still a mystery what the protein normally does, scientists are getting closer to the answer. To discover a protein's function, researchers usually create a mutation in the corresponding gene and observe what goes wrong in lab animals. But animals without a functional prion protein don't have severe medical problems. </p><p>Scientists got their first clue when they discovered that the prion protein binds copper, a mineral essential to living systems in small amounts but toxic at high concentrations. Copper has many functions, including helping the body absorb iron and aiding in nerve and brain function. In humans, too little copper can cause anemia and depression; too much can result in headaches, kidney damage, and psychological problems. Animals without functional prion proteins experience tissue damage that researchers believe is linked to a copper imbalance, but the effects are minimal over the life span of most laboratory animals.</p><p>Millhauser has been working with colleagues at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Medical College of Wisconsin, UC Davis, and UC San Francisco to understand how the prion protein interacts with copper ions. Their research has revealed tantalizing new clues to the possible function of normal prion proteins and the factors involved in misfolding. The group's latest results were published in a March 2002 issue of the journal Biochemistry. </p><p>"Exploring copper regulation could lead to a new level of understanding of how these prion diseases develop and how they cause degeneration of the nervous system," Millhauser said.</p><p>The prion protein binds copper in a domain that contains a series of eight amino acids repeated four or more times. Other researchers had shown that each "octarepeat" binds one copper ion. Millhauser's group found that only five amino acids out of the eight are necessary for copper binding. </p><p>Working with UCSC chemist William Scott, Millhauser also determined the three-dimensional structure of this short sequence bound to copper using a technique called x-ray crystallography. He found that the copper binds to the backbone of the protein in two places and to an amino acid side chain. </p><p>The group confirmed their results with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), a technique that measures copper's absorption of microwaves while in a strong magnetic field. The absorption strength indicates which atoms are bound to the copper. The EPR experiments showed that the binding observed in the x-ray crystallography is the same when the amino acid sequence is dissolved, as it would be in a cell, and when the amino acids are part of the whole protein.</p><p>Metal binding to a protein backbone is extremely sensitive to changes in acidity. If the prion protein's environment becomes acidic, the protein will release copper bound to it. Thus, the prion protein may be part of a system to transport copper in and out of cells using differences in acidity. </p><p>Alternatively, the prion protein could sense the copper concentration outside cells and send a signal to a separate transport system. The amino acid glutamine is part of the repeat sequence in all prion proteins, but it is not involved in copper binding. Millhauser thinks the glutamine might send a signal to the cell when the protein binds copper, perhaps by binding to glutamines in other prion proteins.</p><p>He also believes the glutamine could be important in the misfolding of prion proteins. If glutamines from different prion proteins do bind, then other parts of the protein can come into contact. If one of the proteins is misfolded, it could act as a template for the other protein to become misfolded. Millhauser and Scott are now using x-ray crystallography to examine copper binding to the entire protein and are performing experiments to better understand the misfolding process. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Glenn Millhauser at (831) 459-2176 or glennm@chemistry.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2820b058072704601a012fff3274846"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626685597</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626685597</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2820b058072704601a012fff3274846"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626685597</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626685597</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
