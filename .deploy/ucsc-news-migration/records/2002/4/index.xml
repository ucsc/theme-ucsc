During her visit, Colwell will also meet with UCSC faculty and students, tour the campus, and give a speech on "Research Trends and Opportunities at NSF."</p>
<p>The multi-institutional Center for Adaptive Optics, headquartered at UCSC, was established in 1999 as an NSF Science and Technology Center focused on the advancement and application of adaptive optics technology. Adaptive optics (AO) is used in astronomy and vision science to correct the blurring of images caused when light travels through an unstable medium. For example, turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere limits how clearly astronomers can see stars and other objects with even the largest ground-based telescopes. Similarly, internal imperfections and fluids in the eye not only affect vision but also limit the ability of doctors to get a clear view of the retina to diagnose and correct retinal defects and disease.</p>
<p>"In astronomy, adaptive optics can remove much of the blurring caused by the atmosphere, giving us the sharpest images of stars, planets, and galaxies ever obtained with ground-based telescopes. But there are still significant technical challenges to overcome before we can realize the full potential of this technology," said Jerry Nelson, director of the Center for Adaptive Optics and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>"We are also seeing some major advances in vision science through the use of adaptive optics, and we expect to see new ophthalmic instrumentation developed in the near future," Nelson added.</p>
<p>At the dedication on April 26, the Center for Adaptive Optics will celebrate recent progress in adaptive optics and the completion of a new headquarters building on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The 4,000-square-foot building on Science Hill provides offices and meeting space for faculty, visiting scientists, students, and administrators.</p>
<p>The center has 28 partner institutions, including universities, national laboratories, industry partners, and international collaborators. Five UC campuses, the California Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, University of Houston, University of Rochester, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are among the top institutions advancing the science and technology behind adaptive optics. Industry partners such as Bausch &amp; Lomb and Lucent Technologies are working with the center to develop practical new devices and implement AO applications in health care and other fields.</p>
<p>Researchers affiliated with the center have installed adaptive optics systems on major telescopes at the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, CA, and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. These AO systems use a known source of light as a reference beacon to measure atmospheric distortions, then remove the distortion by bouncing the light off a deformable mirror. The measurement and correction of distortions is repeated hundreds of times per second.</p>
<p>A major advance has been the use of a laser system to create a "virtual" guide star in the upper atmosphere as the reference light-source. A laser guide star system developed at LLNL was recently installed on the Keck II Telescope. One of the challenges for the future will be to devise AO systems that can use multiple guide stars, Nelson said.</p>
<p>In vision science, researchers have developed prototype instruments that show tremendous promise for clinical use. Potential applications include improvements in diagnosis and monitoring of retinal diseases, better contact lenses, and more accurate laser surgery procedures. The current challenges are to bring down the cost of the AO systems for vision science and make them durable and reliable enough for routine clinical use.</p>
<p>The center's education and outreach programs are another major part of its activities. Focusing on underrepresented groups of students from high school to graduate level, the programs are designed to attract and retain a new generation of scientists and engineers. Professional development courses and mentoring programs are offered to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.</p>
<p>The Center for Adaptive Optics is funded by a $20 million, five-year grant from NSF, which is extendable for an additional five years of funding at the same level. The NSF is the single largest source of funding for research at UC Santa Cruz, currently supporting 153 active projects with total annual funding of approximately $19 million.</p>
<p>Rita Colwell has been director of the NSF since 1998. She has spearheaded the agency's emphases in K-12 science and mathematics education, graduate science and engineering education and training, and increased participation of women and minorities in science and engineering. Under Colwell's leadership, the agency has supported major new initiatives in the areas of nanotechnology, biocomplexity, information technology, and the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p>Before taking the helm at NSF, Colwell was president of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute and professor of microbiology at the University of Maryland. She holds a B.S. in bacteriology and an M.S. in genetics from Purdue University, and a Ph.D. in oceanography from the University of Washington.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bd4ea8072704601a012fff543bb96"><name>93</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Albert Whitford, eminent astronomer and former director of Lick Observatory, dies at 96</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1017730800000</start-date><display-name>Albert Whitford, eminent astronomer...</display-name><path>/2002/04/93</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/93</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337920140</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337920140</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Albert E. Whitford, an acclaimed astronomer, former director of the University of California's Lick Observatory, and a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, died on Thursday, March 28. He was 96.</p><p>Whitford died at Meriter Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, after a short illness. </p><p>"He was a very important figure in American astronomy and at Lick Observatory," said Donald Osterbrock, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a close friend of Whitford. "He did a tremendous amount of excellent observational research, chiefly on the structure of our Galaxy, and was a leader of American astronomy for many years."</p><p>Born in 1905 in Milton, Wisconsin, Whitford received a B.A. from Milton College and an M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from the University of Wisconsin. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, he joined the astronomy faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He worked at Wisconsin's Washburn Observatory for 23 years, serving as its director from 1948 through 1958.</p><p>As director of the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton from 1958 to 1968, Whitford oversaw the completion of the 3-meter (120-inch) Shane Telescope in 1959, the observatory's premier research instrument. At the time, it was the second largest telescope in the world, and it is still a highly productive instrument. He was also director when the observatory moved its headquarters to the newly established UC Santa Cruz campus in 1966. The Mt. Hamilton astronomers formed the core of UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p><p>"He planned and led that move, and his leadership and diplomacy made the other astronomers willing to go along, so the move was accomplished without disrupting the observatory," Osterbrock said.</p><p>Whitford is best known for his pioneering work in photoelectric photometry, which began with Joel Stebbins at the University of Wisconsin. Trained in laboratory physics, Whitford greatly improved the sensitivity of photometers. This led to the first precise measurements of the magnitudes and colors of many faint stars, clusters, and galaxies. The "Whitford Reddening Curve," which quantifies the interstellar absorption of light, proved vital in mapping the distribution of stars within our Milky Way Galaxy. Whitford also studied the structures and dynamics of the spherical blobs of stars at the centers of galaxies, known as nuclear bulges. </p><p>Whitford played a key role in the growth of U.S. astronomy, presiding over several national commissions on astronomical research. He chaired a 1953 conference that led to the national observatory system, and he presided over a 1964 report from the National Academy of Sciences, known as the Whitford report, that laid out the first of a series of 10-year plans for the field. </p><p>After resigning from the Lick Observatory directorship in 1968, Whitford returned to full-time research and teaching. He continued to collaborate actively and publish papers with other astronomers at UCSC even after formally retiring from the active faculty when he reached mandatory retirement age in 1973. Whitford lived in Santa Cruz until 1996, when he returned to Madison, Wisconsin. There he continued his active interest in research from an office in the university's Astronomy Department until October 2001.</p><p>Whitford received many honors for his work in astronomy. The American Astronomical Society named him the Henry Norris Russell Lecturer in 1986, and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific awarded him its Catherine Wolfe Bruce Medal in 1996, the highest honors given by each of those societies. Whitford served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1967 to 1970, and he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received honorary doctorate degrees from Milton College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>Whitford married Eleanor Bell Whitelaw in 1937. They remained married until her death in 1986. He is survived by three children--William C. Whitford of Madison, WI, Mary Graves of San Francisco, CA, and Martha Barss of Baltimore, MD--and nine grandchildren, plus many nieces and nephews.</p><p>A memorial service will be held on Sunday, April 14, at 1 p.m. in the auditorium of the Meriter Health Center in Madison. Contributions in Whitford's memory may be sent to Lick Observatory at: Office of the Director, UCO/Lick Observatory, University of California, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064.</p><p>_____</p><p>A photo of Albert Whitford can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bd66d8072704601a012ffd7e16319"><name>94</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz student wins top honors in statewide poetry contests</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2495; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1017817200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz student...</display-name><path>/2002/04/94</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/94</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337920570</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337920570</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A University of California, Santa Cruz, student has earned top honors in two California statewide poetry competitions.

To help launch the new institute, UCSC alumnus Gordon Ringold and his wife Tanya Zarucki have provided a gift of $500,000--the largest outright gift the campus has ever received from an alumnus.</p><p>The STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research is designed to encourage an interdisciplinary approach that integrates science, technology, engineering, policy, and society (the "STEPS" approach) in studying and solving environmental issues. The overall goal of the institute is to foster research linking global and regional environmental processes, a major scientific challenge that has been identified as a top priority by several national environmental task forces over the past two years.</p><p>"Human health depends on ecosystem health, and ecosystem health depends on the processes linking the Earth's ecosystems. The long-term health of our societies therefore requires that we understand these linkages much better than we do now," said John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>Initially, the STEPS Institute will focus on biodiversity and water issues, said Thompson, who led an 18-month campuswide planning process that resulted in the formation of the institute. Thompson will serve as the initial director, and Brent Haddad, associate professor of environmental studies, will be associate director. The institute, overseen by UCSC's Office of Research, will link environmental research efforts campuswide, tapping expertise in a wide range of departments in the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering.</p><p>"The STEPS Institute is one that I feel really builds on the tremendous diversity and strength in the environmental sciences that UCSC has already established," said Ringold, the chairman and CEO of SurroMed, a start-up company developing pharmaceutical and biomedical technologies. Ringold earned a B.A. in biology from UCSC and a Ph.D. in microbiology from UC San Francisco. </p><p>Processes that occur on a global scale, such as global warming and El Niño events, have direct effects on regional environments and are increasingly affecting human societies, Thompson said. Fragmentation and genetic restructuring of ecosystems are also occurring on a global scale, as people alter the Earth's landscapes and move genes and species across continents and oceans. Invasive species introduced from other parts of the world during the past 100 years now dominate many ecosystems on all continents. These rapid changes are profoundly altering environmental processes and reshaping global patterns of biodiversity and global water cycles.</p><p>The STEPS Institute will seek to integrate research that addresses global biodiversity on multiple levels, from genetics to ecosystems. </p><p>"We have to link ecology, evolution, and genetics together so that we can understand how organisms evolve in response to changing environmental conditions and the introduction of new species," Thompson said. "Ecosystems are highly coevolved assemblages of species, and we've been introducing new species with different genetic structures, while we really don't have a clue what that means for ecosystem health in the long term."</p><p>The institute's other major research theme will integrate research linking water, environment, and society, said Haddad, who is an expert on water policy. </p><p>"Water is a critical global link between physical processes, biological processes, ecosystems, and societies," Haddad said. "Water shapes global patterns of genetic diversity, drives ecosystem processes, and affects the health and economic potential of all human societies."</p><p>Several environmental research efforts currrently under way at UCSC will be expanded under the STEPS Institute. These include projects addressing the environmental and social consequences of genetic restructuring of ecosystems worldwide; geographic patterns in genetic diversity along the West Coast; ecological and genetic dynamics of parasite-host interactions across broad geographic landscapes; effects of environmental toxicants on large-scale environmental processes; and effects of changing hydrologic patterns and worldwide water use on environmental processes and on societies.</p><p>All these research problems require the linking of global and regional processes, using approaches that integrate science, technology, engineering, policy, and society, Thompson noted. </p><p>"That's what STEPS is all about," he said. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Thompson at (831) 459-4741 or thompson@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bd91a8072704601a012ff4026ecb2"><name>96</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C.

Some of these programs may face new restrictions in access to information or to laboratory procedures. On Thursday, April 11, M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, will address the consequences of such a trend during the 27th Annual Colloquium for Science and Technology Policy in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>At the April 11 event, which is sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Greenwood will present the 2002 William D. Carey Lecture, "Risky Business: Research Universities in the Post-9/11 Era." She will ask her audience to consider the balance between the free flow of scientific ideas and results, and the risks associated with restrictions that may be implemented.</p>
<p>Greenwood notes that science has been the driver of most of recent economic growth, and that its integrity must be protected in the midst of trends that risk transforming the system that has produced such high-quality research.</p>
<p>"As a Carey Lecturer, I feel a great honor and an awesome responsibility in being given the privilege to present some challenges and suggest some ideas for ways in which science and technology, and their intersection with national policy, can become more important than ever in the quest for peace, security, and justice," Greenwood said.</p>
<p>Chancellor Greenwood, a visionary and role model for the next generation of great leaders in science policy, has spent a career encouraging women scientists to succeed, and inspiring students to excel in math and science. Greenwood, a past president of the AAAS, was recently named to the Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism, a group formed by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council. Her research interests in developmental cell biology, genetics, physiology, and science education qualify her to contribute to the discussion of how the world's scientific and technical resources can best be used to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>Greenwood served as associate director for science in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President of the United States from November 1993 to May 1995, where she played an integral role by supervising the Science Division, providing direction on programs, and developing a budget for the multibillion-dollar fundamental science national effort.</p>
<p>The William D. Carey Lecture was established in honor of Bill Carey upon his retirement as the executive officer of AAAS. The Lectureship recognizes individuals who in their own way demonstrate and epitomize Carey's leadership in communicating the relationship between public policy issues and science and technology. More information about the Lecture and the Colloquium is available at <a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/dspp/rd/colloqu.htm">http://www.aaas.org/spp/dspp/rd/colloqu.htm</a>.</p>

A series of workshops will cover various aspects of doctoral study, including how to apply, obtain financial support, prepare for the GRE, and succeed in a doctoral program.</p><p>"UC Santa Cruz is proud to be hosting the forum this year," said Frank Talamantes, professor of endocrinology at UCSC and vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies. "The forum has a long history of acquainting underrepresented students with the academic challenges and career opportunities associated with graduate school, and allowing recruiters to tap the growing pool of highly qualified undergraduate and master's-level students."</p><p>The forum features faculty panels in which two or three presenters discuss what it takes to prepare for admission to a doctoral program in particular disciplines, what is entailed in doing a doctorate in the field, and what academic and nonacademic career opportunities are available. About 120 recruiters from schools across the country will attend the event. </p><p>Participants are expected from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UCSC, the 10 northern CSU campuses, and many of the northern California private schools, including Stanford University, the University of San Francisco, Mills College, and University of the Pacific. A select group of community college students has also been invited. Invitations are issued on the basis of academic standing and interest in graduate study. </p><p>Roberto Cruz, president of National Hispanic University, will deliver the keynote address during the opening session.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bdb658072704601a012ff2f5bb987"><name>98</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz math professor wins prestigious George Polya Prize</title><author>Linley Erin Hall (831) 459-2495, lhall@cats.ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1018335600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz math...</display-name><path>/2002/04/98</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/98</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337921840</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1500591345832</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will share the prestigious George P&#243;lya Prize with UC Davis professor of mathematics Craig Tracy. The two mathematicians are being honored for their recent breakthroughs in the field of mathematical analysis.</p>
<p>"Harold Widom has long been, and remains, one of the brightest figures in the field of modern mathematical analysis," said Anthony Tromba, professor and chair of the Mathematics Department at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Widom and Tracy are being recognized for their recent work on random matrices, which has aroused great interest among physicists. They have discovered a new class of distribution functions called Tracy-Widom distributions. Like the Gaussian distribution, the familiar bell-shaped curve that describes fluctuations in repeated measurements of a physical quantity, Tracy-Widom distributions describe fluctuations for other classes of random events. Tracy-Widom distributions arise in many different situations, including statistical mechanical growth models and tiling problems.</p>
<p>The P&#243;lya Prize, which consists of a medal and $20,000 in cash, was established by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 1969. Given every two years, the prize alternately awards an achievement in combinatorial theory and one in another area of interest to George P&#243;lya, such as complex analysis or probability theory. P&#243;lya, author of How To Solve It, is best known for his contributions to the field of problem solving. The prize will be presented to Widom and Tracy at SIAM's annual meeting in July.</p>
<p>Widom attended the City College of New York as an undergraduate, then received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the University of Chicago. He came to UC Santa Cruz in 1968 from Cornell University, where he had been a full professor. Widom has been a Sloan Fellow and has won two Guggenheim Fellowships.</p>

UCSC's planned purchase of the Laureate Court Apartments, which are located on the southern corner of the intersection of Bay and High Streets, is expected to be completed sometime in July.</p><p>The university plans to make the apartments part of its faculty and staff housing program. All of the complex's current tenants will be offered six-month extensions to their current lease agreements as part of a transition plan, said Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for colleges, housing, dining and child care services at UCSC. Approximately 20 of the 64 one- and two-bedroom units are currently occupied by UCSC faculty, staff, or students.</p><p>UCSC's purchase of the property has not been finalized, but the campus and the complex's current owners (Laureate Court Partners) have signed a letter of intent that clears the way for a formal agreement and eventual consideration of the purchase by UC Regents, Scott said.</p><p>UCSC's interest in the property stemmed from several factors, including the proximity of the units to the campus. "Obviously, having university housing that is located across the street from the campus entrance makes good planning sense," Scott said. "In particular, we believe that the location of the property will enable the faculty and staff who will live there to have easy access to the campus and reduce vehicular trips and parking impacts."</p><p>In a related action, the campus on Wednesday informed tenants of the on-campus Hagar Court Apartments complex that those 50 units will be converted into for-sale condominiums. "These two actions were planned together and work well together," Scott said. "We have a critical need to provide additional for-sale housing to the faculty and staff who are already here and to those we will be recruiting in the future. At the same time, the acquisition of the Laureate Court Apartments will help us accommodate our current tenants in Hagar Court who are eligible to continue to rent university housing."</p><p>The two-bedroom Hagar Court apartments are currently rented to faculty. According to the timetable for the complex's condominium conversion, renovations will begin this September on 22 of the 50 units; the sale of those units to university employees is expected to begin in December. Renovations on the remaining 28 apartments are scheduled to begin next July, with those units being sold by fall 2003.</p><p>The policies that will govern the rental of the Laureate Court apartments and the sale of the Hagar Court condominiums are currently being developed by the Campus Welfare Committee and will be submitted as recommendations for approval to Campus Provost John Simpson. The Campus Welfare Committee is made up of administrators, senate members, staff members, and students.</p><p>The university has concluded that the two projects, which have been planned together, will not financially impact local jurisdictions. "The current owners of Laureate Court have been paying the County of Santa Cruz $54,000 annually in property taxes, a payment that the university will be exempt from," Scott said. "But, when the Hagar Court units are sold within two years, the buyers will be required to pay property taxes. We estimate that the county will actually realize an overall increase in property tax revenues related to these two projects."</p><p>"The university will work with the city to integrate all applicable policies as defined by city ordinances that apply to the property," Scott added.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Notes: </p><p>Associate Vice Chancellor Scott is available to be interviewed about either or both of these two actions.

Both lectures are free and open to the public.</p><p>The first lecture in the series will be presented Tuesday, April 23, by Pranab Bardhan, professor of economics at UC Berkeley. Bardhan's talk is entitled "Globalization and the Poor." The lecture begins at 7 p.m. in Room 75 of Social Sciences 2.</p><p>Bardhan specializes in international trade and economic development. He has done extensive research on rural institutions in poor countries and on the political economy of development policies. He is chief editor of the Journal of Development Economics and is cochair of the Network on the Effects of Inequality on Economic Performance, which is funded by the MacArthur Foundation. </p><p>On Tuesday, April 30, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, professor of economics at Cambridge University's Trinity College, will present a lecture titled, "Clashing Civilizations and Lesser Tales: A Critique." His talk begins at 7 p.m. in the UCSC Media Theater. </p><p>Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1998 for his work on poverty and welfare. His work on the fundamental problems in welfare economics stems from his broad interest in distributional issues and the poorest members of society. Sen's research has clarified the conditions that permit rules for collective decision making that are consistent with the rights of the individual. Sen's work has also enhanced understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying famines. Sen has used some of the Nobel Prize cash award to establish the Pratichi Trust, which funds literacy, health care, and gender-equity projects in India and Bangladesh. </p><p>College Nine, which opened in 2000, was developed around the theme of global and international studies.

<p>The sale takes place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden enjoy a 10 percent discount on purchases and, on Saturday morning only, early entry beginning at 9 a.m. New memberships and renewals are available beginning at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p>A banner event for local gardeners, the plant sale features more than 400 types of annuals and perennials, including 15 types of lavender, the star of last year's sale. A complete annotated list of plants available at the sale can be found online, with the list of perennials followed by annuals, at <a href="http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/plantlist2.html">http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/plantlist2.html</a>.</p>
<p>In an era of mass-produced hybrids, heirloom varieties are valued for their mouthwatering flavors and array of unusual colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. Technically defined as open-pollinated plants that have been around for at least 50 years, heirlooms are living artifacts brimming with historical importance and cultural ancestry that have been handed down from one generation to the next, attracting chefs and gardeners alike. Because heirloom vegetables tend to ripen over a longer period of time, home gardeners enjoy an extended harvest, and growing heirlooms helps safeguard the genetic diversity of the world's food crops.</p>
<p>Among the classic heirloom vegetables featured at this year's sale are:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Cherokee Purple Tomato: Flattened globes boasting spectacular purple-pink-brown flesh color. This flavorful tomato is known to be more than 100 years old, and is believed to have originated from the Cherokee people.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Lemon Cucumber: Introduced as a novelty in 1894, this highly productive round cucumber is beloved for its bright yellow color, nonbitter skin and easy digestibility.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Antohi Romanian Pepper: A delicious tapered yellow pepper that turns red when fully ripe. (Jan Antohi was a touring acrobat when he defected to the U.S. In late 1991, he returned from a visit to his family in Romania with the seeds of this treasure.)</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

<p>The Bush administration's plan to develop space-based missile defense systems has generated heated debate, but most commentators have overlooked an important and potentially destructive consequence of placing weapons in orbit around the Earth. The militarization of space could create a permanent halo of orbiting debris that will interfere with important scientific and communication satellites, according to Joel Primack, professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"In science fiction movies like Star Wars there are constant explosions, but a few seconds later the screen is clean. It's not going to work that way near a planet," Primack said.</p>
<p>About 3 million kilograms of space debris (roughly 6 million pounds), from dead satellites to paint chips, already orbit the Earth. The U.S. Space Command tracks over 9,000 objects larger than four inches in diameter, and operational satellites can take evasive action to avoid being hit by one of these larger objects. In the range from four inches down to about the size of a marble, there are relatively few objects now in orbit.</p>
<p>The most serious hazard currently is the non-trackable debris smaller than a marble that orbits the planet at speeds around 17,000 miles per hour, 10 times faster than a bullet from a high-powered rifle, Primack said. A BB-sized fragment traveling that speed has the destructive power of a bowling ball moving over 60 miles per hour, and a marble-sized fragment can do even more damage. Satellites are armored, but they can only withstand BB-sized particles. Even the International Space Station is vulnerable to any debris much larger than a BB.</p>
<p>Space-based missiles will generate huge amounts of small debris particles, said Primack. Some will arise from weapon explosions, but even more will come from the resulting small projectiles hitting larger objects already in orbit and fragmenting them. According to Primack, so many bits of junk could eventually be orbiting the Earth that no satellite or space station could be operated in Low Earth Orbit, 200 to 1,250 miles above the planet. Space shuttles and other space vehicles would need heavy armor to pass through the debris.</p>
<p>Most communications satellites are located in higher orbits that would not be as affected by the debris, but some, such as those for mobile phones, are in lower orbits and already in danger. No methods to remove space debris now exist.</p>
<p>"If we do this, we're going to create a terrible problem there's no easy solution for, but the space debris aspect of a 'Star Wars' missile system is just not talked about in the public arena," Primack said.</p>
<p>Primack will give a talk on this issue on April 19 at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris during the Science and the Quest for Meaning Conference. The conference explores the connections between science and spirituality.</p>
<p>Primack said it would be unethical and immoral to jeopardize peaceful uses of space for short-term military gains. Like many researchers, Primack relies on data from astronomical satellites in Low Earth Orbit, where missile defense systems would also be located. His theoretical work on the nature of the "dark matter" in the universe, for example, was supported by evidence from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, which detected fluctuations in the first light of the universe. Space-based telescopes are ushering in a new era in space research, and Primack said he believes researchers will soon be able to answer fundamental questions in cosmology.</p>
<p>"The data from COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other new observatories should at last give astrophysicists a solid foundation on which to construct an overarching theory of the origin and evolution of the universe, an achievement that is also bound to have deep implications for the development of human culture," Primack said.</p>
<p>In 1993, NASA issued the Policy to Limit Orbital Debris Generation, but it has had little impact, Primack said. He hopes that an international treaty prohibiting explosions in space and requiring all satellites to carry mechanisms to de-orbit them safely will be created in the future.</p>
<p>"Every person who cares about the human future in space should also realize that militarizing space jeopardizes the possibility of space exploration," Primack said.</p>
<p>Primack is not new to questions of scientific ethics and policy. He helped to create the American Physical Society Forum on Physics and Society and teaches a course on "Cosmology and Culture" with his wife, attorney Nancy Ellen Abrams, at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

Adams was a biology major at UC Santa Cruz, he occasionally left his books behind and sailed off into Monterey Bay, courtesy of the campus Boating Center. Now, as a successful entrepreneur, he is returning the favor.</p><p>And what a favor it is. Thanks to Adams, the UCSC Community Boating Center is now the proud owner of the 44-foot Zayante, a 1965 Alden Pearson Countess Ketch. The Boating Center has received donations of other vessels, said center director Phil Vandenberg, but never one so large--and rarely one in mint condition--as is the <I>Zayante</I>. </p><p>"It just seemed like a natural thing to do," said Adams, a 1983 Crown College alum who now owns his fourth company, Lighthouse Information Systems, in Scotts Valley. Lighthouse "works with startup and entrepreneurial businesses to accelerate their success," Adams said. "We take on the complete responsibility for IT, which allows our clients to focus their scarce management time, talent, and attention on getting product to market." </p><p>The <I>Zayante</I> takes its place as the grandest of a small fleet of sailboats owned by the Boating Center and available to students and others taking sailing classes. Members of the campus community and the general public who have taken the necessary sailing classes may rent various vessels to sail around the bay, Vandenberg said. </p><p>While specific uses for the boat haven't yet been decided, "there are a myriad of possibilities," he said. In addition to sailing classes and Sailing Club trips, small campus groups may be taken out on special occasions or for whale watching, Vandenberg said. </p><p>The gift will greatly expand the Sailing Club's range; members must now stay where they can be seen from the mouth of Santa Cruz harbor. With the <I>Zayante,</I> trips to Monterey, which would take about three hours, are a possibility.</p><p>Adams said he doesn't consider himself a major philanthropist and that the late-December donation of the <I>Zayante,</I> valued at about $125,000, is his largest charitable gift ever. </p><p>Sailing is not only Adams's hobby, it brought him and wife together. Karen Adams is a manager of online services at Caldera (formerly The Santa Cruz Operation). "She and I met when I was working in Florida and living on a sailboat," he said. "We both moved back here semi-independently and then married a few years later."</p><p>Several factors played a role in his decision to donate the boat. He likes what the Boating Center does for students, the way the boats are kept, and the fact that the <I>Zayante</I> will be used by the center, and not sold for cash. "They genuinely appreciate the gift," Adams said. He is also impressed with Vandenberg. Now in his 30th year at UCSC, Vandenberg knows his way around the Pacific, having raced sailboats to Hawaii 11 times. </p><p>Adams met Vandenberg in 2001 aboard the <I>Zayante,</I> and told him later that "it was clear to me that you would appreciate her--I wanted her to go to a good home that would take care of her, use her, and maintain her."</p><p>The majority of the Boating Center's funding comes from California Department of Waterway grants and private donations--either monetary or in-kind--rather than university funds, Vandenberg said. "We do everything we can to be self-supporting."</p><p>The Adamses had bought <I>Zayante</I> 10 years ago and rebuilt much of it with the idea of spending a few years sailing around. They had sold their house and were getting ready to go when they found out Karen was pregnant with their oldest son, Ross.</p><p>The news changed everything. Since then, their sailing has been more limited, with occasional visits to the Florida Keys to sail, as their family grew again with the addition of another son, James, now 5.</p><p>"Business got so busy three years ago and remains that way and, as such, we didn't use the boat as much as we would have liked," Adams explained.</p><p>"I'm very much a Florida sailor," used to calm seas, he said. "I wasn't used to this bouncy stuff," he said of Monterey Bay. In fact sailing in the water off Santa Cruz tends to make him seasick.</p><p>He's happy his <I>Zayante</I> has found a home where it can be enjoyed. "It's a boat that's basically set up and capable of going around the world, and I'm not going to do that."</p><p>Adams likes having the boat nearby, with an on-board caretaker, and visits a couple of times a week to talk to Vandenberg or drop something off. "I'm still finding little things around the house that belong on the boat."</p><p>His willingness to part with the <I>Zayante</I> reflects his satisfaction with UCSC. Although he doesn't use his science background directly in his work, he feels UCSC gave him a true education.

For example, turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere limits how clearly astronomers can see stars and other objects with even the largest ground-based telescopes. Similarly, internal imperfections and fluids in the eye not only affect vision but also limit the ability of doctors to get a clear view of the retina to diagnose and correct retinal defects and disease. The center has 28 partner institutions.</p><p>A new CfAO headquarters building was recently completed on the UCSC campus.

Coauthor and University of California, Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Geoffrey Pullum hopes that among other things, <I>The Cambridge Grammar</I> will help debunk what he dubs "grammar myths" that have long plagued the world's most widely used language, such as:</p><p><b>Myth:</b> You must never split an infinitive.</p><p><b>Pullum responds:</b> Hemingway didn't write the phrase "to really live" by mistake; it is perfect English. "To" introduces infinitival verb phrases, and "really live" is an infinitival verb phrase (containing a preverbal adverb). Nothing is split in this form of words.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> It's wrong to end a sentence with a preposition. </p><p><b>Pullum responds:</b> Sure, if you're talking about classical Latin or standard French. But if we are talking about languages like modern English, then prepositions at ends of clauses have been normal for a thousand years.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> "They" must never occur with a singular antecedent.</p><p><b>Pullum responds:</b> "They" is standardly used with quantified noun phrase antecedents like "everyone," "no one," and "anybody." So sentences like "Nobody likes paying their taxes" are perfectly grammatical English, and this use has been common for hundreds of years.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> The word "since" must be used only in the time-reference sense.</p><p><b>Pullum responds:</b> No, both uses of "since" are well established. The phase "since Bush became president" has two meanings: (1) "between the time when Bush became president and now" (the temporal sense), and (2) "given that Bush did become president" (inferential). The inferential use was just fine for Will Shakespeare, is in constant use by everyone, and is often not ambiguous at all. By all means prevent needless ambiguity in serious writing if you can; but don't expect arbitrary banning of certain senses of words to do it for you.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> Expressions like "It was me" and "She was taller than him" are incorrect; the correct forms are "It was I" and "She was taller than he."</p><p><b>Pullum responds:</b> The forms with nominative pronouns sound ridiculously stuffy today. In present-day English, the copular verb takes accusative pronoun complements and so does "than." My advice would be this: If someone knocks at your door, and you say "Who's there?" and what you hear in response is "It is I," don't let them in. It's no one you want to know.</p><p>"People have been living in fear of grammar rules that don't exist," said Pullum, who wrote <I>The Cambridge Grammar</I> with Rodney Huddleston of the University of Queensland, Australia. "We're going into the 21st century carrying grammar books from the 20th century that haven't shaken off grammar myths from the 19th century," said Pullum.</p><p>Creating a truly modern grammar text took more than a decade of comprehensive and at times exhausting work by the coauthors and an international group of a dozen contributing linguists. Huddleston began the project in 1987 as a solo effort, and Pullum joined the team in 1995. When he learned of the undertaking, Pullum "thought it was too big a project, and it would kill us all."</p><p>Each of the book's 20 chapters was painstakingly researched, detailing the structure of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and punctuation as actually used in English. "It was worth it for me because of how much I learned. I sometimes changed my mind over things I'd believed for 20 years," said Pullum. Controversial points were resolved through consensus--and sometimes scholarly struggle. "The expression 'That's good enough' doesn't exist for Rodney Huddleston," said Pullum. "If there was disagreement, we looked at the evidence and worked it out."</p><p>For several months prior to its publication, the sun never set on the draft of <I>The Cambridge Grammar,</I> as someone, somewhere in the world, was working on the new reference book. Main proofs were being checked in Australia while backup proofs were reviewed in California; editors were laboring in England and typesetters were working in India. Pullum traded five California summers for Australian winters to work with Huddleston in Queensland.</p><p>It isn't that Pullum and Huddleston expect to see <I>The Cambridge Grammar</I> on the desk of every student of English. At 1,842 pages, it's too heavy to be found in student backpacks. But they do hope it will become the standard reference for anyone writing or revising grammar texts that stock libraries and English classrooms across the grades and around the world. "Grammar books have got to be redesigned, the business of grammar has got to be updated, and <I>The Cambridge Grammar</I> provides a basis from which to start," said Pullum.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914be84c8072704601a012ff29a55906"><name>108</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz researchers featured in PBS documentary series on fishing crisis</title><author>Linley Erin Hall (831) 459-2495, lhall@cats.ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1019113200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz researchers...</display-name><path>/2002/04/108</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/108</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337925143</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337925143</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Cuddly animals such as pandas and sea otters usually steal the limelight in conservation programs. But a new PBS documentary series spotlights fish as animals in desperate need of protection. </p><p>Two UC Santa Cruz researchers are featured in the two-part series, which explores problems associated with fishing and fish farming. Part one of the series, Empty Oceans, Empty Nets, premieres on Earth Day, Monday, April 22, on PBS stations nationwide.</p><p>More than 100 million metric tons of seafood are harvested annually, but the supply is shrinking while demand grows. Overfishing, destructive fishing practices such as trawling, and the increasing human population all contribute to fish stock declines. But, since supermarket shelves are never empty, many people have a hard time believing their dinner may be headed for the endangered species list.</p><p>"People have no concept of how rich the oceans once were," said Steven Berkeley, a research specialist at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences. "If you never saw a fishery, habitat, or wildlife population before exploitation, you don't know what was out there."</p><p>In Empty Oceans, Empty Nets, Berkeley discusses the North Atlantic swordfish fishery. Fishers catch swordfish using longlines, which also catch marlin, sharks, and sailfish. In addition, fishers toss back dead juvenile swordfish they cannot sell because of minimum-size regulations. Berkeley works with the fishing industry to develop fishing gear that will reduce how many unwanted fish are caught. </p><p>"A fisher's livelihood is tied up in fishing, but also in the ability of the ocean to continue to produce fish," Berkeley said. "It's a complex issue, so this isn't just a wildlife documentary."</p><p>Part two, Farming the Seas, looks at the benefits of and problems with aquaculture, or fish farms. In it UCSC's Dennis Kelso, an assistant professor of environmental studies, discusses the environmental aspects of salmon aquaculture. </p><p>The documentary series, produced by Habitat Media, consists of two one-hour episodes. Empty Oceans, Empty Nets will premiere at 9 p.m. on April 22 and repeat at 11 p.m. on April 26. Farming the Seas is still in production and will air sometime in the fall.</p><p>Habitat Media is part of Habitat Productions, a project of the Tides Center, a nonprofit organization in San Francisco. They have produced several award-winning documentaries about sea turtles, and plan to use footage from Empty Oceans, Empty Nets to create a 15-minute film for aquariums and science museums to show.

But new genetic studies show that these traits can be misleading, at least in certain kinds of fish.</p><p>Giacomo Bernardi, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and his colleagues investigated genetic differences in colorful coral reef fish called damselfish. Their findings, published in the March 22 issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, challenge long-held beliefs about damselfish species distinctions.</p><p>"What is a species is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Almost by chance we went straight to this issue," Bernardi said.</p><p>Bernardi's work focused on four closely related damselfish species in the genus Dascyllus. Three of the species are restricted to islands in the Pacific Ocean, such as Hawaii and Marquesas. The fourth, D. trimaculatus, ranges from French Polynesia to the Red Sea. Each species has a different coloration pattern; for example, D. trimaculatus is black with white spots, and D. auripinnis has yellow fins and belly.</p><p>The researchers looked at DNA from damselfish mitochondria, tiny cellular structures that provide energy to the cells of higher organisms. They sequenced a particular section of mitochondrial DNA from 122 different individuals representing the four damselfish species, which were established based on coloring. Bernardi and his colleagues compared the DNA sequences and used the similarities and differences to group closely related individuals. </p><p>Surprisingly, the groupings based on DNA sequences were not the same as the color-based species designations for two of the four species. The damselfish with the largest range, D. trimaculatus, genetically appears to be three different species. One of these new species is genetically indistinguishable from D. auripinnis, even though they have different coloring.</p><p>"We have found that the definition of 'species' is more complicated and a lot more interesting than we thought," Bernardi said.</p><p>The mitochondrial DNA region the researchers analyzed is short, but the large number of individuals studied strengthens their results. Bernardi plans to examine more DNA regions in these species to get a clearer picture of their relationships.</p><p>Damselfish are not endangered or even threatened, although they are popular in the aquarium trade. Nevertheless, genetic analyses like Bernardi's have important conservation applications.

<p>Elizabeth A. Penaat, a founding member of UC Santa Cruz's administrative staff who later became a vice chancellor on campus, died on Thursday, April 25, at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz after a lengthy illness. She was 68.</p>
<p>Named vice chancellor for operations and employee affairs at UCSC in 1975, Penaat was one of the first women named to oversee the business operations of a major U.S. university. "Elizabeth not only was an important figure in UCSC's founding, her subsequent promotion to vice chancellor helped pave the way for a generation of female administrators across the country," said Harold Hyde, who in 1964--a year before UCSC opened to students--asked Penaat to join the administrative team that was establishing the campus.</p>
<p>A native of San Francisco, Penaat grew up in San Carlos and graduated with honors from Mills College in Oakland with degrees in three majors: politics, economics, and philosophy. She joined UCSC after working with the Asia Foundation in San Francisco and in the electronics industry in Silicon Valley. "Elizabeth was a pioneer staff member who was instrumental in building a major university from the ground up," said Hyde, then vice chancellor for business and finance at UCSC.</p>
<p>Upon the retirement of Hyde, former UCSC chancellor Mark Christensen and the UC Regents named Penaat vice chancellor, a promotion that represented an important moment in the university's administrative history, Hyde said. "It sent a signal that women administrators could aspire to become vice chancellors," said Hyde, a longtime friend.</p>
<p>During a 17-year tenure at UCSC that ended with her retirement in 1981, Penaat helped start the campus's building, business, budget, computing, personnel, accounting, housing, and public-safety activities. She was also instrumental in the development of the campus's Farm &amp; Garden. "Alan Chadwick, a charismatic organic gardener, had started a four-acre garden and on-campus farm using the French intensive method of cultivation," Hyde remembered. "Chadwick hated bureaucrats and reporting to anyone, but Elizabeth managed to gain his trust and cooperation and advance the project. These activities have evolved into the campus's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems."</p>
<p>Since coming to UCSC in 1964, Penaat had lived in Ben Lomond in her family's former summer home, a residence that she helped build when she was 10 years old. "We built the place during the war, using wood, windows, and flooring from half an old Army barracks bought as surplus in San Francisco's Civic Center," she once said.</p>
<p>Penaat was also active in community affairs, having served terms as president of the Santa Cruz Red Cross and the United Way of Santa Cruz County, and as a member of the board of directors of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County. She was also an active member of St. John's Church in Felton.</p>
<p>Penaat is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Nan and Clyde Mathieu, of Lake Havasu City, Arizona.</p>
<p>Private services, which are being coordinated by Norman's Family Chapel in Santa Cruz, are pending.</p>
<p>At the family's request, contributions in Elizabeth Penaat's memory should be designated for the Farm &amp; Garden and sent to: the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, UCSC Gift Administration, Carriage House, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.</p>

<p>Nájera-Ramírez, an associate professor of anthropology who specializes in Mexican folklore, is eager to strengthen connections between the university and the community in her new position as codirector of the CLRC. Established in 1992, the center has fostered collaborative work among scholars in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America.</p>
<p>"We are doing wonderful, innovative work, and I want to reach out to community members," she said. "People in Mexico City know what we're doing, but do people in Santa Cruz and Watsonville know?"</p>
<p>Much of the center's work focuses on transborder issues that reflect the movement of populations back and forth across the borders of North, Central, and South America. "We're responding to reality," said Nájera-Ramírez. Some of the other research likely to be of interest to the Central Coast region includes in-depth interviews with Watsonville workers in the post-NAFTA era; research on the impacts of globalization; gender, ethnicity, and sexuality; border studies; and media and popular culture.</p>
<p>Nájera-Ramírez's academic work has been informed by her life experience. Before becoming an anthropologist, fieldwork had an entirely different meaning for this daughter of Mexican immigrants who was born and raised in Davenport, 10 miles north of Santa Cruz. As a child, Nájera-Ramírez and her five siblings picked peas at Cascade Ranch each summer to help her mother make ends meet. Her father had died of cancer when Nájera-Ramírez was eight. She recalls her mother admonishing the six youngsters to "get a good education" to escape work in the fields.</p>
<p>Nájera-Ramírez and her siblings took the message to heart. All attended college, and three earned advanced degrees, including a law degree from Harvard University.</p>
<p>While an undergraduate at UCSC, Nájera-Ramírez joined the Mexican folklorico dance group, Los Mejicas, which became an outlet through which she integrated her interests in folklore, social history, Mexico, and education. After completing a double major in history and Latin American studies with honors, she pursued her interest in dance at the Universidad de Guadalajara.</p>
<p>Inspired to continue her studies at the University of Texas at Austin, Nájera-Ramírez earned a master's in Latin American studies and a doctorate in anthropology with a concentration in folklore. She returned to Santa Cruz as an assistant professor of anthropology at UCSC in 1989. The author of La Fiesta de los Tastoanes: Critical Encounters in Mexican Festival Performance, Nájera-Ramírez conducts research on Mexican cultural traditions. A member of the Chicana/Latina Feminisms Research Cluster, Nájera-Ramírez is coeditor of the forthcoming anthology, "Chicana Feminisms: Disruption in Dialogue," which includes innovative interdisciplinary scholarship. With Norma E. Cantú, she has just published Chicana Traditions: Continuity and Change.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Nájera-Ramírez has helped shape the Latin American and Latino Studies Department and the CLRC. Over the years, the CLRC has gained international recognition for transdisciplinary and cross-border scholarship on Chicano and Latino issues. More than 60 UCSC faculty members and 16 graduate students in the fields of sociology, literature, education, anthropology, and history of consciousness are doing work on Chicano/Latino themes under the auspices of CLRC, said Nájera-Ramírez, who codirects the center with Patricia Zavella, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC.</p>
<p>The center sponsors many cultural events that are open to the public, including film screenings, lectures, and workshops.

Riordan is being honored for his teaching and writing, which explain physics concepts and history so that they are accessible to a wide audience.</p><p>A citation accompanying the award says, "Riordan's work has enhanced the public's appreciation of physics as a source of beneficial applications and as an integral part of our intellectual life." </p><p>The award includes $5,000 for Riordan and $3,000 for a graduate fellowship or lecture series. Riordan has chosen to provide a fellowship at UCSC to support a student in the Science Communication Program's science writing track, a one-year certificate program in which students learn how to communicate science to the general public. </p><p>Riordan teaches a course at UCSC, The Quantum Century, on the history of 20th-century physics. His articles and book reviews about physics have appeared in publications such as the New York Times, Washington Post, New Scientist, and Technology Review. </p><p>Riordan's first book, The Solar Home Book: Heating, Cooling, and Designing with the Sun, written with Bruce Anderson, was a best-seller. His other books include The Hunting of the Quark, which won the 1988 American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award, and Crystal Fire: The Invention of the Transistor and the Birth of the Information Age, written with Lillian Hoddeson. Crystal Fire won the 1999 Sally Hacker Prize of the Society for the History of Technology and was adapted for television by KTCA-TV, Minneapolis.</p><p>"It's important to communicate science to the general public because of its tremendous impact on modern society," Riordan said. "An informed public leads to better decisions about what science and technology research occurs."</p><p>The Gemant Award honors Andrew Gemant, a physicist who wrote six books, 16 volumes of short stories, and 280 scientific papers. Since 1987, the American Institute of Physics has awarded the prize annually to an individual who has linked physics to the arts and humanities. Past recipients include Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinberg, and Freeman Dyson.</p><p>"It's a great honor to be included in the company of these scientists, who have excelled in communicating physics and the role it plays in the wider web of human culture," Riordan said.</p><p>Riordan received a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to his position at UCSC, he is a lecturer in the History and Philosophy of Science Program at Stanford University and leads a group researching and writing a history of the Superconducting Super Collider project. In 1999, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to pursue research on this subject as a Senior Fellow at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Michael Riordan at (831) 459-5687 or michael@slac.stanford.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a281e84a8072704601a012ff5903a916"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626676698</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626676698</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a281e84a8072704601a012ff5903a916"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626676698</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626676698</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
