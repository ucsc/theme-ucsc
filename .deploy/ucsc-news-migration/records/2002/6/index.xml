Their study, complete with temperature and precipitation data for different parts of the state, goes far beyond the usual speculation about the potential impacts of climate change on the state. </p><p>Despite uncertainties in the climate models used to generate these scenarios, they are valuable tools for planning, said Lisa Sloan, an associate professor of Earth sciences at UCSC. The findings of Sloan and her coauthors will be published online on June 7 by the journal Geophysical Research Letters. </p><p>The study supports what many have already guessed--global warming will mean warmer temperatures and smaller snowpacks in California, with serious adverse effects on the state's water supply. But the study also reveals more subtle details, and offers regional specificity and precise numbers backed by a statistical analysis.</p><p>"Everybody has guessed at the effects on water resources, but now we have numbers and locations. It's a lot different from the standard arm-waving," Sloan said. "Our hope is that this kind of study will give state and regional officials a more reliable basis for planning how to cope with climate change."</p><p>Sloan's research group used a sophisticated computer model of the regional climate system to look at the response of California's climate to changing concentrations of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping "greenhouse gas" released by burning of fossil fuels. Sloan worked with graduate students Mark Snyder, who is first author of the paper, and Jason Bell, now a computer programmer in the Earth Sciences Department, to develop a regional climate model centered over California. The regional model offers much finer spatial resolution than larger models used to study the global climate. Since the regional climate is driven by global processes, the regional model was coupled with a global climate model. </p><p>The researchers looked at the effects of doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the preindustrial level. The latest projections of carbon dioxide emissions indicate that the atmospheric concentration will be twice the preindustrial level well before the end of this century and possibly as soon as 2050. </p><p>With atmospheric carbon dioxide doubled, the California regional climate model showed higher average temperatures every month of the year in every part of the state. The extent of the warming varied, however, with the greatest increases in temperature occurring at high elevations in the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. For example, the average temperature in June in the Sierra Nevada increased by 11 degrees Fahrenheit. </p><p>The model also showed rainfall increasing in northern California but staying largely the same in southern California, while snow accumulation in the mountains decreased dramatically. In March, for example, it showed an additional 8 inches of rain falling in the central Sierra, while the height of the snowpack at the end of March dropped by 13 feet. By the end of April, the snowpack was almost completely gone. </p><p>"With less precipitation falling as snow and more as rain, plus higher temperatures creating increased demand for water, the impacts on our water storage system will be enormous," Sloan said.</p><p>Snyder said this report is only the first step in an ongoing effort to understand the implications of climate change for California. The results represent an "average" year, based on 15 years worth of data generated by the model for each carbon dioxide concentration. Additional studies will try to capture the natural variability of the climate and how that variability may change in the future, he said.</p><p>"This opens the door for a lot more studies to look at regional climate change in more detail, and to understand the variability that is likely to occur," Snyder said. "It's important to consider not only the average conditions but also what the extremes will be."</p><p>The researchers are also exploring refinements in the model that would yield even higher spatial resolution. Already, the model provides more detail than any previous study, showing how climate change is likely to affect different parts of the state, such as the Coast Ranges, the Central Valley, the Mojave Desert, and the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>All of the major features of the results were statistically significant, Sloan said. She added, however, that the results are not predictions.</p><p>"The model gives us scenarios of what the future may look like," Sloan said. "There are only two ways to tell how good the model is: One is to wait for 50 years and see what happens, and the other is to model the present day. We've done the latter quite rigorously and have satisfied ourselves that the model does a good job of representing the present climate. So our confidence in these scenarios is pretty good."</p><p>In addition to Sloan, Snyder, and Bell, the paper's authors include Philip Duffy and Bala Govindasamy, both climate researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Sloan's research is supported in part by a fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Sloan at (831) 459-3693 or lcsloan@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c11d38072704601a012ffbfc9c540"><name>139</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: NSF Director Rita Colwell to speak at UCSC on June 21 at dedication of Center for Adaptive Optics</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1023087600000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: NSF Director...</display-name><path>/2002/06/139</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/139</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337935777</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337935777</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>What:</strong> Rita Colwell, director of the National Science Foundation, will speak at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as part of a dedication ceremony for the national Center for Adaptive Optics.</p>

<p>The Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) was established in 1999 as an NSF Science and Technology Center focused on the advancement and application of adaptive optics technology. Adaptive optics is used in astronomy to correct the blurring of images caused when light travels through turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and in vision science to correct for similar effects caused by internal imperfections and fluids in the eye. The center is based at UCSC and has 27 partner institutions.</p>

Does watching violent films encourage violent behavior in teenagers? Should movies be censored?</p><p>These questions are being debated today, but they were also posed nearly 100 years ago by Hugo Münsterberg, a German psychologist who came to America and fell under the enchantment of the new medium called the "photoplay." The first complete collection of his writings about movies has recently been published in Hugo Münsterberg on Film (Routledge, 2002), edited and with an introduction by University of California, Santa Cruz lecturer in art history, Allan Langdale. </p><p>"Münsterberg's book The Photoplay, which was published in 1916, is regarded by many as the first serious piece of film theory," said Langdale about the centerpiece text in the new book. "But as I was preparing to teach a film course, I discovered it had been out of print for decades, and that used copies were going for $65."</p><p>Langdale's new edition has additional writings on film by Münsterberg, including a 1916 interview with him by a representative of Paramount Pictures, an article on The Photoplay by Münsterberg's daughter, and extensive endnotes. In collecting Münsterberg's work, said Langdale, "I strove to create a one-stop source for Munsterberg's writings on film, useful for scholars of film theory, film history, and even psychologists."</p><p>At first glance Münsterberg seems an unusual candidate for groundbreaking writings about movies. An academician and a pioneer in industrial and experimental psychology, he began teaching at Harvard University in 1892. In his essay "Why We Go to the Movies," Münsterberg confesses that he felt it was "undignified for a Harvard professor to attend a moving picture show." But on a trip away from Boston he took a chance and saw the film Neptune's Daughter, an experience that converted him into a champion of the film medium.</p><p>"Münsterberg's interests prepared him in interesting ways to consider the film medium," said Langdale. Münsterberg was fascinated by illusions pertaining to movement and perception, and was attracted to film as a medium in which the sensation of movement exists only as an illusion in the mind of the viewer. As a psychologist, he researched and wrote about memory, suggestion, and emotion, and was intrigued by the combined function of these elements in films.</p><p>Münsterberg believed in the power of the performing, visual, and literary arts to improve both the aesthetics and morality of Americans. His hypothesis that the new medium of film held the potential for improving society will be familiar to contemporary audiences experiencing the promise and the challenges of the Internet and other digital media. </p><p>"Surely I am now under the spell of the 'movies,'" Münsterberg wrote. His enchantment was tragically short lived. Münsterberg died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1916, about two years after seeing his first movie, and before the advent of synchronous sound and color movies. Hugo Münsterberg on Film captures his brief but important career as a film theorist commenting on the creation of a new art form.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c16398072704601a012ff78992ce9"><name>142</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A wildflower, a moth, and a diverse landscape: Shifting relationships offer a rare view of how species interactions evolve</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1023865200000</start-date><display-name>A wildflower, a moth,...</display-name><path>/2002/06/142</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/142</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337936895</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548431508366</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The complicated relationship between a common wildflower and a little gray moth is yielding new insights into how species coevolve, with implications for the conservation of biodiversity. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Washington State University (WSU) described the variable interactions between these two species--a remarkable case study in coevolution--in a paper to be published in the June 13 issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The wildflower, known to botanists as Lithophragma parviflorum, goes by the common names woodland star or prairie starflower. Its life history is entwined with that of an inconspicuous moth called <em>Greya politella</em>. The moth is both a pollinator of <em>L. parviflorum</em> flowers and a consumer of its seeds, a combination of effects that has widely varying outcomes in different habitats. The interaction covers the full range of possibilities, from mutually beneficial to antagonistic, in a complex geographic mosaic.</p>
<p>"This is a particularly interesting interaction for understanding the link between evolution and ecology, and how that plays out over complex landscapes," said John Thompson, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We're finding that much of evolution is about the coevolution of species--how species continually respond to one another, forming complex networks of interaction," Thompson said.</p>
<p>In the <em>Nature</em> paper, Thompson and coauthor Bradley Cunningham of WSU described how these two species--the woodland star and the <em>Greya</em> moth--have coevolved in a variety of habitats throughout western Idaho and adjacent areas of Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>The female moths of <em>G. politella</em> lay their eggs in the flowers of <em>L. parviflorum</em>, inserting a long ovipositor down the neck of the corolla and cutting into the flower's ovary. In the process, the moths pollinate the flowers, carrying pollen from one flower to another on their abdomens. After the eggs hatch, the moth larvae feed on the plant's seeds.</p>
<p>In extensive field surveys, the researchers found the moths associated with every population of <em>L. parviflorum</em> they sampled. Further studies focused on 12 sites in contrasting habitats, including open grassland, ponderosa pine woodland, and streamside canyons. In all but one of the sites, the moths were completely dependent on <em>L. parviflorum</em> for food (nectar for adults and seeds for larvae) and for mating sites.</p>
<p>At each study site, the researchers assessed the development of <em>Lithophragma</em> seed capsules, comparing flowers that had been visited by moths with those that had not. At four sites, flowers without <em>Greya</em> eggs were far more likely to have aborted seed capsules than flowers with eggs, indicating that the flowers depend on the moths for pollination. In the terminology of coevolution, a mutually beneficial relationship like this is called mutualism.</p>
<p>At four other sites, the moths had no effect on the development of seed capsules, indicating a neutral or "commensal" relationship. Thompson said this was due to the presence of enough other insect pollinators to swamp the beneficial effect of pollination by <em>Greya</em>.</p>
<p>"The moths depend on the plants for food, but the plants are not affected either way, because the copollinators are effective and the moths are not abundant enough for their feeding to have a negative effect on the plants," Thompson said.</p>
<p>The relationship looked antagonistic, however, at the remaining four sites. There, <em>L. parviflorum</em> plants selectively aborted seed capsules containing moth eggs, as if they had decided to rely entirely on other insects for pollination and avoid producing seeds for <em>Greya</em> larvae.</p>
<p>"The negative effects of the moths feeding on seeds seems to select for plants with the ability to rid themselves of the moths," Thompson said.</p>
<p>The mutualistic and antagonistic sites are coevolutionary hotspots, he said, where natural selection is acting reciprocally on both species. "It's a kind of tit-for-tat evolution, where one species responds and the other counterresponds, and the two species end up in a coevolutionary vortex," Thompson said.</p>
<p>The complex mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots revealed in this study covers only part of the range of L. parviflorum and G. politella, one of the most widespread plant-insect interactions in western North America. This kind of variation in coevolutionary selection pressures across a broad area may be an important factor shaping the genetic structure of species and the ecological dynamics of natural communities, Thompson said.</p>
<p>"Ecologists have tended to study species interactions at the local level, but these results are telling us that we need to look at larger scales to understand how coevolution shapes biodiversity," he said.</p>
<p>Efforts to conserve biodiversity may also need to encompass large geographic scales.</p>
<p>"If keeping players in the evolutionary game demands a geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots, then fragmentation of habitats will fundamentally change the way coevolution maintains biodiversity," Thompson said.</p>

During her visit, Colwell will also meet with UCSC faculty and students, tour the campus, and give a speech on "NSF's Investment in Converging Frontiers."</p>
<p>Colwell's speech will begin at 1:30 p.m. on Friday, June 21, in Room B206 of the Earth and Marine Sciences Building on the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The multi-institutional Center for Adaptive Optics, headquartered at UCSC, was established in 1999 as an NSF Science and Technology Center focused on the advancement and application of adaptive optics technology. Adaptive optics (AO) is used in astronomy and vision science to correct the blurring of images caused when light travels through a distorting medium. For example, turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere limits how clearly astronomers can see stars and other objects with even the largest ground-based telescopes. Similarly, internal imperfections and fluids in the eye not only affect vision but also limit the ability of doctors to get a clear view of the retina to diagnose and correct retinal defects and disease.</p>
<p>"In astronomy, adaptive optics can remove much of the blurring caused by the atmosphere, giving us the sharpest images ever obtained with ground-based telescopes. We are also seeing some major advances in vision science through the use of adaptive optics, and we expect to see new ophthalmic instrumentation developed in the near future," said Jerry Nelson, director of the Center for Adaptive Optics and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. "But there are still significant technical challenges to overcome before we can realize the full potential of this technology," he added.</p>
<p>At the dedication on June 21, the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) will celebrate recent progress in adaptive optics research and the completion of a new headquarters building on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The 4,000-square-foot building on Science Hill provides offices and meeting space for faculty, visiting scientists, students, and administrators.</p>
<p>Andrea Ghez, an associate director of the CfAO and professor of astronomy and physics at UCLA, will speak at the dedication on adaptive optics applications in astronomy. Austin Roorda, assistant professor of optics at the University of Houston's College of Optometry, will discuss adaptive optics applications in vision science.</p>
<p>The Center for Adaptive Optics is funded by a $20 million, five-year grant from NSF, which is extendable for an additional five years of funding at the same level. The NSF is the single largest source of funding for research at UC Santa Cruz, currently supporting 153 active projects with total annual funding of approximately $19 million.</p>
<p>The Center for Adaptive Optics has 27 partner institutions, including universities, national laboratories, industry partners, and international collaborators. Five UC campuses, the California Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, University of Houston, University of Rochester, Indiana University, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are among the top institutions advancing the science and technology behind adaptive optics. Industry partners such as Bausch &amp; Lomb and Lucent Technologies are working with the center to develop practical new devices and implement AO applications in health care and other fields.</p>
<p>Rita Colwell has been director of the NSF since 1998. She has spearheaded the agency's emphases in K-12 science and mathematics education, graduate science and engineering education and training, and increased participation of women and minorities in science and engineering. Under Colwell's leadership, the agency has supported major new initiatives in the areas of nanotechnology, biocomplexity, information technology, and the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p>Before taking the helm at NSF, Colwell was president of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute and professor of microbiology at the University of Maryland. She holds a B.S. in bacteriology and an M.S. in genetics from Purdue University, and a Ph.D. in oceanography from the University of Washington.</p>

The following is provided as background information to assist you in covering this event.</p>
<p>Adaptive optics technology can remove the blurring effect of the Earth's atmosphere that has long plagued astronomers, allowing ground-based telescopes to achieve a clarity of vision previously attainable only by space-based instruments. Current adaptive optics (AO) systems are able to make images that are superior to those of the Hubble Space Telescope in infrared light.</p>
<p>The technology still has limitations, however. For example, today's adaptive optics systems on the largest telescopes are not able to correct visible-light images. Advanced AO systems now in development are expected to greatly expand the applications for adaptive optics, and will be essential for the next generation of extremely large telescopes now in the planning stages.</p>
<p>"Adaptive optics is working well today on several large telescopes, but for the giant telescopes of the future, the adaptive optics systems will have to be significantly more sophisticated than they are now," said Jerry Nelson, director of the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), a National Science Foundation (NSF) Science and Technology Center based at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Established in 1999, the CfAO plays a key role in the advancement of adaptive optics technology through a network of partners that includes academic institutions, national laboratories, and companies in related industries.</p>
<p>Already, astronomers have been thrilled by the results achieved with adaptive optics systems operating at some of the world's major observatories. At the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, for example, adaptive optics technology has produced eightfold improvements in image quality, said the obervatory's director, Frederic H. Chaffee.</p>
<p>"When the Keck II Telescope was first 'fitted' with adaptive optics in 1999, the effect was as dramatic as someone who has had 20/150 vision all his life getting fitted with glasses and seeing the world with 20/20 eyes for the first time," Chaffee said. "With adaptive optics, the Keck Telescopes are giving astronomers unprecedented views of the planets and their moons, nearby stars, and distant galaxies. It's a whole new universe out there."</p>
<p>Andrea Ghez, an associate director of the CfAO and professor of astronomy and physics at UCLA, is using the AO system on the Keck Telescopes to study the black hole at the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Ghez first demonstrated the existence of a supermassive black hole at the galactic center using a technique called speckle interferometry, a precursor to adaptive optics.</p>
<p>"It was sort of poor-man's adaptive optics, and it provided very limited information compared to what we are now able to gather using adaptive optics," she said. "For example, we can now start to use spectroscopy to understand the types of stars that are located in the vicinity of the black hole, and we are getting some very surprising results."</p>
<p>An adaptive optics system uses a point source of light as a reference beacon to measure the effects of the atmosphere. The light is analyzed by a detector, called a wavefront sensor, that measures how the light waves were distorted as they passed through the atmosphere. The light collected by the telescope is then bounced off a deformable mirror that changes shape to counteract the distortions measured by the wavefront sensor. A high-speed computer calculates the necessary corrections several hundred times per second, enabling the system to respond to the constantly changing turbulence of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The light source for the reference beacon can be a bright star in the sky--either the same star being studied or a star adjacent to the object of interest, which might be a faint, distant galaxy. Relying on these "natural" guide stars, however, limits AO observations to the small fraction of the sky that is close to relatively bright stars--only about 1 percent of the sky. So researchers have devised ways of creating artificial guide stars using powerful lasers.</p>
<p>Laser guide stars are still being perfected, however, and most AO observations are still done using natural guide stars. Searching for planets and other dim objects around nearby stars is a natural application for this approach, said CfAO director Nelson.</p>
<p>"A bright star gives off a lot of light that gets spread out by the atmosphere, producing a haze that blocks your ability to see faint things nearby, such as a planet, a red dwarf, or a disk of dust where planets may be forming," Nelson said.</p>
<p>Adaptive optics can be used to concentrate the starlight into a smaller region, while at the same time concentrating the light from faint objects, making them easier to detect. This can be done to some extent with current AO systems, as was demonstrated early this year by astronomers at the University of Hawaii and UC Berkeley who used the AO systems on the Gemini North and Keck Telescopes to obtain images of a brown dwarf in a close orbit around its parent star. Researchers are also working to develop specialized "extreme AO" systems that are specifically tailored for such high-contrast observations.</p>
<p>"You need a lot of light to do this, so it will only work around bright stars. But that's where we want to look anyway to find planets," Nelson said. "I think in the next two to three years we can expect dramatic improvements in this area."</p>
<p>Currently, only the 3-meter Shane Telescope at UC's Lick Observatory has an operational laser guide star that astronomers are using for observations. Within the next few months, however, researchers expect to begin using a laser guide star system recently installed on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope. CfAO researchers at UCSC and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are working with the observatory's staff to integrate the laser with the Keck AO system and optimize its performance.</p>
<p>"The laser guide star allows us to make observations anywhere in the sky using adaptive optics," said CfAO associate director Claire Max.</p>
<p>Max, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC with a joint appointment at LLNL, led the LLNL teams that developed laser guide stars for the Lick and Keck Observatories. The Lick AO system was also built by her group at LLNL, and the Keck AO system was built in a partnership between LLNL and the Keck Observatory.</p>
<p>At both Lick and Keck, a powerful laser tuned to the wavelength at which sodium atoms absorb and emit light is used to create a glowing spot in a sodium-rich layer of the upper atmosphere. This artificial star is not visible to the naked eye, but it provides enough light for the AO system's wavefront sensor to analyze. Building the specialized lasers is expensive, however, and operating them can be challenging.</p>
<p>"They are really prototypes, and we need to develop better laser technology to make it broadly useful to more observatories," Max said.</p>
<p>The cutting edge of adaptive optics technology is an area called multi-conjugate AO, which requires multiple laser beacons in the sky. There are many challenges to be overcome, but Nelson predicted that a multi-conjugate AO system will be in place on the Gemini South Telescope in about 5 years.</p>
<p>"Designing multi-conjugate AO systems is a high priority for the CfAO," Nelson said. "At a qualitative level, we understand how to go about building one of these systems, but it will not be easy. The analytical tools are far from complete, and the technology for the mirrors and the lasers is also very challenging. But it's the only reasonable way to build AO systems for the giant telescopes with 30-meter or 50-meter mirrors that are being planned for the future."</p>
<p>In the meantime, researchers are eager to begin using the Keck laser guide star--especially those studying extremely faint, distant galaxies. Astronomers James Larkin at UCLA and David Koo and Eric Steinbring at UCSC have used the Keck AO system with natural guide stars to study a handful of distant galaxies, some of which had already been imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). HST and Keck provide complementary information, because the HST works best for imaging visible light, or "optical" wavelengths, whereas adaptive optics works best at near infrared wavelengths.</p>
<p>"With adaptive optics, the Keck Telescopes can outperform the Hubble in the near infrared, which means we can now look at these very distant galaxies not only in the optical range with the Hubble, but also with the same precision and sharpness in the near infrared with Keck," said Koo, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>This is important because the redshift effect, whereby light from distant objects is shifted to longer wavelengths by the expansion of the universe, causes the visible light originally emitted by these distant galaxies to be shifted into the near infrared by the time it reaches Earth.</p>
<p>"When you look in the near infrared with adaptive optics, you're seeing the original visible light from these galaxies, while the optical images from Hubble are actually the original ultraviolet light," said Steinbring, a postdoctoral researcher working with Koo.</p>
<p>The sharpness, or resolution, of the Keck AO images is just good enough to distinguish important structural features of the galaxies, such as spiral arms and central bulges, Koo said. With the laser guide star, astronomers will get that same resolution all over the sky, which will enable them to study many more distant galaxies, gathering valuable clues about the processes involved in galaxy formation. The small sample studied so far doesn't provide much information about galaxy formation, but it does show that adaptive optics is a very powerful tool for studying faint galaxies, Steinbring said.</p>
<p>"It wasn't obvious at first that this would work, so it's exciting that we can do this at all from ground-based telescopes," he said. _____ Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c1a1f8072704601a012ff9fc2d2ae"><name>145</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Background, Center for AO dedication: Adaptive optics technology provides powerful tools for eye doctors</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1024297200000</start-date><display-name>Background, Center for AO...</display-name><path>/2002/06/145</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/145</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337937876</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337937876</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Note to reporters:</strong> Austin Roorda will give a presentation on adaptive optics applications in vision science at the dedication of the Center for Adaptive Optics on June 21 at UC Santa Cruz. The following is provided as background information to assist you in covering this event.</p>
<p>The same technology that astronomers are using to sharpen the images from ground-based telescopes is also giving eye specialists better techniques for studying and correcting human vision.</p>
<p>Some of the technology derived from adaptive optics (AO) research is already being used by ophthalmologists to measure aberrations in the eye with unprecedented accuracy, and it may not be long before AO-based devices replace the conventional phoropter used to calculate prescriptions for eyeglasses and contact lenses. In addition, researchers are using adaptive optics technology to obtain extraordinary views of microscopic structures in the eyes of human subjects.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to develop low-cost AO systems for clinical use by ophthalmologists. That's definitely on the horizon, but first we need to reduce the cost and the size of the instruments," said David Williams, director of the Center for Visual Science at the University of Rochester.</p>
<p>Williams is an associate director of the national Center for Adaptive Optics, which plays a key role in transferring information about developments in adaptive optics from the research labs to industry and the broader scientific community. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the center is based at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and has a network of partners that includes academic institutions, national laboratories, and companies in related industries.</p>
<p>In 1998, Williams and Austin Roorda, then a postdoctoral researcher at Rochester, used an adaptive optics ophthalmoscope to obtain the first images showing the arrangement of all three kinds of cones--the light receptors responsible for color vision--in the living human retina (the back surface inside the eye). Roorda, now at the University of Houston, has since combined adaptive optics with another technique called confocal imaging to construct an even more powerful instrument: the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO).</p>
<p>Using this new instrument, the first of its kind, Roorda is able to view internal structures in the eye in real time and with such high resolution that he can watch individual blood cells moving through tiny blood vessels in the retina. Confocal imaging enables the instrument to focus separately on the different layers of cells within the retina, revealing nerve fibers, blood vessels, and light receptors with a clarity that is greatly enhanced by adaptive optics.</p>
<p>"Using adaptive optics in a scanning laser ophthalmoscope increases the resolution in three dimensions by an order of magnitude, so it's about 10 times better than a conventional scanning laser ophthalmoscope," Roorda said.</p>
<p>Such extraordinary advances in the ability of doctors to study a patient's retina will greatly improve their ability to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases, Roorda said. In addition, these instruments will make it much easier for clinical researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental treatments. Retinal diseases include macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the United States.</p>
<p>An adaptive optics ophthalmoscope could also be very helpful for studying and treating glaucoma, said Michael Drake, vice president for health affairs at the University of California and a professor of ophthalmology at UC San Francisco.</p>
<p>"An important component of glaucoma management is the ability to evaluate the quality of the retinal nerve-fiber layer, so if we could see structures in the retina 10 times better than we can now, that would be outstanding," Drake said.</p>
<p>One spin-off from adaptive optics research, the "wavefront sensor," is already entering clinical use in the form of diagnostic instruments for measuring optical aberrations of the eye. A wavefront sensor is an essential component of any AO system, measuring optical distortions that are then corrected by other components of the system. Stand-alone devices that incorporate wavefront sensors can provide the most precise measurements available of the optical aberrations of the eye.</p>
<p>These devices use a laser beam reflected off the retina so that the light passes out through the eye's optics and onto an array of tiny lenses called lenslets. The lenslet array focuses the light into an array of spots on a detector, producing a wavefront pattern that is like a fingerprint of the eye's optical aberrations.</p>
<p>Conventional devices only measure the two basic refractive errors of the eye--defocus and astigmatism. Eyeglasses, contact lenses, and even laser refractive surgery only correct for these two basic errors, and clinicians have generally ignored the so-called higher-order aberrations. With wavefront sensors, however, a complete analysis of the eye's optical errors is now possible.</p>
<p>The results of wavefront analysis can be used to design customized contact lenses or to guide laser surgery for permanent vision correction. These applications are being developed and tested by several companies. Laser surgery devices that incorporate wavefront analysis are being used in Europe and have been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in the United States. For example, Bausch &amp; Lomb, one of the industry partners of the Center for Adaptive Optics, has conducted clinical trials using a wavefront diagnostic instrument linked to the company's laser refractive surgery device, and has applied for FDA approval of the system.</p>
<p>One of the complicating factors in laser refractive surgery is that the living tissue of the cornea, after being reshaped by the laser, often responds in ways that introduce higher-order aberrations, said Ian Cox, a research fellow at Bausch &amp; Lomb.</p>
<p>"We've found that the wavefront-driven custom surgery significantly reduces the postoperative higher-order aberrations compared to the conventional technique," Cox said. "We haven't completely eliminated them, however, so the next step is to understand what controls those induced aberrations so we can use the wavefront technology more effectively."</p>
<p>Companies are also developing the technology for making customized contact lenses based on wavefront analysis. This is actually a more challenging application than wavefront-driven laser surgery, Cox said. Bausch &amp; Lomb has developed a process for taking wavefront measurements and sending them electronically to a manufacturing site, where the wavefront analysis guides the production of customized lenses. The challenge, according to Cox, is to make that process practical and affordable in comparison with current manufacturing processes, which produce high volumes of low-cost disposable contact lenses based on a limited set of standard corrections.</p>
<p>In an adaptive optics system, the output from a wavefront sensor is used to calculate corrections that actively remove distortions from an image. In an AO ophthalmoscope, for example, a deformable mirror is used to apply a distortion that is the exact reverse of that measured by the wavefront sensor, so that the resulting image is error-free.</p>
<p>CfAO researchers are working to develop a small, low-cost mirror for use in clinical instruments. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology is one promising approach. MEMS devices integrate tiny mechanical elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a silicon chip substrate. Williams and other researchers at the University of Rochester, using a device made by Boston MicroMachines, recently demonstrated the first use of a MEMS mirror in an AO system for vision science.</p>
<p>"It is much cheaper and 25 times smaller than previous devices, so it would be compatible with an instrument designed for use in a doctor's office," Williams said.</p>
<p>The applications of adaptive optics in vision science have received considerable impetus from the knowledge developed by astronomers about how to correct images using AO technology. Although many applications, such as AO ophthalmoscopes, are still in the early developmental stages, adaptive optics is an exciting new technology for vision science, said UC's Drake.</p>
<p>"It's a great concept that offers promise for many new areas of investigation," he said.</p>

Each student, participating in a UC Santa Cruz-sponsored early college-preparation program, was awarded a $2,000 college scholarship that will be held in trust for college.</p><p>Students from the following schools received awards:</p><p>- E. A. Hall Middle School (14 students)</p><p>- Lakeview Middle School (10 students)</p><p>- Rolling Hills Middle School (13 students)</p><p>- Pajaro Middle School (13 students)</p><p>Scholarships were awarded June 17 by the California Student Aid Commission. Recipients are participating in the Gaining Early Awareness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) effort run by the Educational Partnership Center (EPC) at UC Santa Cruz. UCSC GEAR UP program officers who work in the four schools nominated students based on academic performance as well as conditions that impede student access to--and pursuit of--higher education. </p><p>"By introducing sixth graders to the possibility of college and focusing on improved math skills, we're able to help students get motivated and academically prepared for college before high school," said EPC Director Carrol Moran. "These scholarships give students a concrete college goal. By literally putting money in the bank, we address the financial barrier and give students a reason to work hard on their studies."</p><p>Scholarships will be held in trust until the students enroll in college within a year of high school graduation. GEAR UP will contact award recipients each year to track their progress and make sure they are receiving the support they need to realize their goal of attending college.</p><p>Rick Disemone, principal of Rolling Hills Middle School, credited the GEAR UP program with dramatically increasing college awareness among students.</p><p>"When you talked to the kids a couple years ago about their goals, their sights were on getting to the next course or subject, getting to the next grade," he said. "Now when you ask them, they say college, and they smile when they say it."</p><p>GEAR UP supports teachers by providing a college-awareness curriculum and offering training in mathematics. Parents are encouraged to help their children prepare for college, and students are eligible for tutoring by high school and college students. In addition, students get the opportunity to tour college campuses and enroll in residential programs that provide a sneak preview of college life.</p><p>"When the GEAR UP college-awareness curriculum was first introduced, the results were instantaneous," said Cheryl Aho, a school counselor at Pajaro Middle School. "The kids were all talking about college. I've seen how this has truly permeated the culture and community."</p><p>The UCSC GEAR UP program is in its third year of a five-year federal grant. The program serves Watsonville High School and its four feeder middle schools. The objective is to ensure that all students in Watsonville, starting at the sixth-grade level, are motivated and academically prepared</p><p>for college. According to a recent survey of graduating seniors, the number of Watsonville High School students attending four-year colleges doubled since the collaboration with UCSC's EPC started. The EPC provides program review support that helps teachers modify instruction, provides additional assistance for students in need, and evaluates the program.</p><p>Established in 1998, UCSC's EPC is the first stop for K-12 schools, community colleges, businesses, and community-based organizations interested in creating partnerships with the university. The center works with schools and community colleges in Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties and coordinates summer programs that accept students from all over the state. </p><p>In 2000, the EPC provided direct services, including mentoring, academic counseling, tutoring, leadership training, test preparation, academic enrichment, and math training, to more than 15,000 students. Results have been positive, with applications to UC campuses from students in the Santa Cruz/Monterey/San Benito region jumping 12.5 percent in 2001, the largest increase statewide, according to UC's Office of the President.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c1db08072704601a012ff96492a56"><name>158</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ecologist's memoir Called by the Wild traces birth of environmentalism&#13;

Dasmann's new memoir, Called by the Wild: The Autobiography of a Conservationist (Berkeley, CA: University of California, Press, 2002), reflects his desire to give credit to others, but in fact Dasmann is one of a handful of visionaries who gave life to the worldwide environmental movement.</p><p>Dasmann, professor emeritus of ecology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is among those academics whose talent for scientific research is matched by his desire to change the world. A gifted writer equally at home in the field, the classroom, and the policy arena, Dasmann translated his passion for nature into a vision of planet preservation years before the public began to grapple with concepts like conservation and overpopulation.</p><p>Called by the Wild tells the story of an exceptional man's life in a most unpretentious way, beginning with Dasmann's childhood adventures in San Francisco, followed by his service during World War II, his marriage to Elizabeth Sheldon, his work as a field biologist, and his role at the forefront of international conservation efforts, which took him to Africa, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean, and California. Along the way, Dasmann identifies the major threats of population growth, pollution, habitat loss, and species eradication and makes an impassioned plea for sustainability on a planet with limited resources.</p><p>The author of more than a dozen books, including The Destruction of California (1965), Environmental Conservation (fifth edition 1984), Wildlife Biology (second edition 1981), and California's Changing Environment (1981), Dasmann began working as a conservation biologist when the field was just emerging. He fought for the title of his influential text Environmental Conservation at a time when the phrase was unknown, and his pioneering work on game ranching in Africa fostered the field of ecodevelopment and helped make ecotourism a household word.</p><p>Dasmann's academic contributions at UC Santa Cruz and Humboldt State University are complemented by the years he spent working with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), where he helped launch the Man and the Biosphere program. He also worked with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and earned many top awards, including conservation medals from the World Wildlife Society and the Smithsonian Institution. The prestigious Order of the Golden Ark, which recognizes the world's most distinguished conservationists, was bestowed on Dasmann by the Dutch government in 1978. </p><p>Although informed by complex scientific observations, Dasmann's vision of conservation is based on one simple fact: Resources are finite. Yet successful conservation strategies aren't simple, and Dasmann always fought for policies that took into account the full complexities of biology. At the Conservation Foundation, he recalled, a senior official was always chastising Dasmann, saying "Dammit, Dasmann, you keep making things too complicated! We're just trying to get some land set aside, and you keep adding all these complications!"</p><p>Today, says Dasmann, developing countries are stagnating while the United States continues to devour the lion's share of the world's resources.</p><p>"In the United States, we must get a handle on population growth, and we've got to get away from this economic order in which growth is tied to consumption," he said. "Whether the supply of petroleum is going to run out in 50 years or 20 years or 10 years, the fact that it's going to run out is obvious. We've got to face up to the limits of growth, because growth is going to be limited whether we do it voluntarily or not. The growth orientation and the consumerism orientation is really the basis of the problem."</p><p>The public-relations challenges environmentalists face today are similar to those Dasmann faced as a graduate student studying deer populations in northern California. Despite convincing data that predicted a population crash unless the number of deer was reduced, preferably by liberalizing hunting regulations, Dasmann and his colleagues were unable to build the necessary public support among deer hunters, who believed a doe hunt would lead to extinction. As a result, the deer population did indeed crash in the mid-1960s. </p><p>For Dasmann, like many scientific researchers who are committed to using research to inform public policy, the challenge of swaying public opinion remains enormous. There is little satisfaction in being able to say, "I told you so." </p><p>The challenge is to present convincing information, identify simple steps people can take, and spell out how such efforts will accomplish the desired goal, said Dasmann, who conceded it's much easier said than done. Comparing the popularity of gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles to fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, he shook his head in disbelief. "How do you attach prestige to the ecologically most viable object?" he asked with palms upraised in a gesture suggesting his lifelong quest for the answer.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to journalists: To request a review copy of Called by the Wild, please contact Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4399 or via e-mail to jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c1f108072704601a012ffc9f659f6"><name>159</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicists gather at UC Santa Cruz to plan new linear collider project; public invited to lecture on the science of particle physics</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1024902000000</start-date><display-name>Physicists gather at UC...</display-name><path>/2002/06/159</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/159</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337939146</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337939146</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, will host an international gathering of particle physicists this week to discuss the development of a next-generation international particle accelerator facility. The Santa Cruz Linear Collider Retreat, June 26 to 29, will begin with a public presentation on the science of particle physics on Wednesday evening.</p><p>There will be two public lectures on Wednesday, June 26, starting at 7 p.m. in Theater Arts Building M, Room 110. Helen Quinn, a theoretical physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), will speak on "The Science of Particle Physics." Rick Van Kooten, a physicist at Indiana University, will speak on "The Next Mega Machine: The Linear Collider." The talks are free and open to the general public. </p><p>The UCSC meeting is one of a series of meetings of the American Linear Collider Physics Group, which is developing plans for a next-generation linear collider facility, currently referred to simply as the Linear Collider. Physicists use powerful accelerators and colliders to study the fundamental particles of matter and the forces between them. The new Linear Collider is being designed to extend the study of particle physics beyond the capacity of current machines. </p><p>The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC is already involved in research and development of detector technology for the Linear Collider, said Bruce Schumm, associate professor of physics. Schumm, who is organizing the Santa Cruz meeting, leads one of the project's working groups.</p><p>The current prevailing theory of particle physics, called the Standard Model, is based on decades of research at accelerator facilities. It has held up well despite repeated challenges, but precision measurements at currently available energies can only be understood by postulating new phenomena at energies that will be accessible at the next generation of particle colliders. Research at these higher energies will provide new insights about the nature of matter and the forces that shape the universe, and may possibly alter our notions of space and time, Schumm said.</p><p>To develop the Linear Collider, U.S. particle physics labs are working cooperatively with the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany, and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan. Two possible U.S. sites for the Linear Collider have been identified--FermiLab, near Chicago, and a site near Davis, California. DESY is a possible European site, and Japanese scientists are expected to describe potential sites in Japan at the Santa Cruz meeting. </p><p>The Linear Collider project would take many years to complete, and the facility would not begin operation until sometime after 2010, Schumm said. Before then, physicists will begin using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), currently under construction at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a proton-proton collider, producing collisions between protons at higher energies than currently possible. </p><p>The Linear Collider will be an electron-positron collider. Unlike protons, which are composed of smaller particles called quarks and gluons, electrons and positrons are indivisible particles. This means that the results from the Linear Collider will be easier to interpret than those from the LHC. The two facilities will give particle physicists complementary information, Schumm said.</p><p>The Higgs boson, a theoretical particle that may explain how fundamental particles acquire mass, will be a primary focus of attention at both LHC and the Linear Collider.</p><p>"The LHC will almost certainly detect the Higgs boson if it exists, but the Linear Collider will enable us to make precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs particle to determine whether it behaves as predicted and to see if it does in fact solve the problems that it is predicted to solve," Schumm said. </p><p>About 150 physicists are expected to attend the Santa Cruz meeting, including the directors of several national and international physics laboratories, as well as representatives from the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Schumm at (831) 459-3034 or schumm@scipp.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a28231248072704601a012ff58fcdb9f"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626695371</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626695371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a28231248072704601a012ff58fcdb9f"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626695371</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626695371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
