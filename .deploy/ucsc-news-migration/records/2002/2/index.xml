De Alfaro will use the grant of $430,000 over five years to develop new methods and tools for designing embedded software. </p><p>Embedded software runs the computers hidden inside a vast array of everyday products and appliances. These computers, called embedded systems, are found in dishwashers, microwave ovens, toys, cameras, cell phones, handheld "personal digital assistants" (PDAs), and even desktop computers (in the keyboard and mouse, for example). Cars are full of them, as are airplanes, satellites, and "smart" weapons and other military equipment. Demand is skyrocketing for embedded systems that can add new functions and "smart" features to a wide range of products. </p><p>Designing reliable software for increasingly sophisticated and complex embedded systems, however, has become a major challenge. De Alfaro envisions an approach to embedded software design that will enable developers to build complex systems from simpler components with confidence that the components will work together in the final product. </p><p>A key feature of embedded software is that it must interact with physical processes in real time. In a car, for example, an embedded system controlling the power train must respond smoothly to many rapidly changing inputs. It must also work together with other embedded systems controlling the brakes, the steering, the suspension, and so forth.</p><p>But existing programming languages make it difficult to specify real-time behavior, de Alfaro said. It is particularly difficult to program a system to carry out multiple tasks concurrently. </p><p>"We need a better approach to real-time programming that makes it easier to combine software components performing real-time tasks," de Alfaro said. </p><p>His first goal is to create a new "type system," the notation used in programming languages to describe how software interacts. This type system, which could be applied in different programming languages, would enable programmers to easily specify the timing of events and the interactions of different software components. </p><p>"In embedded systems, the challenge is not the complexity of the data but the need to coordinate the timing of different activities," de Alfaro said. "We want to be able to say, for example, that one piece of software executes an algorithm every 200 milliseconds and broadcasts the new values with a delay of at most 10 milliseconds. And when we put that together with other software components, we want to know whether the design will work."</p><p>Programmers currently specify timing by using "alarm clocks" and similar mechanisms. But as embedded systems become more complex, these methods can result in poorly structured code. At an international workshop on embedded software last year (EMSOFT 2001), industry experts reported that the majority of real-time embedded software projects are not completed, and those that are take much longer than expected.</p><p>The second part of de Alfaro's project will focus on the problem of analyzing and debugging complex systems built from simpler components. Software bugs stemming from the interactions of multiple components are often among the hardest to prevent and detect, he said.</p><p>"We want to be able to analyze the components and know that the system will work when we put it all together," de Alfaro said.</p><p>Bugs in embedded software can be very costly. The 1999 crash of NASA's Mars Polar Lander ($165 million) and the 1996 explosion of the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 satellite launcher ($800 million) are spectacular examples. Common consumer products are also vulnerable to problems as they incorporate increasingly complex embedded systems. The power train controller in a car, for example, can have more than 100 embedded software components. </p><p>"Obviously, you can make a car without any microprocessors in it. But it is much easier and cheaper to reduce fuel consumption using embedded software than it is to design a mechanical system that achieves the same thing," de Alfaro said. "Many products now have very complex embedded systems, because manufacturers are trying to squeeze the maximum performance out of the cheapest possible physical setup."</p><p>The current challenges require a paradigm shift for embedded systems, from a sequential model to a concurrent model for real-time programming. De Alfaro's project aims to provide the concepts and tools needed to achieve this paradigm shift.</p><p>The CAREER Program grants are the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards for new faculty. The CAREER program recognizes and supports the early career development activities of faculty members who are most likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century.</p><p></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact de Alfaro at (831) 459-4982 or luca@soe.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ba1698072704601a012ffd223304a"><name>54</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EPA attorney to discuss tribal sovereignty of Native Americans on Feb. 5</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1012546800000</start-date><display-name>EPA attorney to discuss...</display-name><path>/2002/02/54</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/54</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337906968</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337906968</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An attorney for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will discuss "Tribal Sovereignty Now and in the Future," on Tuesday, February 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in the Baobab Lounge at Merrill College on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

But up until 1,000 years ago, these animals bred abundantly on the beaches of Monterey Bay and elsewhere in California. That discovery initially surprised researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who are now trying to explain the species' abrupt disappearance from the local archeological record. </p><p>Evidence gathered by Paul Koch, associate professor of Earth sciences, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, professor of anthropology, and former students Robert Burton and Josh Snodgrass suggests that hunting by early human populations may have been responsible for the fur seals' decline. Their latest results indicate, preliminarily, that marine climate change was not a factor. They reported their findings at the December meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. </p><p>"The northern fur seal was more flexible and widespread in the past than current conservation literature would lead us to believe," Gifford-Gonzalez said. </p><p>If human hunting drove the fur seal out of California, this has important implications for local conservation strategies, added Koch. "The northern fur seal was a dominant animal and a very important component of the local ecosystem until 1,000 years ago, and now it's missing," he said.</p><p>For years, Gifford-Gonzalez and other archaeologists had known that fur seal bones are abundant in the archaeological record along the Central Coast, accounting for about one third of all marine mammal bones. Today, fur seals breed primarily at high latitudes, except for a small rookery on San Miguel Island in southern California, and they rarely visit the California mainland. Were ancient fur seals just Alaskan visitors that came to the California mainland in droves to feed? Or were they native to the California Coast?</p><p>To answer these questions, Gifford-Gonzalez and Snodgrass teamed up with Koch and Burton, who use the bone chemistry of both ancient and modern animals to determine their diets and ecology. Chemicals locked in ancient seal bones can pinpoint where a seal fed during its lifetime. Unique forms of carbon and nitrogen, called isotopes, are found in specific proportions at different points along the ocean and coast and serve to label local regions. The animals absorb these chemicals from their food and store the labels in their bones. </p><p>The analysis showed that fur seals in the fossil record lived in California and fed in offshore waters. They were not immigrants from Alaska. The next question was whether the fur seals were breeding on the California mainland or on islands. Today, fur seals breed exclusively on islands.</p><p>The researchers examined the distribution of the bones of baby fur seals in the archaeological record. From the abundance of pup bones at mainland excavation sites, they concluded that the seals were birthing on the mainland. There were too many bones to be explained by humans scavenging dead pups that might have floated in from an island, and the pups were too young to have reached the site by swimming. </p><p>"Animals aren't going to blow off San Miguel Island and float all the way up to Moss Landing and end up in someone's soup pot," Koch said.</p><p>Koch and Gifford-Gonzalez haven't been able to find seal bones in sites less than 1,000 years old. They reasoned that the seals were driven out either due to a natural climate change or to human hunting. To evaluate the possible role of climate change, Seth Newsome, a graduate student in Earth sciences, conducted a preliminary analysis of sea temperatures before and after 1,000 years ago.</p><p>Mussel shells in the archaeological record serve as a thermometer of past sea temperatures. Mussel shells are formed by the crystallization of calcium carbonate from water. Oxygen isotopes in the water get sorted during this crystallization process in a way that depends on the sea temperature. </p><p>So far, there's no evidence for a change in ocean temperatures at the time the seals disappeared. Almost every other model that could explain the seals' disappearance involves human predation of one sort or another, Koch said. </p><p>According to Koch, restoring fur seals to California's coast should be considered as part of conservation efforts to maintain a healthy coastal ecosystem. Conservation biologists who aim to restore local marine ecosystems are faced with the difficult challenge of choosing a baseline for their restoration efforts, he said. Should the environment be restored to its condition prior to all human interference, prior to European contact, or prior to recent destructive human activities? </p><p>Koch believes that if, in fact, the fur seals were wiped out by early humans, then the "natural" state of the local marine ecosystem is arguably one that includes abundant fur seals with rookeries on the mainland. The system involving seals had been around prior to disturbance for at least 9,000 years, perhaps for a million years, Koch said. </p><p>"It would be sort of silly to ignore what history says is stable just to create something that looks like what the European fur traders first saw," he said. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Paul Koch at (831) 459-5861 or pkoch@es.ucsc.edu and Diane Gifford-Gonzalez at (831) 459-2633 or dianegg@cats.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ba5538072704601a012ff334f12cc"><name>57</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC professor honored as 'civic entrepreneur'</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1012892400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC professor honored as...</display-name><path>/2002/02/57</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/57</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337907994</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337907994</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named the volunteer Civic Entrepreneur of the Year by the California Center for Regional Leadership.</p><p>Pastor, director of UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, is a leader of the movement to forge regional solutions to societal problems.

With all the forces of Madison Avenue arrayed against them, how can milk's dissenters take on "nature's perfect food"?</p><p>"For years, milk has been championed as the perfect food, and now it is being demonized as a symbol of the degradation of modern society," said sociologist E. Melanie DuPuis, author of the new book <I>Nature's Perfect Food: How Milk Became America's Drink</I> (New York, N.Y.: New York University Press, 2002). "The fact is that we need to get beyond the idea that milk is either perfect or it's poison."</p><p>In her research, DuPuis has found that social reformers--from Temperance workers to today's critics of genetically modified foods--have used milk as an organizing tool. "Because it represents purity and the goodness of nature, milk has been a lightning rod for social reformers for more than 150 years," she said.</p><p>As ironic as it seems to compare today's activists to the leaders of the Temperance movement, DuPuis concludes that both movements reflect the unique status of milk. "Using milk as the focal point of a campaign against genetic engineering hits people on a deeper level than would a campaign about soybeans," she said. "Americans care more deeply about milk than anything else they consume, precisely because of all it has come to represent."</p><p>Nutrition and food safety are complex issues that warrant serious attention, asserted DuPuis. "To depict milk as perfect or poison does everyone a disservice," she said. "Consumers are not dupes. They deserve a full debate, and they will seek it out if it's not given to them."</p><p>Milk has not always held the central place on the American table, however. In fact, until the early 1800s, most milk peddled by milkmaids through city streets was buttermilk, a byproduct of the on-farm buttermaking industry. But it was not a common beverage, and most buttermilk was fed to hogs, said DuPuis. By the 1850s, however, a significant drop in breastfeeding gave rise to the use of cow's milk for human consumption. </p><p>DuPuis's book reveals the step-by-step transformation of the dairy industry in the United States and illuminates, for the first time, the role of social reformers whose own calls to action were responsible for the many changes that have brought us to today's model of large-scale factory farming. "That's what's so fascinating about milk," said DuPuis. "It turns out that milk has been intrinsic to every social movement in the United States since about 1850."</p><p>DuPuis writes that the growing demand for cow's milk launched the fledgling dairy industry, which Temperance leaders embraced in their effort to shut down New York City's distilleries. The distilleries disposed of the grain used in fermentation by feeding the leftover "slop" to cows in what became known as "swill dairies." The poorly nourished animals produced a low-quality milk, and Temperance boosters lobbied to have dairy operations moved outside of the city "for the well-being of city children," said DuPuis. A political cartoon from the era depicts a dying cow, too weak even to stand, being milked as it is suspended from rafters. This early city-made milk was called "white poison" due to problems caused by poor sanitation and the lack of refrigeration.</p><p>By the late 1800s, social activists focused on public health and sanitation, calling for the pasteurization of milk and the inspection of dairy farms as part of their vision of a perfect society. Progressive-era reformers sought efficient, large-scale, milk production on intensive dairies and a state-of-the-art transportation system to link rural dairies with populous urban areas. The demand for milk soared during World War I (condensed milk was used to fight malnutrition among European conscripts), and American milk drinking rose steadily until World War II, except during the</p><p>Depression when consumption fell dramatically, triggering strikes that contributed to milk-related New Deal legislation. Today, Americans drink less fluid milk but eat increasingly larger amounts of manufactured milk products like cheese and ice cream.</p><p>By documenting the historical connections between social activists and the dairy industry, DuPuis sheds light on the dynamics of today's debate over milk safety and its nutritional value. </p><p>"Going back to the 1850s, the bucolic cow grazing in the lush pasture has been a powerful organizing symbol," said DuPuis. "Today, consumer health has reemerged as a rallying cry among food activists--and as a marketing angle among organic milk producers."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to journalists: Melanie DuPuis can be reached via e-mail at emdupuis@cats.ucsc.edu or at (831) 459-5376.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ba8128072704601a012ffa4d5e7b9"><name>59</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Editor's Advisory: UC Regents will visit UCSC on February 13-14</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin/Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1012978800000</start-date><display-name>Editor's Advisory: UC Regents...</display-name><path>/2002/02/59</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/59</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337908697</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337908697</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Members of the University of California Board of Regents will visit the UC Santa Cruz campus on Wednesday, February 13, and Thursday, February 14.

M. Keck Observatory, home of the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes. The $10 million instrument will be a critically important tool for astronomers investigating fundamental questions about the origin of the universe.</p><p>DEIMOS (the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph) will multiply by a factor of seven the power of the current Keck spectroscopy system. Observations of distant galaxies using DEIMOS will shed light on the formation and evolution of galaxies, the expansion of the universe, and the influence of "dark matter" on the large-scale structure of the universe.</p><p>Astronomers use spectrographs to separate the light from a distant object into a spectrum of different wavelengths, similar to the way a prism breaks up sunlight into a rainbow of colors. The result is a wavelength "fingerprint" of the object that can reveal a wealth of information about it. DEIMOS is a multi-object spectrograph, capable of gathering spectra from 130 galaxies in a single exposure. </p><p>"It's like having 130 Keck Telescopes taking spectra at the same time," said Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics. Faber led the team that designed and built DEIMOS at the Lick Observatory Laboratories at UCSC, starting in 1993.</p><p>"Multi-object spectroscopy is a relatively new technique that is just as important for astronomers as building bigger telescopes," Faber said. "It is technically very challenging, and we have had to push the state of the art in every respect to build this instrument."</p><p>The advanced optics in DEIMOS include a camera with the largest calcium fluoride lenses ever made. The fabrication and assembly of mechanical components had to be so precise that tolerances were held to less than a thousandth of an inch throughout the instrument. DEIMOS also has the largest spectroscopic detector in the world, gathering 67 million pixels of data per exposure (the equivalent of 300 handheld video cameras).</p><p>"The camera optics have set a new standard for the state of the art, and the detector package represents one of the finest of its kind in the world," said Joseph Miller, director of the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick).</p><p>DEIMOS will be mounted on the Keck II Telescope, one of the twin 10-meter telescopes at the Keck Observatory. When the spectrograph is in use, light gathered by the telescope passes through slits into the body of the spectrograph and is directed to a grating that spreads the light into a spectrum. The camera takes this dispersed light and focuses it to make an image of the spectrum from each slit. The detector measures the light intensity at each part of these spectra.</p><p>"The large detector is a huge asset to DEIMOS, because it allows us not only to gather many spectra at once, but also to spread out each spectrum to detect a broader range of wavelengths and therefore to see more details than would be possible with a smaller detector," Faber said.</p><p>The detector is a mosaic of eight of the largest charge-coupled devices (CCDs) ever made, each 2,000 by 4,000 pixels in size. From each exposure, the detector sends enormous quantities of data streaming through high-speed electronics to a computer for processing and storage. A typical night's work will fill up a 10-gigabyte hard drive with data, Faber said.</p><p>The 450-pound camera, designed by professor of astronomy and astrophysics Harland Epps, has nine lenses, including three made from calcium fluoride, used for its unique refractive properties. Unlike glass, calcium fluoride is a crystal that must be painstakingly grown in a vacuum furnace. The camera also has three glass lenses with "aspherical" surfaces, their curves deviating slightly from a precise spherical shape. It is extremely difficult to polish and test such a surface, and the Lick optical lab perfected a technique for making them using a special device to measure the shape of each surface to an accuracy of a millionth of an inch.</p><p>At nearly 20,000 pounds, DEIMOS is massive, requiring extraordinary measures to compensate for the effects of gravity on the instrument. An active flexure compensation system, never before used on a spectrograph, ensures that the images focused onto the detector are held steady to within a few microns (one micron is a thousandth of a millimeter, or 1/25,000 of an inch).</p><p>"It was a huge challenge to keep the perceived flexure--not the real motion of the materials, but as the detector would see it--to a minimum," said David Cowley, manager of the UCO/Lick Labs. "Without compensation the perceived flexure is less than 150 microns, and the active system reduces that to about 7 microns. It was a huge engineering feat to achieve this."</p><p>"This is the most ambitious instrument ever built at the Lick Laboratories, or anywhere else for that matter," added Miller. "It certainly ranks among the top instruments at any observatory in the world."</p><p>DEIMOS will be the prime instrument for a major survey of distant galaxies. The Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP) Survey will create the most comprehensive map of the distant universe ever attempted, probing tens of thousands of galaxies at the edge of the visible universe. The DEEP team includes Faber and several of her UCSC colleagues, as well as astronomers at UC Berkeley, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and the University of Hawaii. The researchers will look at galaxies billions of light-years away, in effect traveling back in time to study a critical phase in the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p><p>The DEEP Survey will focus on a period from about 5 to 8 billion years ago. In other words, it will look at galaxies whose light has taken 5 to 8 billion years to get here. The faint light from these galaxies poses formidable challenges, which DEIMOS is designed to overcome. By combining the light-gathering capacity of the Keck II Telescope with the exquisite sensitivity of DEIMOS, the researchers will be able to obtain detailed information from some 50,000 distant galaxies. Most importantly, they will be able to derive the mass of each galaxy, a crucial piece of information for testing theories about how galaxies formed and evolved through time.</p><p>The DEEP Survey will also gather information on the large-scale distribution of galaxies and their motions in space. "DEIMOS will map out in considerable detail how galaxies are participating in the expanding universe," Miller said.</p><p>A container ship will take DEIMOS from the Port of Oakland to Hawaii, where it will be trucked to the top of Mauna Kea and lifted into the dome of the Keck II Telescope later this month. Installation and testing of the instrument is likely to take several months. "First light"--the first time astronomers will conduct observations with DEIMOS--is scheduled for June 2, 2002. </p><p>Most of the funding for DEIMOS was provided by the California Association for Research in Astronomy (CARA), a scientific partnership involving the University of California, Caltech, and NASA. CARA operates the Keck Observatory. The National Science Foundation also provided a major grant in support of DEIMOS.</p><p><b>UC Observatories/Lick Observatory</b></p><p>UCO/Lick conducts leading-edge research to answer the most profound questions in observational astronomy.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has awarded them the Newcomb Cleveland Prize, which is given annually to the authors of an outstanding paper published in the association's journal Science. </p><p>The winning paper described in unprecedented detail the structure of the ribosome, a tiny molecular machine crucial to all forms of life. Ribosomes are the protein factories of all living cells. Noller's group used a technique called x-ray crystallography to obtain precise images of the ribosome's structure. It is the largest molecular structure ever solved by x-ray crystallography.</p><p>In addition to Noller, who directs UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, the authors included Marat Yusupov and Gulnara Yusupova, a husband-and-wife team who were visiting researchers in Noller's lab and are now at the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology in Strasbourg, France. The other coauthors and corecipients of the prize are Albion Baucom, a computer specialist in the RNA Center; postdoctoral researcher Kate Lieberman; Thomas Earnest at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and Jamie Cate, now a faculty member at UC Berkeley and formerly a postdoctoral fellow in Noller's lab.</p><p>The Newcomb Cleveland Prize, established in 1923 with funds donated by Newcomb Cleveland of New York City, is the oldest award given by AAAS. Winning papers are chosen for fundamental contributions to basic knowledge or technical achievements of far-reaching consequence.</p><p>A formal presentation of the prize will take place at an awards ceremony and luncheon on Saturday, February 16, at the AAAS annual meeting in Boston. Each of the recipients will receive a bronze medal, travel and hotel expenses to attend the meeting, and a share of the $5,000 prize. </p><p>Noller has been studying the ribosome for more than 30 years.

The database will also be open for public access on the Internet and will be a valuable resource for educators and students.</p><p>"We will obtain long-term data on the coastal environment from a large network of sites," said UCSC programming analyst Lauren Wilkinson, who is in charge of the database and web application. </p><p>Wilkinson and Margaret Dekshenieks, assistant professor of ocean sciences and NEOCO codirector, described the project at the 2002 Ocean Sciences Meeting in Honolulu on February 11. Participating campuses and the observation sites where they will be collecting data for the network include UC Davis (Bodega Head), UC Berkeley (Farallon Islands), UC Santa Barbara (Goleta), UCLA (Santa Monica), UC Irvine (Newport), and UC San Diego, Scripps Institution (La Jolla). John Largier of the Scripps Institution codirects the project with Dekshenieks.</p><p>"This type of broad, interdisciplinary monitoring project is critical for the oceanography community," Wilkinson said.</p><p>The database will provide concurrent physical, chemical, and biological measurements at regular intervals. Data will be collected at the observation sites, checked at Scripps, and sent to UCSC, where it will be made web-accessible in about an hour. </p><p>In its first year, the variables in the NEOCO database will include temperature, density, salinity, conductivity, pressure, and turbidity. The researchers hope to expand the database in the future to include additional parameters. Wilkinson said she also hopes to add graphing capability to the program, which would be an especially useful tool for K-12 teachers. </p><p>NEOCO will eventually link with other environmental monitoring programs. The researchers plan to collect data for decades to come, providing a record of changing coastal conditions over the next century. </p><p>The NEOCO web site is http://es.ucsc.edu/~neoco/.

Miller appointed to fill position of interim director for UC Silicon Valley Center</b></p><p>UC Santa Cruz professor and academic administrator R. Michael Tanner has accepted a position as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), effective July 1, 2002. The appointment was announced today (February 12) by UIC Chancellor Sylvia Manning, following approval by the executive committee of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. The position is the chief academic officer and chief budget officer for UIC. (See UIC press release.)</p><p>Currently, Tanner is professor of computer science and interim director of the UC Silicon Valley Center. UCSC's Vice Chancellor for Research Robert C. Miller, who brings extensive international experience in issues of intellectual property and technology transfer, will assume responsibilities for leading the UC Silicon Valley Center during an interim period.</p><p>"This news generates mixed emotions," commented UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "I congratulate Michael on a wonderful career opportunity, one for which he is eminently well qualified. However, it is a bittersweet moment, because the campus will lose the benefit of his excellent administrative acumen and intellectual leadership--and I will miss working with him as a close colleague and friend."</p><p>Tanner leaves UC Santa Cruz after a distinguished career spanning more than 30 years. He arrived at the campus in 1971, as an assistant professor, having graduated from Stanford University, where he earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering. </p><p>In addition to teaching and research responsibilities, Tanner has held several key administrative posts over the years. From 1981 to 1988, he served as chair of the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. In 1988, he was acting dean of the Natural Sciences Division. In 1989, he became the campus's academic vice chancellor, and in 1992, he was appointed as executive vice chancellor, a position he held until 1998. Tanner was appointed interim director of the UC Silicon Valley Center in August 2000. </p><p>"I feel privileged to have had a long and varied career at this innovative and remarkable UC campus," Tanner notes. "At UC Santa Cruz I have enjoyed the company of exceptional colleagues and stimulating projects for more than three decades. Now, I am eager to tackle the new challenges and meet the wider responsibilities that the University of Illinois at Chicago offers." </p><p>Recognition of Tanner's achievements at UCSC was underscored by Jorge Hankamer, UCSC professor of linguistics and a former dean of humanities, who served in administrative positions that worked closely with Tanner. "Michael provided exemplary leadership during a critical time in the development of the campus," he said. "During his tenure as executive vice chancellor, he guided us through the growth pains of the '90s, despite severe budgetary constraints, and he engineered an orderly transition from a heavily centralized administration to a more distributed and effective one. This shift, which gave divisions and departments greater autonomy and responsibility, was arguably the most significant change in campus operations since its beginning."</p><p>At UIC, working with the vice chancellors for administration, health affairs, student affairs and research, the provost plays a major leadership role in advancing the programs of instruction, research, and service. All the deans, including the deans of the six health sciences colleges, as well as the university librarian and the chief information officer, report to the provost.</p><p>"Michael Tanner's depth and breadth of experience in teaching, research, and administration make him the perfect choice to become UIC's new provost," UIC Chancellor Manning said. "He has excelled throughout his career as a scholar and as an academic leader." </p><p>The University of Illinois at Chicago is a public research university with an annual budget of $1.171 billion and approximately 12,000 faculty and staff. Total enrollment in fall 2001 was 24,530. UIC has 15 academic colleges, including colleges of medicine, dentistry, engineering, liberal arts and sciences, and business administration.</p><p>Tanner's research interests include coding and information theory, computer simulation models, educational uses of information technology, and intellectual property. He holds four patents and is a fellow of the California Council on Science and Technology and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Reporters may contact the University of Illinois at Chicago through Mark Rosati, (312) 996-5546.

Having helped to assemble a working draft of the human genome, he is now deeply involved in efforts to use the information encoded in the genome sequence to transform the practice of medicine and our understanding of biology.</p>
<p>On Thursday, February 28, Haussler will give the 35th annual Faculty Research Lecture at UC Santa Cruz. His talk, entitled "A Working Draft of the Human Genome," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Media Theater on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the general public.</p>
<p>Haussler holds the UC Presidential Chair in Computer Science and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. He is director of the UCSC Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), and was recently appointed associate director of the UC systemwide Insitute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology, and Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3). He was named "2001 Scientist of the Year" by R&amp;D magazine.</p>
<p>For many years, Haussler has been recognized as a leader in the fields of computational learning theory, computational biology, and bioinformatics. At UCSC, one of his most important accomplishments has been to forge deep and fruitful scientific interactions between computer scientists and molecular biologists.</p>
<p>These interdisciplinary interactions at UCSC proved to be crucial to the success of the public Human Genome Project. Through Alan Zahler, an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, Haussler began collaborating with Zahler's graduate student, Jim Kent. In the spring of 2000, Kent created the computer program used to assemble the genome data produced by sequencing labs around the world into the DNA sequences of the human chromosomes. This first working draft of the human genome was completed just days before a carefully orchestrated announcement at the White House.</p>
<p>Haussler's group posted the first working draft of the genome on the World Wide Web and has continued to post regularly updated versions at <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</a>. Molecular biologists and biomedical researchers make more than 50,000 web requests per day for information from this site and its international mirror sites.</p>
<p>Not only is the genome sequence itself available at these sites, but also information on human genes and their variation in the population, their locations in relation to genetic and cytogenetic maps of inherited human diseases, corresponding genes in other species, and dozens of other kinds of information. By providing integration and analysis of this data, the new field of bioinformatics is helping to transform molecular biology and medicine.</p>
<p>Ten years from now, doctors may routinely use genomic data and bioinformatics as part of disease diagnosis and treatment. But along with the promise of dramatically improved health care, this new technology raises important social, ethical, and legal questions. Will the new medicine be broadly available? Will insurers or employers be allowed to discriminate against individuals based on their genetic makeup? How far should people be allowed to go in choosing the genetic attributes of their children?</p>
<p>In his talk, Haussler will discuss the excitement of doing research on the cutting edge of science and technology, as well as the concerns that accompany recent progress in understanding our genetic heritage.</p>
<p>Haussler joined the UCSC faculty in 1986. He earned his B.A. in mathematics from Connecticut College, an M.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bb0a98072704601a012ff2ed9a9c6"><name>66</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From fossils to forensics: UCSC hosts career conference for girls on Saturday, March 2</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1013756400000</start-date><display-name>From fossils to forensics:...</display-name><path>/2002/02/66</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/66</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337910894</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337910894</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Girls in grades 9 to 12 are invited to explore their interests in math, science, and engineering during an exciting career conference at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Saturday, March 2.</p><p>"Expanding Your Horizons in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering" is a daylong event featuring 30 workshops for young women designed to highlight career opportunities in fields as diverse as astronomy, marine biology, environmental science, and medicine.

Highlights include sessions on fossils, forensic anthropology, water monitoring, restoration ecology, careers in biological science, as well as hands-on workshops in electronics, chemistry, medical care, and more.</p><p>The conference is sponsored by the UCSC Women's Center with support from the UCSC Educational Partnership Center.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bb2498072704601a012ff2a5b05c6"><name>67</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New Center for Ocean Health at UCSC's Long Marine Lab emphasizes integration of science and policy</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1014102000000</start-date><display-name>New Center for Ocean...</display-name><path>/2002/02/67</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/67</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337911312</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337911312</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, will dedicate the Center for Ocean Health at the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory on Thursday, February 21. The 23,000-square-foot state-of-the-art research facility was completed last spring and has been occupied since June 2001. </p><p>The Center for Ocean Health serves as a focal point for scientific research, education, and policy programs that address ocean conservation and management issues. By fostering interactions between university researchers, government agencies, and conservation organizations, the center encourages the integration of research and policy efforts to protect and manage marine ecosystems and biodiversity. </p><p>"We are targeting scientific questions that have strong policy implications, where there is a need for solid research to address issues of great importance to the region and the state," said Peter Raimondi, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. </p><p>Raimondi is one of about a dozen faculty and researchers in UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) who moved their offices and laboratories from the main campus to the Center for Ocean Health last year, bringing with them postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and technical support staff. The researchers in the center are primarily involved in studies of marine vertebrates and coastal biology. The center gives them easy access to the other research facilities at Long Marine Lab, including tanks and pools for marine mammals and seawater laboratories for fish, plankton, and marine invertebrates.</p><p>Two nonprofit conservation groups have offices at the Center for Ocean Health: the Nature Conservancy's Coastal Waters Program and the Island Conservation and Ecology Group. Also located nearby are the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, with a university teaching lab and public education programs; the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Santa Cruz Laboratory, where federal scientists are studying major West Coast fisheries; and a marine wildlife center run by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). </p><p>"Having all these other groups around us has led to a lot of dynamic and healthy interactions. It's a really vital and vibrant place to work," Raimondi said.</p><p>"It's been exciting to see the synergy that's developed at the new center," added IMS director Gary Griggs. "Bringing the scientists down here where they can be close to their research and interact with each other has paid off in a lot of ways. This is the first new university research building at the laboratory in 20 years, and combined with the other new state and federal facilities that have relocated to the site, we are becoming a well-recognized center for innovative marine research and education focused on the health of the oceans."</p><p>Raimondi and Mark Carr, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, lead UCSC's participation in the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a large-scale research program that focuses on understanding the nearshore ecosystems of the U.S. West Coast. In many ways, PISCO exemplifies the aim of the Center for Ocean Health to integrate science, policy, and education. The project's findings are applied to issues of ocean conservation and management, and are communicated and shared through public outreach and student-training programs. (Recent findings from PISCO will be presented at a public symposium on March 10 at CSU Monterey Bay.)</p><p>"Some of the most urgent issues in California and throughout the world involve these linkages of science and policy in the coastal zone, because that's where most of the people are and where so many conflicts occur between people and the coastal environment," Raimondi said.</p><p>Michael Beck, director of the Coastal Waters Program for the Nature Conservancy, said his organization's partnership with UCSC is mutually beneficial. </p><p>"I'm able to transfer important new knowledge about marine science from UCSC researchers to the people working at our field sites. We have marine conservation practitioners on the ground in more than 25 countries, from Indonesia to coastal sites throughout the United States, and it's important to connect them with sources of knowledge and expertise," Beck said.</p><p>In return, Beck gives feedback to UCSC scientists about what kinds of information are most needed to improve marine conservation and management efforts. UCSC graduate students and interns work on Nature Conservancy projects, gaining firsthand experience with marine conservation issues.</p><p>"There are few places in the world where there is such good synergy between scientists, managers, conservationists, and public educators working to understand and preserve marine diversity," Beck said.</p><p>The Island Conservation and Ecology Group (ICEG) also has a close relationship with the IMS. Founded in 1994 by Donald Croll, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and IMS researcher Bernie Tershy, ICEG is primarily concerned with problems caused by introduced species on islands. For example, the group is helping to save breeding colonies of marine birds that are threatened by introduced rats and other exotic species on coastal islands of Mexico and California. ICEG works with UCSC scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students involved in research projects related to the group's goals.</p><p>"From the university's perspective, it gives students an opportunity to do conservation science, and for ICEG, it enables us to do studies that we wouldn't otherwise be able to do," Croll said.</p><p>UCSC researchers and students also work with scientists at the state and federal laboratories adjacent to Long Marine Lab. Churchill Grimes, director of the NMFS lab, noted that cooperative research projects involving NMFS and UCSC scientists are currently supported by $1.2 million in federal funds.</p><p>The NMFS lab, overseen by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is also home to NOAA's Institute for Marine Protected Area Science, established as part of a national effort to create a scientifically based, comprehensive national system of protected areas representing diverse U.S. marine ecosystems.</p><p>"We are in the middle of the nation's largest marine sanctuary here in Monterey Bay, with a national center at the NMFS lab that's looking at how to use protected areas to conserve marine resources, and the IMS is doing research that's helping them understand how to do this. All these things are complementary," Griggs said.</p><p>The Center for Ocean Health draws on the full range of expertise in the Institute of Marine Sciences. With 43 affiliated faculty and over 50 professional and postdoctoral researchers, the IMS is known for cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in environmental toxicology, marine mammal biology, nearshore ecological processes, marine biogeochemistry, paleoceanography, and continental margin geology.</p><p>Construction of the Center for Ocean Health was largely funded by a $5 million grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Griggs at (831) 459-5006 or <a href="mailto:griggs@cats.ucsc.edu">griggs@cats.ucsc.edu</a> and Raimondi at (831) 459-5674 or <a href="mailto:raimondi@biology.ucsc.edu">raimondi@biology.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bb3a68072704601a012ff9f93a194"><name>68</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New books on genetic engineering reveal troubling gaps in what we know</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1014274800000</start-date><display-name>New books on genetic...</display-name><path>/2002/02/68</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/68</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337911645</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337911645</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The National Academy of Sciences published a major report today (February 21) on the environmental effects of genetically modified plants. Deborah Letourneau, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a leading authority on this controversial new technology, contributed to the NAS report and coedited another just-published volume on genetically engineered organisms.</p>
<p>As an expert on the academy's 12-member National Research Council Sub-Committee on Environmental Consequences of Genetically Modified Plants, Letourneau contributed to the new book, <em>Environmental Effects of Transgenic Plants: The Scope and Adequacy of Regulation</em> (Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 2002). Letourneau's focus was to examine how well the U.S. government is regulating transgenic crops to avoid any negative effects.</p>
<p>In the other new book, <em>Genetically Engineered Organisms: Assessing Environmental and Human Health Effects</em> (Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 2002), Letourneau and coeditor Beth Burrows, president and director of the Edmonds Institute in Edmonds, Washington, present worrisome gaps in knowledge about the long-term effects of genetic engineering and call for more extensive and rigorous examination of the potential impacts of genetically modified plants and other organisms. Contributions by prominent researchers showcase the many unanswered questions that weaken assessments of biosafety.</p>
<p>"There is a disjuncture between the people creating the products of genetic engineering and the knowledge of evolutionary biologists and ecologists," said Letourneau. "Like many ecologists, I've been trying to inform the public about the effectiveness and possible environmental and human-health impacts of genetically engineered organisms."</p>
<p>For several years, Letourneau has put aside her own work on insect-plant interactions to lead the call for more research on genetic modification of plants and other organisms. Letourneau is hopeful that more research will stimulate a fuller evaluation of the benefits and risks of genetic modification.</p>
<p>Among the issues discussed in Genetically Engineered Organisms are:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>New research that indicates how potentially misleading it can be to use average distances to estimate hybridization rates between transgenic crops and their wild relatives. "We're underestimating possible risk by concentrating on the average hybridization distances," said Letourneau.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>New evidence suggests that genetically modified, or transgenic, plants might hybridize at higher rates than "equivalent" nontransgenic plants that were conventionally bred for herbicide resistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture seeks "equivalent" products, but these findings point out a significant difference between transgenic and nontransgenic plants.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>Unintended consequences of genetic modification could include local extinction of some species. For example, transgenic salmon that are made to grow faster by expression of a growth-hormone gene might be more attractive to predators, and the species could be vulnerable to a population crash.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">


</li>
<li>More needs to be known about the "driver mechanisms" of genetically modified organisms before the technology is widely introduced. Introduction of a transgenic malaria-resistant mosquito in an area plagued by an epidemic, for example, would help tremendously in the short run but could have potentially devastating unintended public-health consequences if human immunity levels fall, as would be expected, and the driver mechanism of the transgenic mosquito subsequently fails.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Despite such broad gaps in current knowledge, commercial application of genetically engineered plants has become widespread in the United States and other countries. According to Letourneau, transgenic corn accounts for about 26 percent of worldwide corn production. Transgenic corn contains the toxin of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) soil bacterium, which disrupts the digestive system of a caterpillar. Cotton and potatoes have also been modified to produce Bt toxin, while other crops, such as soybeans, have been modified to resist the herbicide Roundup.</p>
<p>Marketed to farmers as tools to ensure higher yields, transgenic crops are being touted as a breakthrough strategy to help feed the world's fast-growing population. But ecologists worry about potential unintended effects of genetic engineering, such as the nontarget impact Bt corn pollen was found to have on Monarch butterflies. In 1999, Cornell University researchers reported Monarch caterpillars that were fed milkweed dusted with pollen from Bt corn grew more slowly and suffered higher mortality rates than those fed milkweed dusted by pollen from untransformed corn or milkweed free of pollen. The wider implications of such nontarget effects are discussed by the Cornell researchers in a chapter of the new book.</p>
<p>Regulatory agencies and companies developing genetically modified organisms have a responsibility to be accountable to the public, said Letourneau, but companies are held to a lower research standard than are peer-reviewed academic researchers. In addition, industry findings are often protected as proprietary information, which makes it impossible for Letourneau and other outside scientists to evaluate the quality and scope of in-house research.</p>
<p>"U.S. regulatory agencies typically rely almost entirely on data submitted by the companies themselves," said Letourneau. "Even when I've been asked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to review the findings, I can't get access to them. Companies may be doing a good job, but it's hard to tell."</p>
<p>"People don't know the in's and out's of genetic engineering, but they remember the Ford Pinto," she said. "Credibility is really important, and companies and regulatory agencies need to build it."</p>

The Complete Satyajit Ray: Cinema Through the Inner Eye, which includes more than 35 feature films and documentaries produced from 1955 to 1991, opens in Washington, D.C., on March 1. Twenty films from the retrospective will also be shown in Los Angeles, CA.</p><p>Ray was fatally ill with heart disease and hospitalized in his hometown of Calcutta, India, in January of 1992, when he received a visitor from America, longtime family friend Dilip Basu. Basu was shocked to discover how ill Ray had become.</p><p>"He could see the sadness on my face," said Basu, "and I think out of kindness, to distract me, he said, 'Dilip, you remember you talked about making an archive of my work? I want you to do that.' Of course I promised I would."</p><p>After Ray's death in April 1992, Basu established the Ray Film and Study Collection (Ray FASC) at UC Santa Cruz, where Basu is a professor in the History Department. Backed by an advisory council which includes renowned director Martin Scorsese, Basu began assembling Ray's archive, currently comprising more than 10,000 items, including Ray's notes and sketchbooks for his films, stills, posters and articles about Ray. The archive resides in McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>A prolific writer, Ray authored 75 novels. But he is best known internationally as an auteur-style filmmaker. Ray wrote, produced, directed, and edited his movies; acted as director of photography for his films; scored music for those made from 1962 on; laid out the films scene-by-scene in his own storyboard drawings; and even designed publicity posters. </p><p>Collecting and restoring Ray's film negatives--the originals were found to be in critical condition--is painstaking and costly work. Basu has received grants in support of the project, including one from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p><p>"Nobody believed it could all be done," said Basu, who has been directing the Ray FASC while maintaining his teaching schedule. He has found himself working weekends in Los Angeles at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences labs and studios, translating dialogue to create new subtitles, then rushing back to Santa Cruz to teach during the week. After nearly a decade of work, Ray FASC has completed restoration of 11 films. </p><p>These films, in addition to unrestored movies, will be shown at The Complete Satyajit Ray: Cinema Through the Inner Eye. "We wanted to show everything," said Basu, "and also to make a point about the need for restoration." Because of the number of films, the retrospective screenings will be held at several venues, including the Freer Gallery of Art, the National Gallery of Art, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts.</p><p>Two major stars of Ray's films--Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore--will be featured speakers during the retrospective. Other speakers include distinguished Indian film directors Shyam Benegal and Mira Nair and American director Gregory Nava. </p><p>For more information on screenings of The Complete Satyajit Ray: Cinema Through the Inner Eye, see these web sites:</p><p><a href="http://www.nga.gov/programs/flmray.htm">http://www.nga.gov/programs/flmray.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/programs/film.htm">http://www.asia.si.edu/programs/film.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.nmwa.org/calendar/edevents.htm#eye">http://www.nmwa.org/calendar/edevents.htm#eye</a></p><p>From March 30 to April 28, 2002, 20 films from the retrospective will be shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, CA.

<p>"Without any question, they represent the spirit and culture of Tibet at its highest level."</p>
<p>--Philip Glass, composer</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents the beautiful and spiritual Tantric chanting of the Gyuto Monks of Tibet at the UC Santa Cruz Music Center Recital Hall on Wednesday, March 27, and Thursday, March 28, 2002 at 8:00pm. Don't miss this rare opportunity to see the Gyuto Monks during their special 2002 West Coast tour.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The liturgical arts of Tibetan Buddhism, developing for centuries in relative isolation on the high plateaus of a mountain-ringed land, are extraordinarily rich and beautiful. The Tantric texts of Gyuto performed by the Monks create, through musical prayer, and spiritual dedication, an awe-inspiring world of enlightenment and bliss.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>After hearing the extraordinary multiphonic chanting of the Gyuto Monks in 1987, Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart resolved to bring the monks to America and make them known to a wider audience. In addition to their own two recordings produced by Hart, the music of the Gyuto monks can be heard on the film soundtracks of Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet.</p>
<p>Many varied Buddhist traditions of India have been preserved only in Tibet, and are therefore a cultural treasure of mankind. Distinct sects and traditions developed in Tibet and now coexist in exile: that of the Gyuto Tantric College/Monastery is one of the most esoteric, complex and awe inspiring. For 500 years, the Gyuto college prospered at the National Cathedral in Lhasa with 900 or more monks in residence. Now exiled to India by the Chinese annexation of Tibet, the Gyuto leaders have reestablished a monastery near Bomdi-La, India.</p>
<p>Preparation for membership in a monastic order normally begins in childhood and requires many years of training. This training includes memorization of extensive liturgical texts, learning yogic techniques of meditation and visualization, and the cultivation of one or more liturgical arts.</p>

<p>". . . an exceptionally vivid contribution to documentary theater."-</p>
<p>--The New York Times</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents the remarkable theatrical work of Collective: Unconscious in their award-winning Charlie, Victor, Romeo, on Tuesday, March 26 and Wednesday, March 27, 2002 at 8:00pm at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage. This riveting dramatic work for the stage is derived entirely from the "black box" cockpit voice recorder transcripts of six major real-life airline emergencies. Made even more poignant by the tragic events of September 11, this unique performance offers an insightful glimpse into decision making and human interaction under intense pressure.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Called "a remarkable performance" by Flying Magazine, the painstakingly researched, produced and directed Charlie, Victor, Romeo allows audience members to enter into the tension filled cockpit of real in-flight emergencies. What the audience witnesses are remarkable portraits of courage, human frailty, and grace under fire. Presented by request to groups ranging from healthcare and flying professionals to West Point students and members of the US Air Force Charlie, Victor, Romeo is not only an exceptional theatrical piece: "It has lessons in it that are universal." -Col. Jim Brooks, Chief of Operational Training, USAF, Air Force Times. Charlie Victor Romeo "is about the triumph of the human spirit, and calm in the middle of chaos."-The New York Times.</p>
<p>The audience is invited to stay after the performance for a Meet-the-Artist discussion!</p>
<p>For more information about the play, and for the company's statement regarding the new meaning this play has taken on since September 11, visit the Charlie, Victor, Romeo web site at: www.charlievictorromeo.com.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>Charlie Victor Romeo has won a number of awards including two Drama Desk awards, two New York International Fringe Festival awards and the Grand Prize at the Absolut Angel Arts and Technology Awards, all in 2000; and an award for sound design this year at the Backstage West Garland Awards. Collective: Unconscious called itself "a confederation of artists" working in the visual and performing arts. It defines itself as "first and foremost an experimental theater." It runs a theater, rehearsal, and gallery space which is open to the artistic community at large, and it works to support the original work of its fifteen member/administrators. Since its founding in 1995, Collective: Unconscious has produced dozens of performances at its own space on Ludlow Street in New York City and other at other locations.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents A Traveling Jewish Theatre in God's Donkey: A Play on Moses on Saturday April 6, 2002 at 8pm and Sunday, April 7, 2002 at 3pm at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage. Re-visioning the story of Moses, God's Donkey questions the "conventional wisdom" that has, from this ensemble's perspective, encumbered the narrative for centuries. Examining the most basic assumptions of the modern world-view, the existence of history, national identity, individual choice and the uniqueness of individual experience, A Traveling Jewish Theatre finds connections where others see division. Digging into a variety of biblical translations and commentaries the company presents a wealth of surprising and revelatory images which are powerful, refreshing and full of humor. Using burlap, head scarves, a couple of rocks and a few other minimal costumes and props, Aaron Davidman and Eric Rhys Miller transform themselves in this two-man performance into multiple characters, including God in sunglasses, a daunted Moses, a kvetching slave, a midwife and other figures. Daniel Hoffman's live music sets the tone and lends to the expressive range and emotional pull of the play with feverish fiddle solos, blues on electric guitar, Hebrew chants and Broadway-style production numbers (Hoffman also enters the stage, becoming a powerful third "voice"). God's Donkey was co-written by Aaron Davidman, Eric Rhys Miller and the play's director Corey Fisher.</p>
<p>The audience is invited to stay after the performances for Meet-the-Artist discussions.</p>
<p>This presentation supported in part by Ow Family Properties.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>Now in its 21st season, A Traveling Jewish Theatre (ATJT) is a unique artist-led ensemble that has created a body of work which defies categorization. In the polyglot tradition of Jewish culture, the company speaks many languages. It speaks poetry and it speaks story. It speaks secular Yiddish humanism and ecstatic mysticism. It speaks world history and women's wisdom. It speaks jazz and sacred chant. It speaks Jewish and it speaks American. Since its founding in 1978 ATJT has created 12 original works for the theatre, the sources for which have ranged from the legends of the Hasidim to the assassination of Trotsky; from Yiddish poetry to the reclamation of women's wisdom; from the healing nature of storytelling to the challenge of interfaith marriage and from the politics of the Middle East to African-American/Jewish relations. Searching for the living images that burn themselves into our consciousness, ATJT avoids dealing with social or political issues in isolation. It recognizes that the roots of theatre lie in the realm of the mythic, the sacred and the communal; and that theatre can be an instrument of healing for people and cultures.</p>

The award consists of a prize and a one-year fellowship. GuhaThakurta will spend his fellowship year at NRC's Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Victoria, British Columbia.</p><p>"I'm really happy and totally surprised," said GuhaThakurta, who was honored at NRC's annual awards dinner and ceremony on February 20 in Ottawa.</p><p>GuhaThakurta earned international renown in the field of astrophysics for his influential work on a wide range of subjects, including interstellar dust, dark matter, planets, supernovae, and globular star clusters. His current focus is understanding how galaxies formed. GuhaThakurta charts the history of our galaxy, the Milky Way, by observing its closest relative, the nearby Andromeda galaxy. </p><p>"There are no mirrors in astronomy to tell us what the Milky Way looks like from the outside," said GuhaThakurta. The next best thing to looking in a mirror, he said, is looking at a close relative. Andromeda is a bigger version of the spiral-shaped Milky Way and, at a distance of two million light-years, is also its cosmic neighbor.</p><p>GuhaThakurta tracks individual stars in the Andromeda galaxy using the Keck Telescope in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope. An instrument called a spectrograph separates the light from each star into its basic colors, like a prism. These colors tell the story of the star: its temperature, how fast it's moving, and its chemical makeup. </p><p>"It's pretty remarkable that light from a star two million light-years away can tell us so much about the evolutionary state of the star," GuhaThakurta said. </p><p>Stars are mainly hydrogen and helium, the simplest elements in the universe. But they make small amounts of heavier elements, such as calcium, during their lifetimes via the nuclear fusion reactions that cause stars to shine. When massive stars finally die in a grand explosion called a supernova, they inject these elements into their surroundings. </p><p>"The next generation of stars is born with these pollutants," GuhaThakurta said. The process then perpetuates: When some of these baby stars grow up and explode, they transmit the traces of their ancestors, along with newly made chemicals, to the next generation. Like traits in a pedigree, the amounts of metals in a star tell us about its ancestry.</p><p>What's surprising is that when GuhaThakurta examined 100 stars in a small area of Andromeda, their chemical tags were so diverse that he concluded the stars must have formed in different places and at different times. </p><p>"Andromeda's halo of stars appears to be the result of the smooshing together of many small galaxies, and the same process probably formed the Milky Way's halo," GuhaThakurta said.</p><p>During his fellowship at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, GuhaThakurta will use the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope to continue his detailed survey of Andromeda. This telescope will provide complementary data to the Keck and Hubble telescopes. GuhaThakurta will begin his fellowship in summer 2002.</p><p>GuhaThakurta previously received a Hubble Fellowship, widely considered to be the most prestigious postdoctoral fellowship in international astronomy, and was an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow through 2001.</p><p>The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) established the international Herzberg Memorial Prize and Fellowship Award in 1999 to commemorate the late Gerhard Herzberg, NRC scientist and Nobel laureate known worldwide as the "father of modern molecular spectroscopy." This prestigious honor is given annually to an active researcher who has distinguished himself or herself through many years of outstanding achievements in a field that is relevant to NRC's programs.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact GuhaThakurta at (831) 459-5169 or raja@ucolick.org.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bbe378072704601a012ff1b77e186"><name>76</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine scientists will hold a public symposium on coastal ecosystems on Sunday, March 10</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1014706800000</start-date><display-name>Marine scientists will hold...</display-name><path>/2002/02/76</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/02/76</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337914368</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337914368</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Marine scientists involved in a major study of coastal ecosystems on the West Coast are hosting a Public Symposium on Sunday, March 10, to present findings from their first three years of research. Researchers, managers, ocean enthusiasts, and the general public are invited to attend and learn about recent progress from the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). </p><p>The symposium will take place from 12 noon to 5 p.m. at California State University, Monterey Bay, in the University Center on Sixth Avenue. Registration is free at the event; no preregistration is necessary.</p><p>PISCO involves researchers from four major universities in California and Oregon and is dedicated to advancing the understanding of shallow-water, rocky-shore ecosystems along the West Coast of the United States. PISCO's partner institutions are the University of California, Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon State University, and Stanford University, Hopkins Marine Station.</p><p>The symposium will include informative presentations by well-known marine scientists; an array of posters highlighting PISCO research along the West Coast; and opportunities to ask questions and share ideas with PISCO scientists.</p><p>Speakers will include PISCO principal investigators Peter Raimondi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz; Bill Douros, superintendent of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; George Somero, director of the Hopkins Marine Station and a PISCO principal investigator; and Jenn Caselle, PISCO science coordinator, UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>For more information, contact Lydia Bergen, PISCO policy coordinator at UCSC, at (831) 459-5022 or bergen@biology.ucsc.edu.
