Dasmann, a founder of international environmentalism and a professor emeritus of ecology at UC Santa Cruz, died Tuesday, November 5, in Santa Cruz. Dasmann had been in ill health for several years. The cause of death was pneumonia. He was 83. </p><p>	Dasmann was the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Destruction of California</i> (1965), <i>Environmental Conservation</i> (fifth edition 1984), <i>Wildlife Biology</i> (second edition 1981), and <i>California's Changing Environment</i> (1981). A visionary environmentalist, Dasmann began working as a conservation biologist in the 1950s when the field was just emerging, identifying the major threats of population growth, pollution, habitat loss, and species eradication that would become the focus of international conservation efforts for decades to come.	</p><p>	Dasmann made an impassioned plea for sustainability on a planet with limited resources. In addition to his academic career, Dasmann did pioneering work in the 1960s with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), where he helped launch the Man and the Biosphere program. For most of the 1970s, he worked in Switzerland as a senior ecologist for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p><p>	Dasmann's efforts earned him many major international awards, including the top conservation medals of the World Wildlife Society and the Smithsonian Institution. The prestigious Order of the Golden Ark, which recognizes the world's most distinguished conservationists, was bestowed on Dasmann by the Dutch government in 1978. He became an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1984 and received the Distinguished Service Award from the Society for Conservation Biology in 1988. </p><p>	Born in San Francisco, Dasmann was fascinated by wildlife from an early age. His college education in biology was interrupted by World War II; he served in New Guinea and Australia, where he met his wife of 45 years, Elizabeth Sheldon. Soon after his return to the United States, Dasmann enrolled at UC Berkeley to study zoology under famed wildlife biologist Starker Leopold. He received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Berkeley, and in 1954 embarked on a distinguished career in teaching, research, and public service. Other than a brief appointment at the University of Minnesota, Dasmann's academic roots remained planted in California soil. He was a professor of wildlife management at Humboldt State University for eight years before joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1977. He retired from UCSC in 1989.</p><p>  	Dasmann's talent for outstanding scientific research was matched by his desire to change the world. A gifted writer, Dasmann was equally at home in the field, the classroom, and the policy arena. He translated his passion for nature into a vision of planet preservation years before the public began to grapple with concepts like conservation and overpopulation.</p><p>	Dasmann's research took him to Africa, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean, and California. He was an early advocate of conservation policies that respected the knowledge and circumstances of indigenous people, and his early call for a vision of bioregionalism that minimized human impact on the land helped lay the groundwork for the field of environmental ethics. Dasmann fought for the title of his influential text Environmental Conservation at a time when the phrase was unknown, and his pioneering work on game ranching in Africa fostered the field of ecodevelopment and helped make ecotourism a household word.</p><p>	Earlier this year, Dasmann published his memoir, <i>Called by the Wild: The Autobiography of a Conservationist</i>  (Berkeley, CA: University of California, Press, 2002). The book reflects Dasmann's desire to give credit to others, but in fact Dasmann is one of a handful of visionaries who gave life to the worldwide environmental movement. </p><p>	Although informed by complex scientific observations, Dasmann's vision of conservation was based on one simple fact: Resources are finite. Yet successful conservation strategies aren't simple, and Dasmann always fought for policies that took into account the full complexities of biology. At the Conservation Foundation, he recalled recently, a senior official was always chastising Dasmann, saying "Dammit, Dasmann, you keep making things too complicated! We're just trying to get some land set aside, and you keep adding all these complications!"</p><p>	The public-relations challenges environmentalists face today are similar to those Dasmann faced as a graduate student studying deer populations in northern California. Despite convincing data that predicted a population crash unless the number of deer was reduced, preferably by liberalizing hunting regulations, Dasmann and his colleagues were unable to build the necessary public support among deer hunters, who believed a doe hunt would lead to extinction. As a result, the deer population did indeed crash in the mid-1960s. </p><p>	For Dasmann, like many scientific researchers committed to using research to inform public policy, the challenge of swaying public opinion persisted throughout his career. There was little satisfaction in being able to say, "I told you so." </p><p>	"I'm not much for tying myself to trees or putting sand in gasoline tanks, but my feeling is that we need some fairly radical social and economic restructuring to address some of these issues," Dasmann said during a 1989 interview. "I'm a tentative optimist, but I can't see any rational basis for my optimism sometimes."</p><p>	Dasmann's most recent efforts focused on creation of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/ggbr/ggbr.htm">Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve (GGBR)</a>, one of 300 international sites designated by the United Nations for protection and access. The GGBR consists of more than two million acres that extend from the Bodega Marine Laboratory north of San Francisco to Jasper Ridge near Stanford University and 30 miles offshore to the edge of the Continental Shelf. The reserve is managed by nine separate entities, each of which helps protect the wide variety of native species and natural habitats that characterize the coastal region of central California while offering recreational and educational opportunities for many millions of visitors.</p><p>	Dasmann is survived by his daughters Marlene Dasmann of Santa Cruz, Sandra Dasmann of Santa Cruz, and Lauren Chamberlain of Tucson, Arizona; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. His wife, Elizabeth Sheldon Dasmann, died in 1996.</p><p>	A memorial service is pending. Contributions in Dasmann's memory may be sent to the attention of Lia Hull at the Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve Association, Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5020.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c6da58072704601a012ff62db4c97"><name>250</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Author Ruben Martinez discusses migration in the global context on Nov. 12 in Santa Cruz</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Martinez, Ruben Martinez, CJTC, Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community</keywords><start-date>1036652400000</start-date><display-name>Author Ruben Martinez discusses...</display-name><path>/2002/11/250</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/250</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337959284</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337959284</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ruben Martinez, author of <i>The Other Side: Notes from the New L.A., Mexico City, and Beyond,</i> will give a free public lecture about migrants entitled "Strangers No More: How the Newest Americans will Redefine America" on Tuesday, November 12, at 7 p.m. in Holy Cross Hall, 170 High Street in Santa Cruz.</p><p>	Martinez, an associate editor at Pacific News Service, has appeared as a commentator on CNN, Frontline, Nightline, and All Things Considered. He is the author of the new book Crossing Over, which looks at Mexican migration through the lens of the Chavez family of Cheran, Michoacan, Mexico.

Since its earliest days, Santa Cruz has drawn countless tourists, entrepreneurs, and visionaries to spend time at the beach, the Boardwalk, or their family cabin in the woods. </p><p>A new book by Sheila O'Hare and Irene Berry--both librarians at McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz--captures a visual history of this quintessential California resort town, utilizing more than 200 photographs from the University Library's Special Collections. </p><p>Published by Arcadia as part of its Images in America series, <i>Santa Cruz, California,</i> features a variety of rarely seen images that begin in 1860 and end with the tourist trade of the late 20th century.</p><p>"People tend to use the same images of Santa Cruz all the time," Berry noted. "I knew the collection at the UCSC library very well, and I knew there were photos that had never been used before. We even had collections of negatives that hadn't been developed."</p><p>The book includes photographs of the city's classic seaside amusement park, along with images of early silent-movie making, therapeutic baths and sanitariums, earthquakes and floods, the building of infamous Highway 17, and the early era of tourism. The cover is a shot of a 1950s crowded beach scene below the Boardwalk that has never been commercially reproduced.</p><p>"There's also a very interesting photo from the early '30s that was taken at the corner of Soquel and Pacific downtown--where the Gap store is now," Berry said. "It's an image of a street musician with a dancing dog. The Del Mar Theater is in the background and you have men in hats and women in cloth coats. Except for the clothing, it looks like it could have been taken this morning, but it was really from a different era. I wanted to show what it said about the town, that nothing changes really."</p><p>The authors did a great deal of research for the project, cross-referencing photographs with issues of old newspapers including the Santa Cruz Surf and the Sentinel. But they didn't shy away from the grittier aspects of the city.</p><p>"We wanted to present a view of Santa Cruz that is affectionate, but not smarmy," O'Hare explained. "We didn't want to whitewash the town, so we included material about crime, controversial urban-planning issues, and eccentric characters that lived here. Some of my favorite photos are from the mug books--the arrest records of Santa Cruz. They depict people you don't normally find in the traditional record. It's unusual, but it makes the book more historically accurate."</p><p>Both O'Hare and Berry agreed that Santa Cruz was an ideal subject for a book because it has such a varied past and UCSC has such an extensive collection of photos. </p><p>"Santa Cruz is very important because it has been the destination of so many people from so many places around the state," Berry noted. "People have a sense of ownership about Santa Cruz because of their fond memories of the area. Its economy is driven by these people."</p><p>O'Hare stressed that the book contains enough varied information to appeal to both visitors, locals, and those interested in California history. She added that it also reflects a wealth of material stored in Special Collections at UCSC that is relatively untapped. </p><p>"It's important to remember that these photographs in the library are available to the public," Berry said. "The materials we used in the book are from a working collection, not something that sits behind glass in a museum."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c70688072704601a012ffb5605aee"><name>252</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC faculty members receive Fulbright Scholar Awards</title><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Kathy Foley, Hi Kyung Kim, Fulbright</keywords><start-date>1037257200000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC faculty members...</display-name><path>/2002/11/252</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/252</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337959974</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337959974</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two faculty members at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have been honored with Fulbright Scholar Awards for the 2002-03 academic year. </p><p>	 Kathy Foley, professor of theater arts, and Hi Kyung Kim, associate professor of music, join approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad to 140 countries over the next year through the Fulbright Scholarship Program.</p><p> The purpose of the program, established by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, is to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and countries around the world. Fulbright Scholars are chosen on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership potential in their field. The program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.   </p><p>Foley will travel to Indonesia this spring to gather information for a book on the relationship between Indonesian puppet-style performance and mask presentation, with special focus on Bali, Java, and Sunda. Her research will include interviews with puppeteers, dancers, and scholars, as well as written sources and observation of performance practice.</p><p>"It's like being a detective," Foley observed. "It's going after the remaining evidence that's embedded in stories, rituals, and initiation ceremonies in performance that make Indonesian puppetry--philosophically and theatrically--a different art form than that found in the West." </p><p>Foley has been a master of the rod puppet theater of West Java for 20 years. Her performances have been featured on Indonesian television, and she has presented exhibitions of her work regularly at museums and festivals throughout the country. An overview of her research will be presented in a future issue of the Asian Theatre Journal, and an exhibition of masks and puppets will open at UCSC in 2004 before moving on to various museums around the United States. </p><p>As part of her Fulbright Scholarship grant, Hi Kyung Kim traveled to Korea in October to teach two courses at the College of Music at Seoul National University, conduct research on Korean vocal art songs, and do fieldwork on the Shamanistic Funeral March.</p><p> She also presented a recital of her own music at the National Center for the Korean Traditional Performing Arts, sponsored by Fulbright Korea and Seoul National University. The program included the world premiere of a work she composed shortly after she arrived in Korea-- Trio SORI, for Korean bamboo flute, clarinet, and cello.</p><p>	Kim is additionally working on several composition projects in Korea, including Isle of Eeo, a collaborative work with noted Korean poet Ko Un, commissioned by the Koussevitzky Foundation at the Library of Congress, for voice and chamber ensemble.</p><p>	Before traveling to Korea, Kim completed a piece commissioned by Meet the Composer, Yo-Yo Ma, and the Chamber Music Society of Minnesota for a special project Commemorating World War II, as well as a composition written for the Alexander String Quartet. She also composed a work for Korean traditional choreography, drumming, and chamber ensemble for the Other Minds Festival in San Francisco, as well as a piece for percussion duo for the New Music Ensemble at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. </p><p>Kim's composition for solo flute was recently selected as best written piece at the 2002 Australian Flute Festival in Melbourne.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c71f38072704601a012ff1a98a76c"><name>253</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Wind Ensemble to perform in Australia at Sydney Opera House</title><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Wind Ensemble, Wind Ensemble, International Music Festival</keywords><start-date>1037257200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Wind Ensemble to...</display-name><path>/2002/11/253</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/253</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337960385</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337960385</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Wind Ensemble has been invited to represent the United States at the 2003 International Music Festival to be held next June at the renowned Opera House in Sydney, Australia. </p><p>An offshoot of the 1986 World Expo held in Brisbane, the festival brings a variety of concert bands, choirs, orchestras, jazz, and string ensembles to perform in a week of festivities--beginning in Canberra, the capital of Australia, and culminating with a performance at the 2600-seat Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House.</p><p>"The festival draws from countries across the Pacific Rim, including the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore," noted Phillip Hobson, operations manager for World Projects International, the festival producer. "We've had groups from Japan, Taiwan, and China participate as well. It changes every year."</p><p>Under the direction of Robert Klevan, a music lecturer at UCSC, the Wind Ensemble performed in 2001 at Carnegie Hall. </p><p>"We received a standing ovation from an audience of strangers at Carnegie Hall," Klevan said. "It was thrilling. Our ensemble never played as well as they did that day."</p><p>	That appearance led to several inquiries from other venues and festivals, including World Projects International.</p><p>	"They sent a representative out to hear us, based on our audition tape," Klevan noted. "Right after our rehearsal, he said: you're the one.'"</p><p>	The 67-member Wind Ensemble will perform an hour-long set at the Opera House featuring Suite Francais by Darius Milhaud and David Stanhope's Folk Songs for Band. Founded in the fall of 1998 with only 18 members, the group performed the national anthem at a San Francisco Giants game that year, and then set its sights higher.</p><p>	"They've come so far in such a short time.I'm very excited about that and the way they represent the university and the state," Klevan said.

The center will use new technological approaches to study the processes driving the highly productive coastal upwelling ecosystems along the California coast. The aim is to establish the scientific basis for effective monitoring and management of these ecosystems and the fisheries and other resources associated with them. </p><p>The center brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from five partner institutions around Monterey Bay, with UCSC as the lead institution. The other partners are the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Laboratory in Santa Cruz. The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is also involved, said Gary Griggs, a principal investigator on the grant and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences. </p><p>"Our goal is to develop an integrated view of these highly productive coastal ecosystems, using the Monterey Bay sanctuary as kind of a big laboratory," Griggs said. </p><p>"Part of the project will be to put all the data together in a way that is accessible and can be visualized, both for scientists and for public user groups," he added.</p><p>The California coast is one of just five major coastal upwelling regions in the world. While they make up only one-tenth of a percent of the ocean's surface area, upwelling regions account for 95 percent of the global marine biomass and more than 21 percent of the world's fisheries landings. </p><p>Despite the ecological and economic importance of coastal upwelling centers, scientists have only a rudimentary understanding of how coastal upwelling fuels the engines of productivity associated with them, said Donald Croll, a principal investigator on the grant and assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p><p>The Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT) will help scientists understand how key marine resources--including fisheries, seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles--respond to short-term and long-term changes in oceanographic processes, Croll said.</p><p>The codirectors of the center are Margaret McManus, assistant professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, and Jeffrey Paduan, associate professor of oceanography at the Naval Postgraduate School and an associate adjunct professor of ocean sciences at UCSC. </p><p>"We are primarily interested in the upwelling plume and how it affects the ecosystems. Eventually the goal is to visualize this in three dimensions and see how it changes over time," McManus said. </p><p>The research on ecosystem dynamics will be supported by efforts to develop improved mooring-based monitoring systems and new systems for data management and visualization, she said. MBARI operates a system of mooring-based instruments that monitor conditions in Monterey Bay, and is working to upgrade and expand this system. Other sources of data include remote-sensing satellites, shore-based measurements, and regular cruises aboard research vessels to monitor oceanographic conditions and the distribution and abundance of nutrients, plankton, fish, and other marine life.</p><p>McManus, who oversees the data and visualization group, emphasized that new visualization tools will be needed to meet the demands of scientists, resource managers, and the public. McManus has experience with these issues as coordinator of the Network for Environmental Observation of the Coastal Ocean (NEOCO), which integrates oceanographic data from seven UC research sites along the California coast.</p><p>"We will be using some of the NEOCO data, but the CIMT project is more focused on the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary," she said. "The great thing about the center is that it is bringing together partners from around Monterey Bay who are studying different aspects of the same problem."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: To contact Gary Griggs or Margaret McManus, call Alex Gramond at (831) 459-2464 or e-mail agramond@ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c74518072704601a012ffc185ce81"><name>255</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz workshop on climate change and water resources brings together scientists and water agencies</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Climate change, water resources, STEPS, STEPS Institute, Brent Haddad</keywords><start-date>1037257200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz workshop...</display-name><path>/2002/11/255</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/255</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337960990</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337960990</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Representatives of state and regional water agencies joined climate researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, last week to discuss "Climate Change and Water Resources Planning." The meeting was the first of a series of workshops being organized by UCSC's STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research. The workshops will address a variety of issues where there is a need to integrate science, technology, engineering, policy, and society (the "STEPS" approach).</p><p>The main purpose of last week's meeting was to establish a dialogue between scientists who study regional climate change and the agencies that manage California's water resources, said Brent Haddad, associate professor of environmental studies and associate director of the STEPS Institute. </p><p>"The time has come to have this discussion, and UC Santa Cruz is uniquely qualified to lead it," Haddad said. "We have the leading scientists in a number of areas related to regional climate change impacts, as well as a campuswide research commitment in this area." </p><p>Almost all of the major state and regional water agencies in California were represented at the meeting, including the State Department of Water Resources, the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the Imperial Irrigation District. Representatives of federal agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey also attended.</p><p>"The purpose of this meeting is to take the results of climate change research from the university and make it available to water resource managers in a way that they can use," Haddad said. "That requires a dialogue, because we need to understand how their decisions are made, and they need to get a feel for what's happening in climate science."</p><p>Research by Lisa Sloan, associate professor of Earth sciences, indicates that global warming will lead to significant changes in rainfall and snowfall patterns in California over the next 50 to 100 years. Sloan recently received a major grant from the National Science Foundation to establish a computational laboratory--the Climate Change and Impacts Laboratory--for multidisciplinary research on regional climate change. She and her colleagues presented their latest findings at the meeting.</p><p>Other UCSC researchers who gave presentations include Michael Loik, a researcher in environmental studies who heads PrecipNet, an international network of researchers focusing on the impacts of climate change on precipitation; Weixin Cheng, associate professor of environmental studies, who studies the effects of rising carbon dioxide concentrations on plants, soils, and ecosystems; and Bruno Sanso, a visiting associate professor in applied mathematics and statistics, who studies statistical modeling of precipitation and climate change. The workshop also included presentations from various state agencies. </p><p>The STEPS Institute was established earlier this year with a $500,000 gift from UCSC alumnus Gordon Ringold. The institute is working to link environmental research efforts campuswide, bringing together expertise from a wide range of departments in the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Core technical facilities on the campus, such as Sloan's climate change lab, provide a good base for making those links between faculty in different departments and divisions, said STEPS director John Thompson, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>In addition, the institute is working to open up communications between scientists and policy makers through forums such as last week's climate change workshop, Thompson said. </p><p>"This workshop and the others we are planning are attempts to bring people together in a way that has been talked about a lot but doesn't actually happen very often," he said. "I'm very pleased at how fast this has come together."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Haddad at (831) 459-4149 or bhaddad@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c75a98072704601a012ff563de320"><name>256</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC professor receives national honor</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Patricia Zavella, Zavella, NACCS, National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies</keywords><start-date>1037602800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC professor receives national...</display-name><path>/2002/11/256</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/256</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337961294</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337961294</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Patricia Zavella, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is being recognized nationally for her scholarship in the field of Chicana and Chicano studies.</p><p>	Zavella has been awarded the 2002-03 National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) Scholar Award.

Hamilton with a Length of Service Award for 120 years of daily weather observations and dedicated service to the United States. The award will be presented on Friday, November 22, at 11 a.m. in the observatory's main building atop Mt. Hamilton.</p><p>Presenting the award will be National Weather Service Western Region director Vickie L. Nadolski and David W. Reynolds, meteorologist in charge of the San Francisco Bay Area National Weather Service Forecast Office. Accepting the award on behalf of the observatory will be research astronomer and operations director Remington Stone.</p><p>The staff at Lick Observatory, as part of the National Weather Service Cooperative Observing Program, record the daily high and low temperatures, rainfall, and snowfall atop Mt. Hamilton. At the end of each month, this data is sent to the local National Weather Service Office in Monterey for quality control and then forwarded to the National Climate Center where it is incorporated into the official climate record of the United States. </p><p>This cooperative effort has been ongoing with Lick Observatory since completion of the first dome in 1881. The first dome housed a small 12-inch telescope that was used to record the transit of Mercury, which launched scientific research on Mt. Hamilton. From 1943 to 1965, Mt. Hamilton weather observers were in charge of taking airway weather observations in support of the United States Air Mail. Landmarks on the slopes of Mt. Diablo, Loma Prieta, and Mt. Tamalpais were used in determining the top of the fog across the San Francisco Bay Area. The cities of San Jose, Oakland, and San Francisco were also used to estimate the visibility. </p><p>Lick Observatory was the first major mountaintop observatory and continues to be an important research site. As part of the University of California, the telescopes and facilities on Mt. Hamilton serve as an observing station for faculty members and advanced students from the entire UC system. Observers live on Mt. Hamilton while using the telescopes. A resident group of staff, along with their families, form the year-round Mt. Hamilton population. The Lick Observatory astronomers, as well as the administrative and technical headquarters, are based on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p><p>The National Weather Service Cooperative Observing Program consists of 12,000 volunteer citizens and institutions observing and reporting weather information on a 24-hour basis. These Cooperative observations form the backbone of temperature and precipitation records describing the climate of the United States. </p><p>Today's cooperative observers have proud traditions dating back to the first days of the nation. As early as 1797, Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nationwide network of weather observers with at least one observer per county. </p><p>The Cooperative Observing Program was formally established by the Organic Act of 1890 with the purpose of taking meteorological observations to "establish and record the climate conditions of the United States." In addition to meeting the original agriculturally-oriented mission to describe the climate of the United States, today's cooperative observations support many other applications. These include climate change and variability; water management; drought assessment; presidential disaster declarations (heat, floods, etc.); crop yield forecasts; litigation; engineering, power plant and architectural design; recreation; flood zone determination; and insurance industry needs.</p><p>Satellites, high-speed computers, mathematical computer models of the atmosphere, and other technological breakthroughs have brought great benefits to the nation in terms of better forecasts and warnings. But without the century-long accumulation of accurate weather observations taken by volunteer observers, scientists could not begin to describe the climate of the United States.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c78518072704601a012ffb63b430b"><name>258</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jingle Shells Holiday Art and Book Festival takes place Saturday, December 7, at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Jingle Shells Art and Book Festival, Seymour Marine Discovery Center</keywords><start-date>1037948400000</start-date><display-name>Jingle Shells Holiday Art...</display-name><path>/2002/11/258</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/258</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337962016</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337962016</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory is celebrating the holidays with its annual Jingle Shells Art and Book Festival on Saturday, December 7, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Do your holiday shopping in a festive atmosphere, with live music, refreshments, children's crafts and storytelling, and free gift wrapping.

The correspondence documents a period in Carver's life when he made the transition from being a relatively obscure writer to becoming a commercially successful and well-known author. Carver is widely credited with revitalizing the American short story more than anyone since Ernest Hemingway and Flannery O'Connor.</p><p>	"The contents are both literary and personal," noted Swanger, a poet and longtime friend of Carver. "They include Carver's reflections on my writings, thoughts about his own work, personal insights into his life when he stopped drinking and when he met the well-known poet Tess Gallagher, details about family relationships, jobs, and economic success. Later letters talk more about his personal happiness and rebirth."</p><p>	Swanger first met Carver at UCSC when they both arrived on campus to teach in 1971. Carver spent three years at the university, teaching poetry and writing classes as a visiting lecturer.</p><p>	"Ray was a magnet--he attracted literary figures from around the state," Swanger said. "Whenever a writer was in the area, Ray would get him to do a reading at the university and we would have a dinner. It was quite an exhilarating time and supportive environment."</p><p>	According to an appraisal by Ken Lopez, a rare book dealer specializing in 20th century literature, individual Raymond Carver letters seldom appear on the market. But when they do, he said they can easily garner a price ranging from $500 to $1,500, depending on the content.</p><p>	"Some of the letters now seem ominous in retrospect," Swanger said. "When he had stopped drinking and said that life couldn't be better, he was also not far from his death. Ray said the worst was behind him, but we now know the worst was ahead--he died of brain cancer at the age of 52."</p><p>A highlight of the collection is a letter dated November 30, 1980, where Carver talks about his personal health and success, as well as a New York Times article, a forthcoming visit with George Plimpton and Jackie Onassis for the Paris Review, and aborted plans to stay in Robert Frost's house:</p><p>	"God, my thirties liked to have killed me! I was glad to get out of those thirties. In so many ways the whole time was like a strange and sometimes bad dream.some terrible losses along the way, of course.My drinking was like a cancer, and I was dying from it. Now I have a life again, a new life. I could die tomorrow, heaven forbid, but it would be all right. I've much to be thankful and, believe me, I am thankful for it."</p><p>	Swanger noted that the Carver correspondence should be of distinct interest to students of Carver, scholars, and biographers. He added that he felt it was important to give the collection to UCSC.</p><p>	"I have very warm feelings toward the UCSC library, and I thought that some Carver material should stay on campus and not go elsewhere," he said. </p><p>"Carver became famous here," Swanger added. "Further, there's yet to be a biography of him, although there are collections of pieces. I would very much like to see the UCSC library create a Carver center, and this collection could be a cornerstone."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c7b6f8072704601a012ff44f0c7fb"><name>260</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founding member of Free Speech Movement warns of impending loss of Constitutional rights in war against terrorism</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Bettina Aptheker, Patriot Act, USA Patriot Act, Free Speech Movement</keywords><start-date>1038294000000</start-date><display-name>Founding member of Free...</display-name><path>/2002/11/260</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/260</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337962621</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337962621</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>U.S. citizens should be less complacent and trusting of a government that has a long record of abuse of power, warns a founding member of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in 1964 who is now professor and chair of the Women's Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>	"Because of the horror of the attacks on the World Trade Center, people think it's OK to have their Constitutional rights compromised," Bettina Aptheker said. "But I think people really aren't aware of the extent they're being compromised."</p><p>	Aptheker has an essay featured in <i>The Free Speech Movement: Reflections on Berkeley in the 1960s,</i> a definitive history of the movement just published by the University of California press and edited by UC Berkeley professor Reginald E. Zelnik and New York University professor Robert Cohen. </p><p>	"The timing of this book is rather appropriate," Aptheker noted. "It's celebrating and analyzing a movement that supported fundamental Constitutional rights to freedom of speech at a moment when the Bush administration and [Attorney General] John Ashcroft are abrogating those rights."</p><p>	"It may be helpful in making us more aware of how fragile the Constitution and the Bill of Rights can be, and how easy it is to abuse power," she added.</p><p>	The volume is a collection of essays and memoirs by veterans of the Free Speech Movement, ranging from leader Mario Savio to UC President Clark Kerr, who was fired in 1967. Recent reports in the media have indicated that the FBI campaigned to oust Kerr from the presidency, even though agents found no evidence that he was disloyal to the government. This prompted a vow by Senator Dianne Feinstein in mid-November to pursue at a future congressional hearing what she termed "significant misues of FBI power" at UC Berkeley.</p><p>	Aptheker's essay describes gender politics and the ways in which women's freedom of speech as a Constitutional right have been impeded over the years. A major leader of the Free Speech Movement who spoke at nearly every rally in the mid-'60s, she draws a parallel between questionable FBI activity more than three decades ago, and recent legislation just passed by Congress to increase the organization's powers.</p><p>	"I think most people don't understand the USA Patriot Act and don't even know what's in it.and they would be appalled if they did," she said. "For example, it allows preventative detention of non-citizens, even if they're here legally and not connected to terrorism at all. It also allows for wiretapping and searches without traditional warrants--you don't need a judge."</p><p>	Aptheker explained that the government is using the same strategy it used in the past, but now is more upfront about it.</p><p>	"In the '50s, the way they got away with abrogating Constitutional rights was to scare people about Communists. Terrible things were done, crimes were committed, and many lives were ruined. Now, what you have is a looming fear of terrorism." </p><p>"Groups of people--especially Arab Americans, or people who look like them--are targeted," Aptheker added. "And anybody can be called a terrorist. It's hard to prove you're not linked once an accusation has been made. It's exactly the same strategy that was used with Communism."</p><p>Aptheker cautioned that freedom of speech can also exist in theory, but not be practiced in reality.</p><p>"I believe there was something approaching 200,000 people protesting against the Bush administration's proposed war against Iraq on October 26 in Washington, D.C., but it got virtually no media coverage," she said. "Again, this shows that there can be freedom of speech formally, but it doesn't mean anything because the news is so managed."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c7cd08072704601a012ffd28b2810"><name>261</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fresno High grad reaches out to students at her alma mater</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>MaryJane Skjellerup, GIIP program, Fresno High</keywords><start-date>1038207600000</start-date><display-name>Fresno High grad reaches...</display-name><path>/2002/11/261</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/261</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337963168</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337963168</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sociology major MaryJane Skjellerup is reaching out by reaching back--to Fresno High School, that is.</p><p>	Skjellerup is using the power and allure of technology to introduce Hmong and Latino youth in her native Fresno to what's available for them at the university. </p><p>	Skjellerup, a graduate of Fresno High School and a senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has single-handedly launched the Community and Technology Leadership Program to encourage Fresno High students from disadvantaged backgrounds to get on track for college. She uses a combination of hands-on training in sophisticated digital media technology, mentoring, and academic advising to give teenagers a taste of what's available to college students.</p><p>	"I want to encourage kids to come to the university by giving them skills that will boost their confidence and make them feel unique," said Skjellerup. "I want to show them we're willing to invest in them."</p><p>	Skjellerup says UCSC attracts idealists, and she has coupled her own idealism with activism. With little more than her own commitment and minimal start-up funds from UCSC's Global Information Internship Program (GIIP), Skjellerup went back to her hometown with a proposal Fresno High administrators jumped at.</p><p>	"This is the first time we've ever done anything like this, but it has been very worthwhile," said Fresno High business computer technology teacher Helen Herzog, who coordinates the project with Skjellerup with the support of her department chair, Delaine Zody. "A lot of our students have a very narrow vision of the opportunities open to them after they graduate from high school.  This has opened their eyes to the options that are available for them. MaryJane has been a great help and an inspiration to them." 	</p><p>	Herzog and Zody selected six high school students who came to UCSC for a two-day summer workshop. Tapping the two-inch-thick training manual she put together for the workshop, Skjellerup describes a daunting itinerary that covered college admissions, a campus tour, web and graphic design instruction, and a daylong hands-on digital film and editing course. </p><p>	With that introduction, the students returned to high school this fall where they are working with Skjellerup and their teachers on community-service projects to prepare oral histories of members of the Hmong and Latino communities in Fresno. The group will produce two short video documentaries about their subjects and post them on a web site about cultural awareness they will design and launch.</p><p>	"There are 40,000 Southeast Asian refugees in Fresno. There's tremendous cultural diversity all around them," said Skjellerup. "But when I ask the kids if they know their own parents' stories, they say 'No.' They don't think it's important. I want to change that."</p><p>	Skjellerup says working with high school students is "refreshing."</p><p>	"They learn so fast compared to adults," she said. Now that they've gotten a taste of technology, Skjellerup hopes they'll stick with it and see college as a way to build their expertise. So far, the program is a hit, with all participants saying they want to return next year to help the "new kids."</p><p>	If she can secure funding, Skjellerup would like to expand her program next summer to a two-week residential workshop with five students from six schools. Herzog, too, would like the program to continue, with Skjellerup's protégés working one-on-one next semester to share their new knowledge and skills with Herzog's other students. "The students are learning the newest technology--technology I hope they'll share if we are able to purchase the necessary software licenses and upgrade our equipment," said Herzog.</p><p>	Skjellerup's passion for learning is matched by her desire to make the world a better place, so designing and launching the Community and Technology Leadership Program came naturally. From the beginning of her own years at UCSC, she has approached college as a model hands-on learner.  She discovered GIIP (pronounced "jeep") during her sophomore year and has used it as a platform for action ever since.</p><p>	"Sociology is one of the majors that lets you know about the problems in the world, all the inequality," said Skjellerup. "When it comes to really accomplishing things, people can get lost between their ideals and the implementation of real change." GIIP, she said, is "a mechanism for change."</p><p>	UCSC sociology professor Paul Lubeck launched GIIP in 1998 to address growing inequality in access to information networks and global communications. Lubeck couldn't be more pleased by Skjellerup's enthusiasm, and the difference she is making for young people in Fresno.</p><p>	"MaryJane is amazing," said Lubeck. "She has really taken the ball and run with it. Now she's taking the GIIP vision into the high school, and that's incredible."</p><p>	By giving Hmong and Latino students at Fresno High the tools of high-tech communication, Skjellerup is contributing to GIIP's mission to "democratize globalization."	</p><p>	"Globalization is not just about making financial transactions easier," she said. "It's a whole new playing field, and if you don't know the rules, you have no chance of succeeding. We're helping people learn the rules." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2830fed8072704601a012ffcb5f36de"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626752455</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626752455</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2830fed8072704601a012ffcb5f36de"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2002/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626752455</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626752455</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
