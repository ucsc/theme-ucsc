But after almost a century of economic and social ties, Japan and Brazil have built a "dynamic bridge of migrations," says author Karen Tei Yamashita. Her book <I>Circle K Cycles</I> (Coffee House Press, 2001) explores these connections through the lives of Brazilians of Japanese descent living in Japan. Yamashita will read from her work at 7 p.m. on March 11, at the Santa Cruz Central Branch Library, 224 Church Street. Cosponsored by the Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Library and the Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the event is free and open to the public.</p><p>"Brazil is literally on the opposite side of the world from Japan," said Yamashita, an associate professor of literature and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A third-generation Japanese American, she lived in Brazil for nine years while researching and writing her first two novels, married a Brazilian, and began raising her two children while in Sao Paulo. "The connection of Japan and Brazil seems to be a very extreme example," said Yamashita, "but it's not that strange in the global circumstance." </p><p>Economics, agriculture, and immigration laws created the conditions for a wave of Japanese immigration to Brazil in the early 20th century. Brazil needed contract labor for its booming coffee plantations. Japanese companies needed new countries in which to place workers after exclusion acts ended legal immigration from Asia to the United States. Today, Brazil has the largest community of Japanese and their descendants outside Japan. </p><p>But in the 1980s, driven by a faltering Brazilian economy, the tide of migration began to shift back from Brazil to Japan. In response to the trend, the Japanese government passed an immigration law providing special visas to people who could prove they were of Japanese descent. Even the key stipulation that visa holders could only engage in manual labor didn't slow the reverse migration. "Now there are 200,000 Brazilians living in Japan, mostly working as factory laborers," said Yamashita. "There are even 'Brazil towns'!"</p><p>Circle K Cycles chronicles life in Brazilian communities across Japan. "Brazil towns are very dynamic communities," said Yamashita, who lived with her husband and children in Japan for six months while gathering material for her book. She conveys the community's energy by combining genres in an unusual format. Chapters include monthly journal entries Yamashita posted online during her stay in Japan and fictional stories based on the lives of the Brazilian immigrants she interviewed. Popular cultural graphics fill the book, mirroring the inundation of images in Japanese cities. The confusion of a new language is conveyed through chapters in Japanese and Portuguese, which are both translated into English. The book's title refers to the ubiquitous Circle K convenience stores, open 24 hours a day and providing a de facto extension of home life and a common ground for all city dwellers. Circle K Cycles captures the community's vitality and the residents' mutual culture shock as Brazilians encounter what Yamashita calls "this other place which is supposed to be a kind of home."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bc0968072704601a012ffc3ab0793"><name>78</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Local children featured in 'listening to the earth' performance</title><author>Ann Gibb (831) 459-2495; anngibb@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1014966000000</start-date><display-name>Local children featured in...</display-name><path>/2002/03/78</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/78</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337914976</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337914976</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ann Gibb</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>anngibb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Try this recipe for a special performance event: Take the leadership of Tandy Beal, a theater arts instructor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Add 40 UC Santa Cruz students. Mix well with 200 young local students, their teachers, and community members. Blend in weeks of schools visits, teaching, and practice. The result? Listening to the Earth, a theater project featuring children and adult performers, which will be served up twice on Friday, March 8, at 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Mainstage Theater.</p><p>"This production is about engaging the imaginations of all the students in the show," said Beal, a dancer who cowrote the production with composer Jon Scoville in 1987. Listening to the Earth has been performed in communities throughout the West and in Hawaii. Combining story-telling, music, and dance, it relates the journey of six young children and their encounters with three magical characters. The participation of local students as performers and contributors is a crucial component of Listening to the Earth, and the UC Santa Cruz performance is the culmination of an arts education outreach program involving eight schools. "It's thrilling to have this cross-generational and community project at UCSC. The kids love it," said Beal.</p><p>Producing Listening to the Earth was also enriching for Beal's UC Santa Cruz students. Working in teams, they visited participating classes to coach the children, all 12 years of age or younger, for the performance. Although Beal choreographed each dance in the production, her students were encouraged to help the children develop their own interpretations. "Both my students and the young children learned to balance the joy of movement with the discipline of practice," said Beal.</p><p>Listening to the Earth also features performers Stephanie Settle, J. J. Porter, Paula Bliss, Rock Lerum, and Saki Sakamoto. The production is partially funded by grants from the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County and the National Endowment for the Arts. Tickets are $9 for adults, $5 for children under 16, and are available in advance from the UCSC Ticket Office.

For many African American musicians the word "jazz" is a double-edged term, sometimes representing black accomplishment and virtuosity; sometimes a symbol of segregation and creative limitations.</p><p>It's a dichotomy that extends from the word to the music as well. Jazz has been seen as a way to showcase contributions of African Americans to American society, to highlight black history and affirm black culture. But for some African American musicians, the music called jazz is a reminder of an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions.</p><p>"Now, jazz is celebrated as America's classical music," said Eric Porter, author of <I>What Is This Thing Called Jazz?</I> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002). "But in the past, it had a second-class status."</p><p>In his new book Porter, an assistant professor of American studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, covers the transformations, debates, and achievements of the African American jazz community across the last century. Analyzing the writings and commentaries of African American jazz musicians, Porter looks at the public face of a critical dialogue within the African American jazz community, and documents the intersections of music, American society, and African American intellectual history. The overlapping issues of race, economics, politics, and gender reverberate across decades of jazz history.</p><p>"It was surprising to find how much consistency there was over time in the core issues and themes," said Porter. "While the conversations changed in significant ways over the course of jazz history, depending on the position of music in the culture and society, it's interesting to see how many of the same issues had been addressed from different perspectives and at different times."</p><p>One common point of contention has been the ways the discriminatory economic structure of the music industry has plagued African American musicians for much of the 20th century. "Jazz has, in important ways, marked the position of African American musicians as laborers in the music industry," said Porter. Especially in the first half of the last century, it was not uncommon for African Americans trained in classical music to take jobs as jazz musicians when racial discrimination prevented them from obtaining positions in symphony orchestras. Porter documents the work of percussionist Max Roach, singer Abbey Lincoln, and others artist activists who, according to Porter's research, "accelerated a long-standing critique of economic inequalities in the music industry."</p><p>Female vocalists like Lincoln are notable exceptions in the largely male influenced history of jazz. Although women "have generally been the most popular and respected jazz singers," said Porter, "the community of jazz instrumentalists has largely been dominated by men, which in turn, has helped create a sense that jazz is a field of masculine accomplishment." African American men dominated the development of the black jazz community, and the language and concepts of jazz, just as men dominated in the other arts, the workforce in general, and most aspects of American society.</p><p>As Eric Porter's book makes clear, there's no simple answer to the question "What is this thing called jazz?" But paying attention to the ideas of African American musicians working in jazz, Porter argued, can "provide a means for rethinking jazz history. Musicians' ideas can add another chapter to the story of African American intellectual life."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bc3268072704601a012ff4dd3e6a0"><name>80</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Learn how to control gophers, on March 16 at the UCSC Farm</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1015225200000</start-date><display-name>Learn how to control...</display-name><path>/2002/03/80</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/80</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337915635</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337915635</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kids can learn about farm predators during concurrent workshop</p>
<p>If those telltale mounds of freshly upturned earth in your garden make you hiss like an agitated house cat, you'll want to learn the best ways to keep your garden gopher-free during a workshop on Saturday, March 16, at the UC Santa Cruz Farm.</p>
<p>Last year was a banner year for gophers, and this year is shaping up to be "pretty severe," according to workshop leader Thomas Wittman, who will share his tips on controlling and excluding gophers from 10 a.m. to noon at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm.</p>
<p>Wittman's talk will focus on nonpoison strategies of gopher control, including traps and exclusion. He'll introduce his favorite trap, cover the pros and cons of various exclusion methods, and discuss predators from domestic cats to barn owls. He'll also give you the lowdown on a range of high-priced gadgets that don't work.</p>
<p>Gophers are among the most destructive pests in the farm and garden. A single gopher can take out a mature apple tree, said Wittman, adding that the 25-acre UCSC Farm was trapping about 15 gophers a day at the peak of last year's summer harvest.</p>
<p>"I think of Santa Cruz and San Jose as the gopher heartland. We have the perfect climate for them," said educator and consultant Wittman, a partner in the Molino Creek Farming Collective and owner of Gophers, Ltd.</p>
<p>March and April are breeding months for gophers, with females giving birth to an average of four to 10 young per litter. At about three weeks of age, when her young are capable of foraging for themselves, the mother kicks her young out of the burrow, and within four or five months, those offspring are capable of reproducing, said Wittman, whose workshop will be half lecture and half field demonstration.</p>
<p>Cost is $10; $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Fees are payable at the workshop. For more information, call (831) 459-3240. The workshop is cosponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the gopher talk will be a workshop for children, "Predators on Our Farm." Sponsored by the Life Lab Science Program based at UCSC, this workshop for children ages 7-11 will explore bats, owls, and other predators that help control pests in the garden. Highlights include educational activities, a farm tour, and videos. The children's workshop will take place on Saturday, March 16, from 10 a.m. to noon in the Life Lab Garden Classroom at the UCSC Farm. Cost is $5 per child. Preregistration is required; for more information or to register, call (831) 459-2001.</p>
<p>The UCSC Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.</p>
<p>The Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden is a community-based group that promotes public awareness of organic gardening and farming.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bc4638072704601a012ff49ed6ec4"><name>81</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statewide MESA program and UCSC MESA director honored for innovative education programs</title><author>Kristin Cobb (831) 459-2495, kcobb@cats.ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1015225200000</start-date><display-name>Statewide MESA program and...</display-name><path>/2002/03/81</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/81</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337915951</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337915951</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The California Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program, a statewide program with an academic support center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named one of the five most innovative public programs in the country. In addition, the director of the MESA Schools Program at UC Santa Cruz, Antonio Garcia, was honored individually for his innovative work on a new MESA initiative. These recent honors highlight the remarkable success of the MESA program, established in 1970 to help educationally disadvantaged students in California to succeed in math, science, and engineering and to prepare for college admission.</p><p>MESA serves 35,000 students in California and is a model for similar programs in seven other states. The program helps students prepare for math-based majors at four-year universities. Around 85 percent of high school seniors who participate in MESA go on to college--a much higher rate than the state average of 50 percent. MESA students account for 90 percent of the state's engineering degree recipients from underrepresented groups and 12 percent of the nation's. </p><p>The MESA program was selected from among 1,200 nominees to receive the Innovations in American Government award, presented on December 13, 2001, in Washington, D.C. The Innovations in American Government awards recognize five programs annually for excellence and creative problem solving in government. The $100,000 awards are granted by the Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, the Ford Foundation, and the Council for Excellence in Government. Governor Gray Davis nominated MESA for the award. </p><p>"This award has given us a high visibility in the country this year. It has also helped to reinforce the commitment and investment of local industries and to grab the attention of local school districts," Garcia said. </p><p>Garcia himself was honored at the annual Professional Agricultural Workers Conference on December 3 at Tuskegee University in Alabama. He was invited to speak at the conference about the MESA Agricultural Initiative, and was nominated for Tuskegee's George Washington Carver Hall of Fame. Garcia helped found the MESA Agricultural Initiative, which encourages middle and high school students to excel in agricultural-based sciences, which are particularly important to California. </p><p>"The MESA Agricultural Initiative is a new direction within MESA," Garcia said. "It's consistent with our effort to reach out to the rural communities in California."</p><p>The University of California oversees the MESA program, which is a partnership between UC and California State University campuses, private universities, community colleges, public schools, education centers, and private industry.

<p>"Not since Marcel Marceau in his heyday have I been so entranced</p>
<p>by an evening of wordless wonderment." --Chicago Reader</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures presents the hilarious, touching and always captivating body-theater of Peru's Teatro Hugo &amp; Ines. Mounting their production Short Stories on Wednesday, April 10 and Thursday, April 11, 2002 at 8:00 pm at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage, these extraordinary wizards of hand trickery are a must-see treat for adults and children alike.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary, Teatro Hugo &amp; Ines combine mime, dance, and puppetry to create a host of characters composed of knees, feet, hands, elbows and a handful of props. Playing out the poetic moments of everyday life, the pair simply thrills audiences with amazing dexterity and delightful creativity. The Chicago Sun-Times sums up the genius of this wildly popular international duo from Peru--"It's simple enough to make audiences giggle. It takes art to make them believe."</p>
<p>The audience is invited to stay after the performance for a Meet-the-Artist discussion!</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>Hugo Suarez, born in Lima, Peru and Ines Pasic, born in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, first crossed paths in Italy where Hugo was performing mime on the street. Ines, trained as a pianist at the Sarajevo Conservatory, began to study pantomime with Hugo and quickly discovered that her dexterity on the keyboard had provided her with tools that would be useful in mime as well as music. Together they founded Teatro Hugo &amp; Ines in 1986 and premiered their first production, Return to Darkness the following year. They have since traveled the world, performing at festivals throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Their Adventures of Ginocchio, presented as part of the 1994 Jim Henson Festival of Puppet Theater, was one of the first productions to travel as part of the Henson Festival's national On Tour program. Hugo &amp; Ines have subsequently returned every year to the United States, performing at the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater in New York and throughout the U.S. including sold-out extended engagements at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Festival of Arts &amp; Ideas and the Kennedy Center. They have also filmed segments for the nationally broadcast PBS series Between the Lions. Highlights of this year include three multiple-week tours to Japan and sold out, week-long engagements at the Ordway in St. Paul and Chicago's international Puppetropolis festival, and their current tour to California. Hugo &amp; Ines live in Lima with their son, Raul and daughter Marina.</p>

Several groups of mammals, including early primates and modern hooved mammals, made their first appearances in Asia, Europe, and North America around this time. A new study published in the March 15 issue of the journal Science supports the idea that Asia was the center of origin for at least one important group of mammals, and probably for several others as well.</p><p>The study allows paleontologists for the first time to compare the fossil sequences of Asia, Europe, and North America for this dramatic period in Earth's history, said Paul Koch, an associate professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the paper.</p><p>"Now we can finally see what was happening in Asia at the same time that there were dramatic changes in the faunas of North America and Europe," Koch said.</p><p>The results are consistent with phylogenetic studies that have pointed to Asia as the center of origin for several important groups of mammals, including primates and the two orders of hooved mammals, artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates, such as deer, cows, and sheep) and perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, rhinos, and tapirs). The study also shows that an extinct family of carnivorous mammals, the hyaenodontids, definitely appeared first in Asia and later migrated to North America.</p><p>"These groups probably spread to North America across the Bering land bridge in response to the warming of the climate that occurred at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary," said Gabriel Bowen, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth sciences at UCSC and first author of the paper. </p><p>The boundary is marked in the geologic record by an anomalous blip in carbon isotope ratios. Geochemists have linked this anomaly to a massive release of methane gas from the ocean, which altered the isotopic composition of the carbon pool over the entire surface of the Earth. Since methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, this oceanic belch of methane may well have driven the transient global warming that occurred at this time, dramatically altering the global climate for about 100,000 years.</p><p>"The very same global change that may have let the animals wander more widely is also the event that lets us nail down the timing," Koch noted.</p><p>Koch and Bowen worked with William Clyde of the University of New Hampshire in a cooperative project with the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) led by Suyin Ting of Louisiana State University. They joined IVPP paleontologists Yuanqing Wang and Yuan Wang to collect and analyze samples from the Hengyang Basin in southern China. Ting has been working in this area for many years, studying the rich fossil fauna found in layers of brick-red to tan sandstones and mudstones known as the Lingcha Formation. </p><p>The researchers used a combination of techniques, including isotope analysis and magnetic markers, to develop a chronological sequence of fossil assemblages from China that they could compare with similar sequences for North America and Europe. Carbonate nodules in the rocks of the Lingcha Formation yielded carbon isotope ratios that pinpointed the time of methane release and global warming in the fossil-bearing layers. Changes in Earth's magnetic field were also recorded in the layers of rock, providing additional markers for correlating the positions of fossils from different sites. John Alroy of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara and Takehisa Tsubamoto of Kyoto University performed a "quantitative biochronology" analysis of fossil data that helped extend the correlations from the Hengyang Basin to other fossil sites in China.</p><p>"This is a rare situation in the fossil record where we can pin down a point in time and look at the distribution of groups of animals on several continents," Bowen said. </p><p>The most conclusive results were for the hyaenodontid creodonts, a group of dog-like predators that were clearly present in Asia before they appeared in Europe or North America. The hyaenodontids were the dominant predators of the Eocene, ranging from small mongoose-like creatures to huge wolf-like animals with powerful jaws. Now extinct, they were eventually supplanted by modern carnivores. </p><p>With respect to the primates and the hooved mammals (perissodactyls and artiodactyls), the researchers found that representatives of these modern orders first appeared in Asia no later than they did in North America, and possibly earlier. </p><p>"Based on the best data we have now for correlating different Asian faunas, it looks quite possible that these groups were present in Asia first, but we can't say definitively yet," Bowen said.</p><p>Additional geochemical and paleomagnetic studies of fossil sites in Asia may clear up the remaining ambiguities. But Koch noted that many groups of mammals may have originated during the Paleocene in tropical parts of Asia or even Africa, where preservation of fossils is poor. </p><p>"If in the Paleocene they were present in Asia in the tropics, we would only get to see their fossils when they got to the desert regions at higher latitudes. So it might be that the warming at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary allowed them to get into the higher latitudes for the first time, and then they continued to extend their range into Europe and North America," Koch said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Koch at (831) 459-5861 or pkoch@earthsci.ucsc.edu and Bowen at (831) 459-5088 or gbowen@earthsci.ucsc.edu. </p><p>For images, contact Tim Stephens at (831) 459-4352 or stephens@cats.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bc9b58072704601a012ff33d0ad6b"><name>85</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC students to be honored at UC Day in Sacramento</title><author>Kristin Cobb (831) 459-2495; kcobb@cats.ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1016175600000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC students to...</display-name><path>/2002/03/85</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/85</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337917311</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337917311</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Each spring, alumni from the University of California's nine campuses meet with state lawmakers in Sacramento as part of the annual UC Day legislative conference. At this year's conference, March 18-19, two UC Santa Cruz students will be honored for work they submitted for the UC Research Poster Competition.</p><p>Patrice Friedmann and Haivan Ngo will travel to Sacramento to be recognized at the UCSC alumni reception and dinner and to present posters on their research. </p><p>Friedmann's research focuses on fluid flow within the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean offshore of Costa Rica. She is a senior from Santa Maria, CA, majoring in Earth sciences. Andrew Fisher, associate professor of Earth sciences, is the faculty mentor overseeing her research.</p><p>Ngo is studying European beach grass that is invading beaches in California. She is a senior biology major from Alhambra, CA, and was born in Vung Tau,Vietnam. Her mentor is Julie Beckstead, a postdoctoral researcher in biology.</p><p>The UC Day conference, sponsored by the Alumni Associations of the University of California (AAUC), focuses on the importance of state support for the mission and programs of the University of California. The theme of the 2002 UC Day is "UC: Connecting with California's Communities." </p><p>Three years ago, the AAUC began inviting UC undergraduates with the best examples of student research to the conference. </p><p>"We wanted to get the message to legislators that undergraduates should be part of the research enterprise," said Lynda Goff, UCSC vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "Undergraduate students come to UC to do research, and it's an incredibly important part of their careers." </p><p>Friedmann will present a poster on "Evidence for hydrothermal circulation and alteration on 20-25 Ma crust about to be subducted in the Middle American Trench." The study looks at how fluid circulation affects a large plate of the Earth's crust on the ocean floor that is diving down beneath another plate in Central America. Her work may be useful in predicting where earthquakes will occur. </p><p>"This award is a real honor," Friedmann said. "I'll be able to talk to people outside of science and give them an idea of what we are working on and why it's important. Presenting my work to a nonscientific community challenges me to look at it on a bigger scale."</p><p>Ngo's research focuses on an aggressive European grass that is invading coastal dunes in California and eliminating the native beach grass. Her poster is titled "Is the invasive success of Ammophila arenaria explained by pathogenic fungi? A test of Koch's postulates." Her research showed that the European beach grass is susceptible to certain types of fungi and that its invasive explosion cannot be explained by resistance to fungal diseases.</p><p>"This award means a lot to me," Ngo said. "I'm a single parent, and I was rejected from a lot of labs because I am a parent. I'm hoping that my being honored at UC Day tells the next parent not to be discouraged."</p><p>At the conference, the UC Office of Research acknowledges the work of outstanding undergraduate researchers on all of UC's eight undergraduate campuses. Each campus nominates four undergraduate students for their research in any field; of these four, the UC Office of Research chooses two or three per campus to attend the conference and display a poster illustrating the research conducted.</p><p>"It's a fabulous honor," Goff said. </p><p>Each award winner will display a poster illustrating the research conducted and have an opportunity to discuss that research with alumni, legislators, and policy makers at UC Day.

A new tuna factory on the lagoon's shores threatened to drastically change the lagoon before Potts could capture a scant fraction of its initial state. Returning to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, Potts was determined to find a faster and more comprehensive way to study ecosystems.</p><p>William Pickles, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL), had the answer Potts was looking for: hyperspectral remote sensing. Usually done from aircraft, hyperspectral imaging allows scientists to take pictures of large areas of the Earth from high above. Other imaging techniques are deployed on satellites, but hyperspectral images capture far more information than most satellite images. Potts found he could receive sweeping, detailed data without ever leaving his office, and could potentially detect changes in the environment before they became apparent to the human eye. </p><p>That was five years ago. Potts and Pickles, along with UCSC Earth sciences professor Eli Silver, have been working together ever since.</p><p>"For the first time, we're able to see the full complexity of these very complicated systems. Up until now, you could only see a small part of the system at one time," Potts said.</p><p>The researchers first used hyperspectral imaging to study geothermal activity in Long Valley Caldera, east of the Sierra Nevada, in a project led by Earth sciences graduate student Brigette Martini. "We picked Long Valley as kind of a testing ground because it has been very well mapped," Silver said.</p><p>Hyperspectral imaging is revealing new details about this area, including previously unrecognized fault lines. Martini was also able to characterize activity along these fault lines, particularly the movement of hot water and the release of carbon dioxide. </p><p>Most recently, Martini discovered a new way to identify areas where high amounts of carbon dioxide are coming directly out of the ground, often causing "tree-kill zones" because of their lethal effect on trees. These areas are potentially dangerous to humans and other animals.</p><p>"This result really blew us away," Silver said. "Now we can go to many other areas that aren't well studied and just image the ground to look for high carbon dioxide signatures." </p><p>Potts's team is also completing a detailed mapping of a 650-square-kilometer region of Monterey Bay, including the Elkhorn Slough estuary and its watershed. Ocean sciences graduate student Susan Cochran initiated the project, which is being continued by Stacy Jupiter, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology. Imaging the area took just 45 minutes, but interpreting the more than 250 million pixels worth of data has taken two years. Once they have a baseline map, the scientists will re-image the area periodically, and compare the new data with the old data, pixel by pixel. </p><p>"This is a very powerful tool for change analysis," Potts said.</p><p>Hyperspectral instruments, which are currently carried primarily on airplanes, scan the ground beneath and pick up the characteristic light signatures of the plants, microbes, and minerals below. Sunlight is made up of an array of colors, or wavelengths of light--some visible to the eye and some invisible. Different materials reflect different wavelengths from this array, creating a unique pattern, called a spectrum. Hyperspectral sensors detect at least 100 unique bands of this spectrum, compared to the 7 to 15 bands detected by most current satellite-borne instruments. </p><p>Using hyperspectral imaging, scientists can map the boundaries of different kinds of surfaces; they can identify many minerals and some species of vegetation, algae, and microbial films and chart their distributions; they can even learn about the health of distant organisms. For example, healthy plants absorb a lot of red light and reflect strongly in the green and infrared, whereas dying plants reflect light across most wavelengths. </p><p>Potts's team is using hyperspectral imaging to assess coastal marine ecosystems and land margins and to track changes caused by natural and anthropogenic effects. "There's a general sense in the scientific community that these shallow coastal margins are where regional and global changes are going to be felt first," Potts said. </p><p>Potts and ocean sciences graduate student Daria Siciliano are also part of a multi-agency effort to assess and monitor habitats in the northwest Hawaiian Islands. Called the Northwest Hawaiian Islands Rapid Assessment and Monitoring Program (NOW-RAMP), the project joins UCSC with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources, the Bishop Museum of Honolulu, and the University of Hawaii. </p><p>The northwest Hawaiian Islands are 10 uninhabited atolls, or low-lying coral reefs, that represent about 69 percent of the total area of coral reefs in the United States. The outermost atoll, Kure, is almost 2,000 kilometers (more than 1,200 miles) from Honolulu and has no infrastructure, making it difficult and expensive to explore from the ground.</p><p>"At the moment, they are virtually unexplored. There are no good maps," Potts said. </p><p>Potts and Siciliano are using a mixture of remote sensing techniques, including satellite imaging and hyperspectral imaging, to study aspects of the physics, chemistry, biology, and geology of the islands. Siciliano goes out twice a year to "ground-truth," to confirm what they are seeing from the sky and to match unknown spectral signatures to specific species. </p><p>Siciliano is using remote sensing to study how fast the Kure atoll is growing, measuring the rate at which polyps and algae deposit calcium carbonate, the skeleton of coral reefs. This calcification process is sensitive to sea temperature and to dissolved carbon dioxide, so changes in calcification rates can signal global climate change. </p><p>Siciliano's preliminary results indicate that coral cover and growth rates may be dramatically higher in some of the corals than has been reported in the past 50 years. If this result represents a true change, rather than errors in previous measurements, it may indicate rising sea temperatures, a sign of global warming.</p><p>"Worldwide rates of change seem to be accelerating due to human impacts," said Potts, who worries as much about local impacts, like the dumping of sewage and overfishing, as he does about global climate change. </p><p>Of 109 countries or major international territories with reef systems, more than 100 are developing countries, where people depend on reef-based economies and are concentrated on the coastlines. Accelerating population growth in these regions means accelerating local impacts, Potts said. </p><p>"There is a need to be able to assess and monitor these changes in real time," he said.</p><p>Hyperspectral imaging allows almost instantaneous data collection, compared to traditional methods of ecology, where scientists may labor for months or years to get limited data.</p><p>"None of the data we are collecting are as detailed as if you had ground crews dedicated to collecting this type of information, but what you lose in the detail, you gain by having equivalent levels of data for every pixel in the image over a large area," Potts said.</p><p>"With traditional methods of ecology you never got a sense of the huge scale of an entire estuary or an entire reef," he added. "The ecological phenomena that we're interested in are occurring on the scale of entire systems." </p><p>Eventually, Potts hopes to use hyperspectral imaging to monitor rapidly changing areas throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. He may get his first opportunity back in Papau New Guinea, where he is still doing surveys the old-fashioned way, in the water. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's note: Reporters may contact Donald Potts at (831) 459-4417 or potts@biology.ucsc.edu and Eli Silver at (831) 459-2266 or esilver@emerald.ucsc.edu. </p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bccb58072704601a012ffa3ebfa65"><name>87</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Encore event: Second gopher control workshop scheduled for April 6</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1016521200000</start-date><display-name>Encore event: Second gopher...</display-name><path>/2002/03/87</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/87</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337918078</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337918078</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If you offer it, they will come, and come they did to a March workshop on gopher control. So many people came, in fact, that dozens had to be turned away. As a result, the UC Santa Cruz Farm is hosting a second workshop on Saturday, April 6, for gardeners who want to learn the best ways to keep their gardens gopher-free without using poison.</p>
<p>Workshop leader Thomas Wittman will share his tips on controlling and excluding gophers from 10 a.m. to noon at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm. This time, if the weather cooperates, Wittman is prepared to offer the workshop outdoors to accommodate as many people as show up.</p>
<p>Wittman's talk will focus on nonpoison strategies of gopher control, including traps and exclusion. He'll introduce his favorite trap, cover the pros and cons of various exclusion methods, and discuss predators from domestic cats to barn owls. He'll also give you the lowdown on a range of high-priced gadgets that don't work.</p>
<p>Gophers are among the most destructive pests in the farm and garden. A single gopher can take out a mature apple tree, said Wittman, a partner in the Molino Creek Farming Collective and owner of Gophers, Ltd. The 25-acre UCSC Farm was trapping about 15 gophers a day at the peak of last year's summer harvest, he said.</p>
<p>March and April are breeding months for gophers, with females giving birth to an average of four to 10 young per litter. At about three weeks of age, when her young are capable of foraging for themselves, the mother kicks her young out of the burrow, and within four or five months, those offspring are capable of reproducing, said Wittman, whose workshop will be half lecture and half field demonstration.</p>
<p>Cost is $10; $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Fees are payable at the workshop. For more information, call (831) 459-3240. The workshop is cosponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>The UCSC Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bcdef8072704601a012ffe38effd2"><name>88</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz marine biologist Mary Silver honored by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1016694000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz marine...</display-name><path>/2002/03/88</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/88</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337918392</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337918392</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will present one of its highest honors, the Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award, to Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Silver is being honored for providing "significant scientific leadership in understanding our marine environment" and for providing "the inspiration and/or opportunity for other women in marine sciences." </p><p>Silver will receive the award, a glass jellyfish sculpture and monetary prize, and deliver the award lecture, entitled "Life and Times of a Woman Oceanographer," on March 28 at WHOI. During her visit to Woods Hole, Silver will also meet with WHOI staff and graduate students, and will present an informal science seminar entitled "Eating Well in a Marine Food Web: Those Annoying Algal Toxins." </p><p>"I'm delighted Mary Silver is receiving this honor," said WHOI director Robert Gagosian. "Her contributions to marine science and education, and her leadership in mentoring junior staff, are fitting tributes to the high standards, spirit of collaboration, and strong commitment to the field exemplified by Mary Sears."</p><p>Margaret Delaney, professor and chair of ocean sciences at UCSC, said Silver has combined pioneering contributions to biological oceanography with outstanding teaching, service to the university, and leadership and mentorship of other marine and ocean scientists.</p><p>"Throughout her career, she has been unfailingly generous in providing rigorous academic and scientific mentoring, in giving advice and encouragement, and in opening doors and blazing pathways for those who have followed," Delaney said. "Professor Silver led the way for people with strong family commitments to go to sea, showing that scientists could combine challenging, field-based careers with family life."</p><p>Silver's career in oceanography began in 1964 at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, when she entered the doctoral program in biological oceanography. Her thesis research involved studying the role of a common zooplankton, the salp, as a key herbivore in the California Current. Her research provided some of the first estimates of the feeding capacity of salps, illuminating the critical role of sporadically blooming jelly plankton as major consumers of primary production in this eastern boundary current.</p><p>Silver received her Ph.D. from Scripps in 1971, and in 1972 was appointed assistant professor of marine studies at UCSC, where she has been teaching large nonmajor undergraduate classes as well as specialty upper-division and graduate classes for some 30 years. As the founding member the marine science academic program, she has taught over 4,000 students and has sponsored and encouraged many young marine biologists and oceanographers.</p><p>The work for which Silver is best known, her marine snow studies, began with undergraduate students taking her biological oceanography class in the mid-1970s. It resulted in the first estimates of the abundance of "marine snow"--nonliving particles more than 0.5 millimeters in diameter and readily visible to the unaided eye--and the communities of microorganisms that inhabit them. The research showed that many planktonic organisms thought to be "free-living" actually reside on particles. Because these organisms are abundant and active, the particles are, in fact, semi-isolated microhabitats for dense and unique microbial communities. </p><p>In the late 1990s, Silver began focusing largely on the transfer of phytoplankton toxins through marine food webs, from fish and krill to marine birds and filter-feeding whales. Working with her students, she is studying domoic acid, the recently discovered toxin responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning that is produced by some diatoms, a type of algae. Since the diatoms also flocculate and settle as marine snow particles through the water and onto the underlying sediments, she is also beginning to study the potential contamination of seafloor communities by the algal toxins. </p><p>Silver's work on plankton-derived toxins combines a long-standing interest in the natural history of pelagic or open-ocean communities with her more oceanographically oriented research on material flux. Collaborating with her students and many colleagues in biological and chemical oceanography, Silver hopes to continue work in this more applied area of marine science, addressing problems related to ocean health and the possible involvement of humans in coastal ocean change. </p><p>The Women Pioneer in Oceanography Award was initiated by the WHOI Women's Committee as part of a Women's History Month celebration in March 1994, with Mary Sears its first recipient. Sears, who died in 1997, was one of the first staff members of the institution and a guiding force in its development. The award was later named for her, and Silver is the first recipient of the award named for Sears. Other recipients of the Women Pioneer in Oceanography Award include Elizabeth Bunce of WHOI in 1995, Ruth Turner of Harvard University in 1996, and Marie Tharp of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in 1999.</p><p>The award recognizes long-term life achievement and influence, with special consideration given to candidates who also have shown leadership through mentoring junior scientists, technicians, or students. </p><p>In 1992, Silver received the Henry Bryant Bigelow Medal in Oceanography from WHOI, along with Alice Alldredge of UC Santa Barbara. This award was "in recognition of their creative contributions to biological and chemical oceanography, particularly in demonstrating the importance of 'marine snow' as a major contributor to the vertical flux of particulate matter throughout the world's oceans."</p><p>Mary Sears received her doctoral degree in biology from Radcliffe College in 1933 and went on to pursue a lifelong career in oceanography. She is widely credited with turning a new, obscure field into a prestigious international science, and was the founding and longtime editor of the journal Deep-Sea Research. She also helped to establish the journal Progress in Oceanography, and served as editor of a number of books considered milestones in documenting the history of marine science. As a principal organizer of the first International Oceanographic Congress at the United Nations, she forged many important links with marine scientists around the world. During World War II she organized and led the new Oceanographic Unit of the Navy Hydrographic Office, which provided the foundation for the current Naval Oceanographic Office. As a member of nine scientific and honorary societies and longtime member of the governing board of WHOI, she provided leadership across the field and was an important mentor to generations of young scientists.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bcf468072704601a012ff1e88be70"><name>89</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book reveals conflicted racial identity among white youth</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1016694000000</start-date><display-name>New book reveals conflicted...</display-name><path>/2002/03/89</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/89</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337918715</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337918715</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Teens describe immobilizing guilt, unwanted feelings of racism, and also relief at being white</b></p><p>For white youth, coming to terms with being white in an increasingly diverse U.S. society can be a painful and contradictory experience marked by feelings of guilt and privilege, relief and persistent prejudice.</p><p>In her new book, Shades of White: White Kids and Racial Identities in High School (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2002), sociologist Pamela Perry reveals the complex feelings white youth today have about being white, and she identifies powerful forces in our nation's schools that reproduce racial inequality.</p><p>"As we become a more diverse society, we can't afford to raise our kids in racial isolation," said Perry, an assistant professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We need to understand the formation of racial identity in multiracial settings and what's happening in schools that contributes to racism. In this day and age, schools need to nurture a generation of young people able to live and work together with dignity and respect."</p><p>Perry spent two-and-a-half years immersed in the culture of two northern California high schools to explore the development of racial identity among white youth in schools with very different racial balances. The first school, which she calls "Valley Groves," is a suburban school where 83 percent of the students are non-Hispanic whites. The second, which she calls "Clavey," is urban and racially diverse with 54 percent African American students, 23 percent Asians, 12 percent whites, and 8 percent Hispanics.</p><p>In presenting findings based on participant observation in the schools and in-depth interviews with 60 students, Perry paints a portrait of racial identity formation among whites that varies dramatically by proximity to students of color. She asserts that merely interacting with students of different races and ethnic backgrounds in a multicultural school is not enough to counter the forces of racism that persist in American society. Even in the diverse school, academic tracking and multicultural programming reinforce powerful divisions along racial lines, said Perry. One white girl, disturbed by the negative racial stereotypes and prejudices she held despite life experiences to the contrary, described her confusion and despair by saying, "There's this devil in me." </p><p>Ultimately, Perry concludes that the formation of white racial identity is a textured, complex, and contradictory experience. Being white requires young people to examine their privileged positions in U.S. society, grapple on a daily basis with feelings of guilt and relief, struggle with competing personal and social values, and come to terms with the nation's legacy of racial injustice, about which students of color routinely remind their white peers, Perry observed.</p><p>At Valley Groves, Perry found white students were so steeped in the everyday "normalcy" of white dominance that they experienced what Perry calls a "cognitive gap" when asked about their racial identity. "They expressed egalitarian and antiracist beliefs, but they were so isolated from people of color that they didn't really have a sense of racial inequality," said Perry. Of critical importance, these students reported being uncomfortable and scared around people of color.</p><p>By contrast, for whites at Clavey, racial injustice and white privilege were not abstract ideas. They saw on a daily basis the mistrust with which black and Hispanic kids were treated, and they saw the ways in which they, as whites, benefited from racism. "They saw ongoing forms of discrimination all around them," said Perry. "They understood the need for public policy to address these inequalities."</p><p>Perry also writes of white students whose experiences of being white "took disturbing turns into exasperation, guilt, and sometimes victim-blaming discourses and 'racist' self-images." Whites at Clavey reported having their racial prejudices confirmed at school, where students of color were resegregated by academic tracking policies (although whites made up 12 percent of the school population, they accounted for more than 80 percent of the enrollment in accelerated and advanced-placement courses). </p><p>For students struggling with race issues, tracking reinforced racial stereotypes. "White students came to embrace the hierarchy of academic ability, subscribing to beliefs that they'd earned their place by 'working hard' and that students of color were 'lazy,' and came from families that didn't care about education," writes Perry. Similarly, multicultural programming that spotlights racial and ethnic groups while ignoring people of European backgrounds reinforces notions of "otherness," said Perry. </p><p>Perry concludes that the effects on white students of racial isolation versus diversity made a compelling case for desegregation and integration. But tracking policies and multicultural programming must be reformed to increase opportunities for students of different racial and academic backgrounds to work together as equals toward common goals. Otherwise, like the white students at Clavey, whites in diverse communities--neighborhoods, schools, workplaces--may actually be less racially tolerant and open-minded than those living in racial isolation.</p><p></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Note to journalists: Pamela Perry may be reached at (831) 459-5036, via e-mail at pperry@cats.ucsc.edu, or through Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4399; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914bd0c78072704601a012ff8faed13e"><name>90</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz scientists star in PBS documentary The Shape of Life</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@cats.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1017039600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz scientists...</display-name><path>/2002/03/90</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2002/03/90</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337919095</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337919095</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Shape of Life, a new television documentary series about the diversity of animal life on Earth, features UC Santa Cruz researchers among the scientists who lead viewers on a dramatic exploration of the animal kingdom. The series premieres Tuesday, April 2, on PBS stations nationwide.</p><p>John Pearse, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, played a significant role in planning the series, and is one of the main characters in an episode entitled "The Ultimate Animal." Pearse serves on the board of directors of Sea Studios Foundation, which produced the series for National Geographic Television and Film in association with PBS. </p><p>"I got fairly involved in putting the series together, and in one episode there is quite a bit of me stomping around on the Big Sur coastline, diving around Hopkins [Marine Station], and viewing some old time-lapse films of sea star behavior," Pearse said. </p><p>The first episode, "Origins," features Cristina Diaz, a research associate at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and at the Museo del Mar in Venezuela. Diaz's enthusiasm for the organisms she studies, sponges, is infectious. Most people, if they think about sponges at all, don't think of them as the most exciting creatures on Earth. But if anyone can change people's perceptions of sponges, it is Diaz, who earned her Ph.D. in organismal biology from UCSC. </p><p>"They are beautiful. They're original. They're mysterious. They are hundreds of millions of years old, yet they are still found all over the planet, in every sea," she said. </p><p>Innovative camera techniques, computer animations, and strikingly beautiful underwater video footage help Diaz make her case. The Shape of Life tells the history of animal life on Earth, and in the process it celebrates the unsung heroes of the animal world. Not only sponges, but also worms, jellies, crabs, bugs, snails, and sea stars all get their chance to shine in the limelight. High-definition video photography reveals these often-ignored creatures in all their glory.</p><p>Damhnait McHugh, who earned her Ph.D. in biology at UCSC and is now on the faculty at Colgate University, is also featured in the series, describing the wonders of annelid worms in the episode "Explosion of Life."</p><p>The Shape of Life consists of eight one-hour episodes. It will air in two-hour blocks from 9 to 11 p.m. on April 2, 9, and 16. Two additional episodes will not air with the premiere, but will air locally on PBS affiliates later in April and May.</p><p>Sea Studios Foundation, based in Monterey, is a nonprofit organization specializing in natural history and science programming. Staff scientists and award-winning filmmakers work together at the foundation, which was formed in 1996.

<p>UCSC, with an enrollment just over 13,000, ranks eighth in the nation in the number of former students helping around the world in the Peace Corps. The number one university in Peace Corps volunteers is the University of Wisconsin at Madison, with 41,219 students.</p>
<p>"Throughout the years, your institution has made a tremendous contribution to this agency's legacy of public service," Peace Corps Chief of Staff Lloyd Pierson wrote to UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "The important role that these students play in promoting hope, opportunity, and freedom cannot be underestimated in this time of adversity." UCSC was also ranked eighth in 2001.</p>
<p>In the 41 years that the Peace Corps has been sending volunteers overseas, almost all have been college graduates. Today, 95 percent of Peace Corps Volunteers hold at least bachelor's degrees.</p>
<p>Since 1961, more than 165,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers in 135 different countries around the world. Approximately 7,000 volunteers are now at work in 70 countries, sharing their skills and their culture.</p>
<p>Other University of California institutions in the top 20 were UC Berkeley (3), UC Davis (10), UC Santa Barbara (15) and UCLA (16).</p>
<p>The top ten universities, their number of volunteers and their enrollments are:</p>
