King listed several civil rights issues that deeply concerned him and said, "I have a nightmare."</p><p>Bond admonished him to look at it more positively.  </p><p>"No, don't you mean, 'I have a dream'?" said Bond, a smile twisting his lips. As the audience laughed, he said, "I'm sensing doubt."   </p><p>The grandson of a man born into slavery, Bond helped found the Atlanta student sit-in and anti-segregation organization and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960 while a student at Morehouse. As SNCC's communications director, he was active in protests and voter registration campaigns throughout the South.</p><p>Elected in 1965 to the Georgia House of Representatives, Bond was prevented from taking his seat by members who objected to his opposition to the Vietnam War. He was re-elected to his own vacant seat and un-seated again, and was finally seated only after a third election and a unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court.</p><p>He is a distinguished professor at American University in Washington, D.C., and a professor in history at the University of Virginia. He has served since 1998 as chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the United States, and he continues to write and lecture about the history of the civil rights movement and the condition of African Americans and the poor.</p><p>In 2002, he received the National Freedom Award.</p><p>UC Santa Cruz officials expressed their pleasure at Bond's presence at the event in their opening remarks. </p><p>"I'm delighted a person of the national eminence of Julian Bond has agreed to be our speaker this evening," said Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p><p> </p><p>"History is race," said Bond after the crowd's laughter subsided following his opening story, reciting a litany of charged words: slaveholders, Civil War, Jim Crow, Ku Klux Klan, and Jena. </p><p>And yet, he said, the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. is especially evident this year, with a black man, a woman, and only one white male running for the presidential nomination of the Democratic party. </p><p>But the election system in this country is broken, said Bond, tall,  with white hair, a distinguished bearing, and a deep orator's voice. He denounced the weight and importance given to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, saying those states are mostly white and don't represent an accurate picture of the nation.</p><p>"Front-loading is good for washing machines," said Bond, "but terrible for elections."</p><p>Bond has been a critic of the Bush administration since it began, and he had strong words for the president again Wednesday night, saying, "we're going to speak truth to power until they leave town." </p><p>"President Bush said he wanted to be a uniter. It took him seven years, but boy, has he succeeded," said Bond. "He has united Americans around a desire for change. He has united Americans in our anxiety about our economic well-being and whether, perchance, the American dream is over; about an unpopular war of choice; and about America's reduced standing in the world."</p><p>Bond called the Iraq War "such an abomination it's almost beyond mention" and cited statistics illustrating the disparity in economic well-being between blacks and whites. </p><p>Affirmative action is under attack not because it failed but because it succeeded, he said, and it must be restored. </p><p>"We have a long and honorable tradition of social justice in this country," said Bond. "If we act together, we can overcome."  </p><p>Also at the event, organizers paid tribute to the memory of the late Tony Hill, the prominent local community activist and longtime member of the convocation planning committee who died in August at 62.</p><p>Hill's friend, George Ow Jr., and his widow, Melanie Stern-Hill, announced the establishment of the annual Tony Hill Award, to be given at each Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation to a person who exemplifies Hill's life and work in the community. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155061e8072704601a012ff9485a24e"><name>1916</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1201849200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1916</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1916</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338522607</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338522607</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

Pictures; Dylan Wilcox (Cowell '98), Director of WorldWide Acquisitions for Universal Pictures Group; Tamara Maloney (Merrill '97), an independent producer, editor and director; and Mo Perkins (Kresge '97), an award-winning filmmaker. </p><p>Together, they engaged in a freewheeling conversation for nearly two hours in  front of a rapt audience of more than 40 UCSC film students. All four guests were extremely knowledgeable and heavily immersed in the fine art of writing, directing, producing, distributing, and promoting motion pictures. </p><p>"What a wonderful opportunity it was for our current students to hear from recent alums about the range of experiences they've had in the film business-whether working for Hollywood studios or going the Indie route, working in film production or in distribution and marketing," observed Film and Digital Media Department chair Shelley Stamp. "They all drew such thoughtful connections to the work they did here at UCSC too, so it made me feel like we're really doing something right in nurturing an intense passion for cinema," she added. </p><p>Schechter now oversees more than 20 films in various stages of development and production at Warner Bros. They range from <i>Spring Breakdown</i>, a comedy starring Amy Poehler and Parker Posey, to an upcoming film about Nelson Mandela set to star Morgan Freeman and be directed by Clint Eastwood. Before joining Warner Bros, Schechter was a Creative Executive at Barry Mendel Productions at Universal Pictures where she oversaw <i>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</i> and worked on films such as <i>Munich</i> and <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>.  </p><p>"I didn't think when I went to UC Santa Cruz that I wanted to be a studio executive; I don't even think I knew what that was," Schecter noted. "But the reason that I've done well in my job is that I'm able to clearly articulate an opinion about films-both artistically and commercially."</p><p>"The best thing I did in college was to see a lot of movies and talk about them critically," she added. "Because you learn the language of filmmaking and it helps on sets and in talking to people in the business; it's the best groundwork for working in film and a way to make connections with filmmakers that you're excited to meet."</p><p>Wilcox spends his days looking for independent films to distribute domestically through Focus Features and Rogue Pictures-both divisions of Universal Pictures. He also searches for movies that Universal International can distribute overseas. Wilcox advised students to get as much experience as possible in a wide variety of jobs as they make their way through the film world.</p><p>"When I went to school here, I didn't realize there was a job out there where you watch a lot of movies and go to film festivals," said Wilcox. "There's no need to put all of your eggs into one basket-think of each project as a stepping stone. Stick to something that moves you and use it as a building block for your next job."</p><p>Perkins took a different route to moving up in the business. After graduating from UCSC, she earned a masters degree in directing at UCLA, where she was the recipient of numerous awards. In addition to directing short films, Perkins began writing screenplays. <i>A Quiet Little Marriage</i>, now in post-production, is her feature directorial debut. </p><p>"It's a tricky road because there's not really a direct path to success in this business-we all make our own way," Perkins said. "After grad school at UCLA, I made it my mission <u>not</u> to get a job; my major focus was to write feature scripts. As a director or writer, you need to have something to show-nobody will just give you a project, there's too much money involved. So my advice is to create things-put your heart into it."</p><p>After graduating from UCSC, Maloney did an internship at Lucas Films, worked for <i>TV Guide</i>, collaborated with Academy Award-winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler on his documentary feature <i>Who Needs Sleep?</i> (Sundance 2006), and edited <i>American Zombie</i>, which will hit theaters in March after a successful festival run. Her experience even includes a stint working on reality TV. </p><p>"I did casting for <i>Survivor</i> and I learned so much from that job," said Maloney. "It's important to do all sorts of jobs and try new things-it all adds up to your experience and develops your communication skills." </p><p>"I really thrived at UCSC--on the passion and love for what we were doing here," she added. "I spent so much time watching movies in the library. We would just eat, breathe, and live film."</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91550ef18072704601a012fff747df82"><name>1922</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hundreds attend Seventh Annual Campus Earth Summit</title><summary>The Seventh Annual Campus Earth Summit January 31 featured speakers, exhibits, workshops, organic food, and a few hecklers.

Several hundred students, staff, and faculty participated.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal announced during his address that Lisa Sloan, dean of graduate education and an expert on climate change, and Daniel Press, chair of the Environmental Studies Department, will co-chair his new Chancellor's Advisory Council on Climate Change.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said the still-forming council would begin with three demonstration projects that respond to policy goals of the UC system, the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, and the local Climate Compact he signed in September with Santa Cruz city and county leaders.</p>
<p>Blumenthal made his comments after being heckled briefly by a handful of people upon his introduction. Student Affairs officials identified them as being supporters of people trespassing in trees above a Science Hill parking lot. Blumenthal said he is committed as chancellor to sustainability on campus, calling it "vital for the long-term future of the campus and the long-term future of the planet." He outlined more than a dozen actions already taken.</p>
<p>In an experiment last week, UCSC Dining Services tried "tray-less Tuesday" at Porter Dining Hall, an effort to reduce food waste and energy use. Compared with a two-hour waste audit a year ago, the experiment found that when trays were taken away, scraps declined from an average of 3.2 ounces per person to 2.3 ounces, a 28 percent reduction, said Candy Berlin, program coordinator for Dining Services.</p>
<p>"The potential for reduction is huge," she said, explaining that Dining Services serves 8,500 meals a day on campus. Not only does going tray-less save food, but soap and water use, and the energy needed to heat it for cleaning, are reduced, she said.</p>
<p>Colleges around the country are moving to tray-less food service for the same reasons. This month the University of Connecticut is trying a three-week experiment.</p>
<p>"Food trays lead to increased food waste," Berlin said. Porter College is unique in that student practice is to eat directly off the trays, eschewing plates, Berlin said. "We kind of messed with their culture," she said, but noted few complaints. Dining Services moved to smaller trays this year at the Crown/Merrill dining hall.</p>
<p>During his keynote address, Santa Cruz County Treasurer Fred Keeley called for personal and governmental action on sustainability. "We know what the solutions are," he said. "The question is whether there is the political will and the economic will" to do something. "It is a moral issue to fix the problem so you can hand this planet to the next generation better than you found it."</p>
<p>Other speakers included Matt St. Clair, sustainability manager for the UC Office of the President; Ben Allen, student regent; Aurora Winslade, UCSC sustainability manager; and Daniel Press.</p>

(Photos by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC has thrown down the gauntlet (and will put it in the recycling bin later) by entering for the first time in ReycleMania, an annual friendly competition among college and university recycling programs nationwide.</p>
<p>The 2008 competition has officially started, with more than 400 schools across the country participating to see who can motivate their campus communities to recycle more and reduce overall waste over a 10-week period. The contest began Jan. 27, and <a href="http://www.recyclemaniacs.org/results.asp">initial rankings</a> were posted Feb. 8.</p>
<p>Results will be reported weekly on Fridays on the RecycleMania <a href="http://recyclemania.org/">web site</a>.</p>
<p>"We want to get involved and start a stronger culture of recycling on campus, and we thought this would be a way to do it," said UCSC Recycling Coordinator Dave Wade.</p>
<p>RecycleMania has <a href="http://www.myspace.com/recyclemania">MySpace</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=727341971">Facebook</a> pages to help schools network and to promote the competition and waste reduction. And Wade is looking into other promotional ideas to get people recycling, such as tabling.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Grounds Services Recycling Program is setting out more containers to handle the anticipated increase in recycling material, hiring more student assistants to help with the pickups, and dedicating more equipment to transport the additional amounts of recycling it expects.</p>
<p>"We have every expectation that we will have a huge response throughout campus to this competition," said Dean Raven, grounds manager.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the competition is to increase recycling awareness, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for a little smack-talk.</p>
<p>Last year, UC Davis, a contestant since 2004, chided RecycleMania rookie Stanford University by making a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo8uIfvFz9U">YouTube video</a> that called the Cardinals "newbies."</p>
<p>"We had a little fun," said Lin King, program manager for the R4 Recycling Program at UC Davis, with a laugh. "But it's more for educational promotion, and that's what we use it for. It's not so much to go out there and be number one--although we wouldn't mind."</p>
<p>The video, though in jest, served its purpose.</p>
<p>"That riled some people up," said Julie Muir, community relations manager for Peninsula Sanitary Service, Inc., Stanford Recycling Center.</p>
<p>She'd been egged on by her colleagues at Harvard and Yale for many years to get on board with RecycleMania, said Muir.</p>
<p>As it turned out, she said, "people just loved it. I can't express how surprised I was that they weren't offended by it, they weren't pooh-poohing it, they wanted to know where we were in the standings. But it was also very humbling because we didn't win."</p>
<p>Stanford did make a fine showing, however, coming in second in the "Gorilla Prize," which honors the school that recycles the highest gross tonnage of materials during the competition, and third in the "Targeted Material--Paper" category.</p>
<p>During the competition, campuses go head-to-head in different contests to see which institution can collect the largest amount of recyclables per capita, the largest amount of total recyclables, the least amount of trash per capita, or have the highest recycling rate.</p>
<p>The per capita competitions level the playing field, said Wade.</p>
<p>"That way a small school can compete with a larger school," he said.</p>
<p>RecycleMania began in 2001 when Ed Newman of Ohio University and Stacy Edmonds Wheeler of Miami University decided that something had to be done to increase recycling in the residence and dining halls on their campuses. The first year, Miami University won the competition over Ohio University.</p>
<p>Since then, the program grew rapidly in participants each year and expanded to include various contests. In 2007, the number of contestants more than doubled over the previous year, with 201 schools battling for RecycleMania glory. That year, the effort produced 41.3 million total pounds of recycled materials, up from approximately 18 million pounds in 2006.</p>
<p>This year, the number of competing schools has doubled again. Participating schools in California have quadrupled, going from 8 in 2007 to 32 this year.</p>
<p>Only Montana, Nebraska, Kansas, and Alaska do not have participating schools.</p>
<p>Beside UCSC and Davis, UCs competing are Irvine, Merced, San Diego, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Big-name schools are in the game, including Rutgers, Harvard, and Princeton, but so are less-well-known institutions: Agnes Scott College in Georgia, for example, and Bemidji State University in Minnesota.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise awareness and get students, faculty, and staff recycling, UCSC's Wade said.</p>
<p>"Recycle," he said, when asked how the campus community can help the cause. "Recycle every day. Recycle all your bottles and cans. Recycle all your paper. If you have to take an extra step to do that, do it anyway."</p>
<p>But hey, it's a competition. Winning would be great, too, and Wade is setting his sights high.</p>
<p>"In my heart of hearts, I'd really like to beat Davis," said Wade, referring to the school known for environmentally forward practices such as instituting a zero-waste policy at its football stadium.</p>
<p>But, he laughed, "we don't have a prayer."</p>

The January 25, 2008, issue of the journal includes their report on a study of the birds' mating behavior, and the cover features Lyon's photo of a male lark bunting. <i>Science</i>, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), has the largest paid circulation of any peer-reviewed general science journal in the world, with an estimated total readership of one million.</p><p>Chaine and Lyon looked at how female lark buntings choose their mates. The researchers found that females show strong preferences for certain traits in the males, such as flashy white wing patches, but the preferred traits change from year to year, perhaps in response to shifting environmental conditions. The findings show a surprising level of flexibility in the females, who enhance their nesting success by choosing mates with the right traits.</p><p>For a more detailed description of the study, see the recent <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1888">UCSC story</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91551dc08072704601a012ff7590bf12"><name>1933</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's Banana Slug among ESPN's top 10 best team names</title><summary>UCSC's Banana Slug mascot has been named among the top 10 best team nicknames in college basketball by ESPN Sports Travel.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Banana Slug, ESPN Sports Travel</keywords><description>UCSC's Banana Slug mascot has been named among the top 10 best team nicknames in college basketball by ESPN Sports Travel.</description><start-date>1202281200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC's Banana Slug among...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1933</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1933</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338528650</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338528650</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/sammy.slug.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/sammy.slug.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammy.slug.200.jpg</name><file-size>5622</file-size><width>200</width><height>174</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sammy Slug: Yellow, slimy, slow, and totally awesome. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It's slimy, yellow, and slow--and it's one of the best mascots in the country.</p><p>UCSC's Banana Slug mascot has been named one of the 10 best team nicknames in college basketball by ESPN Sports Travel.</p><p>For the full story on the Slugs, along with other creative team names, photographs, and runners-up, see the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=3224604">ESPN article</a>.</p><p>UCSC's athletic director, Linda Spradley, said the recognition will raise national awareness about UCSC sports--and believes the Banana Slug is a fitting symbol for the entire campus. </p><p>"The Banana Slug is indigenous to our area, it's prolific here, and it speaks to the entire campus--not just athletics," said Spradley.</p><p>"And," she added, "our athletes love it."</p><p>The Slugs made the list alongside other unique team names, including the Concordia College Cobbers (a snarling ear of corn, wearing a maroon sweater and a green husk for trousers) and the Evergreen State College Geoducks (the largest burrowing clam in the world).</p><p>The Banana Slug served as the unofficial nickname of UC Santa Cruz for nearly two decades.

The first step is to assess the natural endowments of a region, including the presence of surface and groundwater, the amount and timing of rainfall, and the overall water quality. Second, the long-term health of these assets is evaluated. Researchers then review the economic and social needs, as well as the long-term goals, of a region before evaluating whether existing rules, mandates, and administrative bodies are helping or hindering the achievement of the region's goals.  </p><p>"This integrated and interdisciplinary approach allows us to generate policy and management recommendations that are tailored to help cities and regions achieve their specific goals," said Haddad. "If we know anything about water issues, it's that they defy a one-size-fits-all approach."</p><p> </p><p>Informing the public and involving residents in water-management policymaking is critical to municipal and regional success, noted Haddad. "Water is a lightning-rod issue. It's not enough to assess the situation and draft a policy," he said. "The public needs to be engaged. Transparency and communication are absolutely as important as engineering and economics." </p><p>The center is working on several projects in California, including one in Monterey County where senior resource economist Steven Kasower is facilitating a dialogue on long-term water-supply planning. If successful, Haddad said the effort could save the county more than $100 million by improving its infrastructure investment choices. </p><p>Haddad is a leading expert on water policy and management. The author of <i>Rivers of Gold: Designing Markets to Allocate Water in California</i> (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2000), he advocates a shift away from polarizing debates over water use toward an integrated approach that encompasses environmental, economic, and population needs. "Our goal is to help regions, states, and nations make good choices about water supply and water quality," he said. "We focus on applied problems and build theory out of specific cases."</p><p>UCSC is the perfect campus to host the new center's interdisciplinary approach to water issues, said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences. "Today's water-supply issues revolve around the distribution of a limited resource," said Kamieniecki. "By learning from and sharing our expertise with water agencies, we will help ensure the development of sustainable systems that meet both societal and environmental needs." </p><p> </p><p>More information about CIWR is available on the project's <a href=" http://ciwr.ucsc.edu/desalplanning/index.html">web site</a>.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to reporters</b>: You may contact Haddad at (831) 459-4149 or bhaddad@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915523b08072704601a012ff902e491b"><name>1937</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1202454000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1937</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1937</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338530150</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338530150</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

(Photos by Matt Fitt)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nearly 250 people attended the fifth annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner Saturday, raising an estimated $160,000 for undergraduate scholarships. </p><p>Keynote speaker Camryn Manheim, an Emmy-winning television actor and 1984 graduate of Porter College, told dinner guests at the campus's University Center that UC Santa Cruz "gave me every tool that I needed to pursue my dream."</p><p>In her very personal address, alternately funny and serious, Manheim recalled hitchhiking to Santa Cruz in the summer of 1978 at the urging of the Flying Karamazov Brothers (the comic juggling troupe, that includes UCSC grads), whom she'd met at a southern California performance. After attending Cabrillo College to fulfill her language requirement--two classes of American Sign Language in one semester, a B+ in the afternoon beginning class and an A- in the morning intermediate session--she enrolled at UCSC.</p><p>She also got involved in the Myth California protest pageant--a backlash against the Miss California Pageant long held annually in Santa Cruz--organized by Nikki Craft, a UCSC student. "I got an academic education from the city on the hill and an activist education on the streets of Santa Cruz," Manheim said. </p><p>She said she acquired chutzpah and a belief she could do anything. When she left UCSC for graduate school,"I believed in myself," she said. </p><p>Manheim thanked scholarship donors for making UCSC accessible for students who might not otherwise be able to afford to attend. </p><p>Precious Ward, a 2006 Oakes College graduate, also spoke of her time at UCSC as being transformative. She said she represents "the foster youth, the youth who reside in group homes, the orphans, and the runaways who aspire for a better life but lack the resources.</p><p>"I represent those who have struggled and survived, struggled and survived a thousand times over," Ward said. She received a variety of scholarships during her UCSC years and personally thanked the many individuals who helped her along the way. </p><p>She told the audience, "it may appear as though you are just writing a check, but I assure you that scholarships create a chain of effects." </p><p>Ward now attends New York University, working toward a master's degree in nonprofit management. She hopes eventually to run an agency to help disadvantaged people realize their goals. </p><p>Chancellor George Blumenthal and his wife, Kelly Weisberg, spoke of the need for scholarship funds and the enormous benefits they can achieve. Weisberg, a law professor at Hastings College of the Law, noted how she relied on scholarships to complete her education after the death of her father when she was 19.</p><p>For the first time, donors provided a matching gift. Hierarchical Systems Research Foundation and an alumni donor committed $25,000 to match any first-time donations and increased gifts. Also for the first time, an online auction contributed to the proceeds. </p><p>Guests included UCSC alumni and supporters from around the region and across the state, as well as local residents and members of the campus community. </p><p>Earlier in the day, Manheim participated in a free, public <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1923">question-and-answer session</a> hosted by UCSC media expert L.

<p>The detailed images from Hubble's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) reveal an infant galaxy, dubbed A1689-zD1, undergoing a firestorm of star birth during the dark ages, a time shortly after the Big Bang but before the first stars reheated the cold, dark universe. Images from the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera provided strong additional evidence that it was a young star-forming galaxy in the dark ages.</p>
<p>"We certainly were surprised to find such a bright young galaxy 13 billion years in the past," said Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a member of the research team. "This is the most detailed look to date at an object so far back in time."</p>
<p>"The Hubble images yield insight into the galaxy's structure that we cannot get with any other telescope," added astronomer Rychard Bouwens, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and one of the co-discoverers of this galaxy.</p>
<p>The new images should offer insights into the formative years of galaxy birth and evolution and yield information on the types of objects that may have contributed to ending the dark ages. The faraway galaxy also is an ideal target for Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled to launch in 2013.</p>
<p>During its lifetime, the Hubble telescope has peered ever farther back in time, viewing galaxies at successively younger stages of evolution. These snapshots have helped astronomers create a scrapbook of galaxies from infancy to adulthood. The new Hubble and Spitzer images of A1689-zD1 show a time when galaxies were in their infancy.</p>
<p>Current theory holds that the dark ages began about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, as matter in the expanding universe cooled and formed clouds of cold hydrogen. These cold clouds pervaded the universe like a thick fog. At some point during this era, stars and galaxies started to form. Their collective light reheated the foggy, cold hydrogen, ending the dark ages about a billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>"This galaxy presumably is one of the many galaxies that helped end the dark ages," said astronomer Larry Bradley of Johns Hopkins University, who led the study. "Astronomers are fairly certain that high-energy objects such as quasars did not provide enough energy to end the dark ages of the universe. But many young star-forming galaxies may have produced enough energy to end it."</p>
<p>The galaxy is so far away it did not appear in images taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, because its light is stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths by the universe's expansion. It took Hubble's NICMOS, Spitzer, and a trick of nature called gravitational lensing to see the faraway galaxy.</p>
<p>Astronomers used a relatively nearby massive cluster of galaxies known as Abell 1689, roughly 2.2 billion light-years away, to magnify the light from the more distant galaxy directly behind it. This natural telescope is called a gravitational lens.</p>
<p>Though the diffuse light of the faraway object is nearly impossible to see, gravitational lensing has increased its brightness by nearly 10 times, making it bright enough for Hubble and Spitzer to detect. A telltale sign of the lensing is the smearing of the images of galaxies behind Abell 1689 into arcs by the gravitational warping of space by the intervening galaxy cluster.</p>
<p>The images reveal bright, dense clumps of hundreds of millions of massive stars in a compact region about 2,000 light-years across, which is only a fraction of the width of our Milky Way Galaxy. This type of galaxy is not uncommon in the early universe, when the bulk of star formation was taking place, Bradley and Illingworth said.</p>
<p>Spitzer's images show that the galaxy's mass is typical to that of galaxies in the early universe. Its mass is equivalent to several billions of stars like our Sun, or just a tiny fraction of the mass of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>"This observation confirms previous Hubble studies that star birth happens in very tiny regions compared with the size of the final galaxy," Illingworth said.</p>
<p>Even with the increased magnification from the gravitational lens, Hubble's sharp "eye" can only see knots of the brightest, heftiest stars in the galaxy. The telescope cannot pinpoint fainter, lower-mass stars, individual stars, or the material surrounding the star-birthing region. To see those things, astronomers will need the infrared capabilities of NASA's JWST. The planned infrared observatory will have a mirror about seven times the area of Hubble's primary mirror and will collect more light from faint galaxies. JWST also will be able to view even more remote galaxies whose light has been stretched deep into infrared wavelengths that are out of the reach of NICMOS.</p>
<p>"This galaxy will certainly be one of the first objects that will be observed by JWST," said team member Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University. "This galaxy is so bright that JWST will see its detailed structure. This object is a pathfinder for JWST for deciphering what is happening in young galaxies."</p>
<p>The astronomers noted that the faraway galaxy also would be an ideal target for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which, when completed in 2012, will be the most powerful radio telescope in the world.</p>
<p>"ALMA and JWST working together would be an ideal combination to really understand this galaxy," Illingworth said. "JWST's images and ALMA's measurement of the gas motions will provide revolutionary insights into the very youngest galaxies."</p>
<p>The astronomers will conduct follow-up observations with infrared spectroscopy to confirm the galaxy's distance using the Keck telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The results will be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>

The invitation to give the Carson Lecture is an honor that recognizes the professional accomplishments of members of the AGU's Ocean Sciences section. </p><p>Silver, who was elected as an AGU Fellow in 2007, is an internationally recognized leader in biological oceanography. Her current research focuses on harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing marine phytoplankton (microscopic algae). She is particularly interested in determining the environmental conditions that lead to toxin production by phytoplankton and understanding the pathways by which these toxins are transmitted to higher organisms, including humans. </p><p>Silver's pioneering studies of "marine snow," which began in the 1970s, revealed the importance of the small nonliving particles that drift down through the water like snow. She showed that marine snow is a major source of sinking organic matter in the world's oceans and is the site of intense microbial activity. </p><p>Silver has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award in 2002 and the Henry Bryant Bigelow Award in Oceanography in 1992, both given by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She received her bachelor's degree in zoology from UC Berkeley and her Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. Silver joined the UCSC faculty in 1972.</p><p>The Carson Lecture is named in honor of marine biologist Rachel Carson, best known as the author of the book <i>Silent Spring</i>. Published in 1962, it described the environmental damage caused by widespread use of chemical pesticides, led to greater public awareness of the issue, and helped bring about increased regulation of pesticides. Carson wrote several widely read books on the sea and ecological themes, including <i>The Sea Around Us</i> (1951), which received a National Book Award. She taught zoology at the University of Maryland and later worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and its successor, the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91552d2d8072704601a012ff28b9005d"><name>1943</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Incidents of Vandalism and Harassment</title><start-date>1202799600000</start-date><display-name>Incidents of Vandalism and...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1943</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1943</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338532607</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338532607</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are writing to inform you of several recent incidents of intimidation to faculty and staff, purportedly over laboratory research involving animals.

Photo by Tim Stephens.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have received funding from Microsoft Research to develop a virtual speech therapist, accessible on a cell phone, to aid stroke survivors in Malaysia. The self-contained language rehabilitation program will use a computer-generated talking head that provides realistic speech and mimics the natural movements of lips, tongue, and jaw.</p>
<p>About 40,000 people suffer from stroke every year in Malaysia, and communication impairments are common among stroke survivors, said principal investigator Sri Kurniawan, an assistant professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC. As in many developing countries, however, access to speech therapy is limited. A shortage of speech therapists in Malaysia is one obstacle, and patients often have difficulty traveling to existing speech therapy centers.</p>
<p>"This project aims to create a virtual speech therapist on a cell phone," Kurniawan said. "Initially, the patient will meet with a therapist to work out individualized therapy programs. Then the programs will be loaded onto a cell phone and given to the patient."</p>
<p>Kurniawan has teamed up with Dominic Massaro, professor of psychology at UCSC, who has developed computer-assisted speech and language tutors that have been used to help autistic and hearing-impaired children. Massaro's animated tutor, named Baldi, has already been programmed to speak several languages in addition to English, including Arabic and Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>For the speech therapy project, the researchers will program Baldi to speak Malay, adapt the tutor to work on mobile units such as cell phones, and develop the speech therapy programs. The project will also involve developing a standard assessment program for evaluating speech and language impairments in Malay speakers. "Aphasia" is the medical term that encompasses a range of communication impairments commonly affecting stroke survivors.</p>
<p>"Standardized electronic aphasia assessments and rehabilitation programs do not exist in Malay, as far as we know," said Kurniawan, a native Malay speaker from Indonesia.</p>
<p>Massaro said his group has been working to expand the number of languages that Baldi can use (currently 11, including English). The audio component of Baldi's speech is generated by a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizer, and Massaro is currently evaluating existing Malay TTS engines. The visual component involves accurately matching Baldi's lip, tongue, and jaw movements to the Malay phonemes, the individual vocal units from which words are constructed.</p>
<p>"After we get Baldi to speak Malay, the next step is to present it on a mobile unit like a cell phone," Massaro said. "Cell phones are certainly a pervasive technology, so it's exciting to think about using this new platform."</p>
<p>The cell phones can be programmed to self-launch at certain times of the day to deliver the speech therapy lessons, Kurniawan said. Researchers will call the patients periodically to assess their progress. An initial study to evaluate the program will involve 10 stroke survivors with aphasia.</p>
<p>The National Stroke Association of Malaysia and researchers at the University of Malaysia will also be involved in the project, Kurniawan said. She currently has a pilot project in Malaysia using cell phones to conduct speech therapy through telephone consultations. But this approach is limited by the shortage of speech therapists, she said.</p>
<p>"The virtual speech therapist has the potential to really help stroke survivors, not only in Malaysia, but in developing countries in general," Kurniawan said.</p>
<p>The project is supported by a $100,000 gift from the Microsoft Research "Cell Phone as a Platform for Healthcare" program.</p>

Massaro will participate in a panel discussion of advances in language and speech science at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston.</p><p>Massaro has developed computer-assisted speech and language tutors that use natural human speech to model language articulation. This sophisticated technology, which has helped autistic and hearing-impaired children, is now being incorporated into a soon-to-be-released reading intervention program from Scholastic, and the software is being tailored to help with the acquisition of languages, including Arabic.</p><p>"When you're learning a new language, it's helpful to see how the words are formed," said Massaro. "For instance, in Arabic, segments are articulated at the back of the throat." Massaro's facial animation software features a realistic tongue and palate that students can access in dynamic sideview cutaways of the tongue, jaw, and teeth. Combining such visual cues with sound boosts comprehension--and mimics the natural processes that laboratory experiments by Massaro and others have illuminated.</p><p>"People often have difficulty pronouncing and discriminating certain sounds in foreign languages," said W. Lewis Johnson, CEO of Alelo, an interactive computer gaming startup that uses speech recognition to teach foreign languages to players in simulated environments like Iraq. "Baldi (Massaro's animated tutor) is a potentially useful tool for helping language learners to overcome these difficulties."</p><p>During a recent presentation at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, Massaro emphasized the value of an animated tutor in second-language acquisition. "Working with Baldi can be less intimidating because students don't feel shy about making mistakes," he said, adding that students can practice outside the classroom and get feedback when teachers are unavailable.</p><p>"The ability to perceive speech is based on the integration of visual and auditory information," said Massaro, whose Animated Speech Corporation (ASC) has produced software that features an animated tutor that teaches vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and speech articulation. The software is in use by hard-of-hearing students at the Tucker-Maxon Oral School in Portland, Oregon, and the Bay School for autistic children in Santa Cruz. </p><p>#####</p><p><b>Editor's Note</b>: The AAAS panel discussion, "Advances in Language and Speech Science and Technology," will take place on Friday, February 15, from 8:30 to 10 a.m. Massaro also gave a presentation entitled "Embodied Conversational Agents with Realistic Speech and Language" during a news briefing on Thursday, February 14.

Written during the English Civil War, it stresses the necessity of a strong central government in order to avoid chaos and civil war. </p><p>The 357-year-old first edition was purchased by Thorsett's father-in-law, Donald Dewey, while he was studying in London after World War II on the GI Bill. Thorsett noted that the book was banned after publication and much of the first print run was lost in the 1666 Great Fire of London, which led to a quick second printing in England and a third underground printing in Holland. He added that the book has been appraised at $3,500.</p><p>"Although the binding has separated, the book itself is in very good condition," Thorsett said. "It is, however, missing the famous engraved title page that shows Leviathan made up of the bodies of his subjects. Probably this was removed by an earlier owner and separately framed and displayed. With that engraving it would perhaps be worth 10 times as much to a collector."</p><p>Thorsett obtained the book a few years ago, after Dewey died and his wife Ruth gave it to the Thorsett family. The receipt for the purchase (2 pounds!) was still in the <i>Leviathan</i> when they donated it to Special Collections.</p><p>"Holding onto this book from 1651 really feels like holding onto a piece of history," Thorsett observed. "The names of many of its previous owners are inscribed on its front and back pages, along with some impressive quill-work; perhaps one day someone will trace back through these and learn more about its first three centuries before Don found it."</p><p>"Rachel and I gave the book to the library because we felt that it should be in a place where it could be cared for properly, and used and appreciated by students and researchers," he added. "We thought it seemed particularly appropriate that it be given to a great public institution, since it was with public support through the GI Bill that it came into the family. And giving it in memory of Don Dewey gave us a way to remember him along with the book collecting that he enjoyed so much."</p><p>							</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915540448072704601a012ff1454d890"><name>1954</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Doctoral candidate heading to DC after graduation</title><summary>Lauren Malone will be heading to Washington, D.C., after earning a Ph.D. in economics this spring.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-4399; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>malone, economics, LALS, kletzer, remittance, mexico</keywords><description>Lauren Malone will be heading to Washington, D.C., after earning a Ph.D. in economics this spring.</description><start-date>1203577200000</start-date><display-name>Doctoral candidate heading to...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1954</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1954</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338537463</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338537463</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/kletzer_malone.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/kletzer_malone.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kletzer_malone.300.jpg</name><file-size>42960</file-size><width>300</width><height>237</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lori Kletzer, left, and Lauren Malone discuss Malone's job offers.

"The course of my graduate career has provided me with a great skill set, and one that I want to put to greater use than publishing in academic journals," said Malone.</p><p>A fan of microfinance development programs that alleviate poverty by providing tiny grants of $50 and $100 to women in developing countries, Malone had anticipated a career in development-related work--until she spent an intellectually stimulating day this winter at the Center for Naval Analyses, where she will work on issues of labor economics in the context of the Navy and Marine Corps. Likely topics include recruitment and retention, cost-benefit analysis of different types of weaponry acquisitions, as well as evaluations of military health care, retirement, and compensation plans, she said.</p><p>Malone's dissertation research has documented how remittances sent by Mexican migrants working in the United States boost the educational opportunities for children in Mexico--especially when mothers at home in Mexico get to decide how the money will be spent.</p><p>In her analysis of remittance flows, Malone has discovered significant disparities between the spending priorities of mothers and fathers. Mothers, it turns out, are more inclined to invest those earnings in their children's education, while fathers are more likely to invest in farm or household improvements. In addition, mothers have greater control over household spending when the father is absent, and the longer a father is away from home, the higher the educational attainment of his children, she said. </p><p>"These remittance flows are, in fact, being invested in education," said Malone, who earned a B.A. in global economics and Latin American and Latino studies from UCSC in 2003. "That has serious implications for inequality, because one of the best ways to alleviate poverty is to provide people with education. That's how we move people up the income scale."</p><p>Malone's model is the first to incorporate asymmetric parental preferences and actual decisions about how remittances are spent. Her work is based on a sophisticated analysis of survey data gathered from more than 17,000 households in Mexico by the Mexican Migration Project. </p><p>"Lauren is one of the best," said economics professor Kenneth Kletzer, who helped recruit Malone for the graduate program.</p><p>"My interest is international, and UCSC is one of only a few places where you can get a degree in international economics," said Malone, who described the first year of graduate school as "like boot camp." But Malone has done outstanding research and has worked side-by-side with top faculty. </p><p>"There is a tremendous support network from faculty," she said. "They really care about their students and are willing to work with them. There's no weeding out. They truly want everyone to succeed." Of economics professor Lori Kletzer, Malone said simply, "I would never be where I am today without her. Literally, her door is always open. We talk at least twice a week."</p><p>As an undergraduate, Malone concentrated on economics during her first two years at UCSC, spent her junior year in Santiago, Chile, and wrapped up her course work in Latin American and Latino studies (LALS) by the end of her senior year. She discovered a passion for the Spanish language during high school and now speaks it fluently. </p><p>"I came into graduate school knowing what I wanted to do," said Malone. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915541bc8072704601a012ff2c2d40bb"><name>1955</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Who is Sammy Slug?

Sammy the Slug, with his giant yellow body, attentively upright banana slug feelers, and enormous smile, seems like a jolly fellow. But inside, he's just like you and me. </p><p>Human, that is. </p><p>The role of UCSC's beloved mascot, the Banana Slug--aka Sammy--has been filled over the years by various students, faculty, and staff, said Dan Wood, who was executive director of Student Activities from 1984 to 2006. </p><p>"And it's even rumored that high-ranking administrative officials have played Sammy Slug," said Wood with a knowing chuckle.  </p><p>The Slug, a caricature of the quiet, slimy yellow creature indigenous to the dark, moist redwood forests crowning the campus, is popular around the country: It was recently named one of the 10 best team nicknames in college basketball by ESPN Sports Travel (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1933">earlier Currents story</a>).</p><p> </p><p>Sammy is now played by a UCSC sophomore who had been her high school's team mascot for four years, according to Linda Spradley, athletic director, who handles the Sammy mascot suit check-out and cleaning. </p><p>She found the student by having a signup for Sammy at the 2006 Fall Festival. Thirty-two people were interested in the volunteer, unpaid position. Only three had any experience. </p><p>"I gravitated to people who'd done it before," said Spradley. </p><p>But the athletic office gets 15 to 20 requests for Sammy a year, and the student, being busy with academics, is "lucky if she can do two or three," Spradley said. </p><p>That leads to what is perhaps UCSC's best-kept secret: Nearly anyone can play Sammy Slug. </p><p>"People who check him out can have anyone they want in the Sammy suit," said Spradley.</p><p>However, the Sammy actor must be over the age of 16, provide detailed contact and supervisor information, and sign a sheet agreeing to requirements for appropriate behavior. Sammy cannot be seen drinking a beer or smoking a cigarette, for example. </p><p>The suit rental is free. </p><p>Replacing a Sammy suit would cost $7,000 to $10,000, according to Spradley. And since it's custom made, even a lost boot or glove would require purchasing an entire new suit. </p><p>Whether played by the student or someone else, Sammy regularly shows up at events put on by campus organizations, such as the UCSC Women's Club <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1884">Santa Cruz Chocolate Festival</a> and UCSC Student Volunteer Center holiday food drive. But he also makes appearances at a few community events, including Omega Nu's annual Ducky Derby fundraiser in Santa Cruz. </p><p>"The fact that we have 15 or 18 requests a year, what does that say?" said Spradley. "People like him there."</p><p>And demand is growing. Already this year, Spradley has gotten 12 requests for Sammy's lemon-yellow, megawatt-smile presence. </p><p>She wants to drum up school spirit by having Sammy at more sporting events, but resources are tight. And there used to be another Sammy suit--a meaner, leaner, more-aggressive version of the generally mellow, happy Slug--but it was checked out and never returned several years ago.  </p><p>"We'd like to do a lot more things with Sammy, but we're not there yet with staff," said Spradley. </p><p>Another Sammy suit is imperative to more Sammy sightings, said Spradley, in addition to more staff to handle bookings. </p><p>But even with the staff and suit limitations, "look at the tremendous publicity we get nationally," said Spradley. "ESPN has featured us, Animal Planet has featured us. We get national coverage because of our Slug." </p><p>As the story goes, the Banana Slug was the unofficial mascot for UC Santa Cruz's co-ed teams since the university's early years. The students' adoption of such a lowly creature for a team mascot was their counterculture reaction to the fierce athletic competition fostered at most American universities.</p><p> </p><p>In 1980, when some campus teams wanted more organized yet still low-key participation in extramural competition, UCSC joined Division III of the NCAA in five sports. Since the application required an official team name, UCSC's then-chancellor polled the student players, and out of this small group emerged a consensus for a new moniker--the Sea Lions. It was a choice that the chancellor considered more dignified and suitable to serious play than the Banana Slugs.</p><p> </p><p>But students would have none of it, and they continued to root for the Slugs even after a sea lion was painted in the middle of the basketball floor.</p><p>After five years of dealing with the two-mascot problem, an overwhelming pro-Slug straw vote by students in 1986 convinced the chancellor to make the humble but adored Banana Slug UCSC's official mascot. </p><p>During those turbulent times, "I got calls from five different states saying, 'What the heck is going on?'" recalled Wood.</p><p>In May 1986, <i>People</i> magazine dedicated a full-page spread to the Santa Cruz Banana Slug movement. </p><p>In 1992, the Santa Cruz Banana Slug was named the nation's top mascot by the National Directory of College Athletics. That same year, <i>Sports Illustrated</i> magazine also named the Banana Slug the nation's best college nickname. </p><p>The quirky history is part of what makes Sammy so beloved. But there's something else there, too, something inherent to the mucusy, outrageously colored, peaceful little animal in the redwoods. </p><p>"He's a very endearing character," said Spradley. "When you look at the Sammy mascot, he's hilarious. Even the name Banana Slug makes you laugh your head off." </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155433a8072704601a012ff665d6f6f"><name>1956</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Toolkit makes finding business information easier</title><summary>The revised Staff Toolkit web site makes it easier to find detailed information on the web on buying, event planning, facilities, finance, people, campus safety and security, technology, and travel.</summary><keywords>staff toolkit</keywords><description>The revised Staff Toolkit web site makes it easier to find detailed information on the web on buying, event planning, facilities, finance, people, campus safety and security, technology, and travel.</description><start-date>1203058800000</start-date><display-name>Staff Toolkit makes finding...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1956</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1956</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338538238</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338538238</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Staff asked for an easier way to find the business information they need to do their jobs.

A similarly massive release of carbon accompanied an extreme period of global warming 55 million years ago known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM).</p>
<p>Scientists studying the PETM are piecing together an increasingly detailed picture of its causes and consequences. Their findings describe what may be the best analog in the geologic record for the global changes likely to result from continued carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, according to James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"All the evidence points to a massive release of carbon at the PETM, and if you compare it with the projections for anthropogenic carbon emissions, it's roughly the same amount of carbon," Zachos said. "The difference is the rate at which it was released--we're on track to do in a few hundred years what may have taken a few thousand years back then."</p>
<p>Zachos and his collaborators have been studying marine sediments deposited on the deep ocean floor during the PETM and recovered in sediment cores by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. He will discuss their findings, which reveal drastic changes in ocean chemistry during the PETM, in a presentation at the annual meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston on Friday, February 15. His talk is part of a symposium entitled "Ocean Acidification and Carbon-Climate Connections: Lessons from the Geologic Past."</p>
<p>The ocean has the capacity to absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But as carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean, it makes the water more acidic. That, in turn, could make life more difficult for corals and other marine organisms that build shells and skeletons out of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>Technically, the "acidification" is a lowering of the pH of ocean water, moving it closer to the acidic range of the pH scale, although it remains slightly alkaline. Lowering the pH affects the chemical equilibrium of the ocean with respect to calcium carbonate, reducing the concentration of carbonate ions and making it harder for organisms to build and maintain structures of calcium carbonate. Corals and some other marine organisms use a form of calcium carbonate called aragonite, which dissolves first, while many others build shells of a more resistant form called calcite.</p>
<p>"As the carbonate concentration starts to decrease, it becomes harder for some organisms to build their shells. They have to use more energy, and eventually it's impossible--in laboratory experiments, they precipitate some shell during the day, and overnight it dissolves," Zachos said. "If you lower the carbonate concentration enough, corals and eventually even calcite shells start to dissolve."</p>
<p>The effect of ocean acidification on the chemistry of calcium carbonate is reflected in the sediment cores from the PETM. Marine sediments are typically rich in calcium carbonate from the shells of marine organisms that sink to the seafloor after they die. Sediments deposited at the start of the PETM, however, show an abrupt transition from carbonate-rich ooze to a dark-red clay layer in which the carbonate shells are completely gone (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=706">earlier press release</a>).</p>
<p>Ocean acidification starts at the surface, where carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere, and spreads to the deep sea as surface waters mix with deeper layers. The calcium carbonate in marine sediments on the seafloor provides a buffer, neutralizing the increased acidity as the shells dissolve and enabling the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. But the mixing time required to bring acidified surface waters into the deep sea is long--500 to 1,000 years, according to Zachos.</p>
<p>"We are adding all this carbon dioxide in less than one mixing cycle. That's important for how the ocean buffers itself, and it means the carbonate concentration in surface waters will get low enough to affect corals and other organisms, assuming emissions continue on the current trajectory," he said.</p>
<p>In a recent article in <i>Nature</i> (January 17, 2008), Zachos and coauthors Gerald Dickens of Rice University and Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii provided an overview of the PETM and other episodes of greenhouse warming in the past 65 million years. These "natural experiments" can help scientists understand the complex interactions that link the carbon cycle and the climate.</p>
<p>Christina Ravelo, a professor of ocean sciences at UCSC and coorganizer of the symposium at which Zachos will speak, said climate records preserved in seafloor sediments provide a valuable test for the climate models scientists use to predict the future consequences of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>"There are no exact analogs in the past for what is happening now, but we can use past climates to test the models and improve them," Ravelo said. "The ocean drilling program is the only way to get really good records of these past warm periods."</p>
<p>Current climate models tend to have difficulty replicating the features of warm periods in the past, such as the PETM, she said. "Even though the models do a great job of simulating the climate over the past 150 years, the future probably holds many climatic surprises. As you run the models farther into the future, the uncertainties become greater."</p>
<p>A particular concern over the long run is the potential for positive feedback that could amplify the initial warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. For example, one possible cause of the PETM is the decomposition of methane deposits on the seafloor, which could have been triggered by an initial warming. Methane hydrates are frozen deposits found in the deep ocean near continental margins. Methane released from the deposits would react with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Both compounds are potent greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>"We have some new evidence that there was a lag between the initial warming and the main carbon excursion of the PETM," said Zachos, who is a coauthor of a paper describing these findings in the December 20/27, 2007, issue of <i>Nature</i>. "It's consistent with the notion of a positive feedback, with an initial warming causing the hydrates to decompose," he said.</p>
<p>Although this raises the possibility that the current global warming trend might trigger a similar release of methane from the ocean floor, that would not happen any time soon. It would take several centuries for the warming to reach the deeper parts of the ocean where the methane hydrate deposits are, Zachos said.</p>
<p>"By slowing the rate of carbon emissions and warming, we may be able to avoid triggering a strong, uncontrolled positive feedback," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915546718072704601a012ff80b0e8e1"><name>1958</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earth scientist James Zachos elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</title><summary>James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>James Zachos, AGU</keywords><description>James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).</description><start-date>1203058800000</start-date><display-name>Earth scientist James Zachos...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1958</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1958</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338539049</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338539049</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/zachos_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/zachos_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zachos_200.jpg</name><file-size>55811</file-size><width>200</width><height>268</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>James Zachos</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

An outline of campus spring yield events can be found at <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springyield08">http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springyield08</a>.</p><p>This year we are inaugurating "UC Santa Cruz - Spring Spotlight" from April 5 to April 19. This period will be similar to previous years, except that only admitted students and their families will be invited. During the Spring Spotlight period, the regular Campus Tour Program will be suspended. After admissions decisions are released March 15, if students contact you about campus tours, please refer them to the Admissions web site at <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu">http://admissions.ucsc.edu</a>, where they will find instructions for reserving a place in a Spring Spotlight or regular tour.</p><p>In spite of restricting Spring Spotlight to admitted students and their guests, we will still see a large increase in visitors in April. These visitors will be curious about university life and academic opportunities, and may ask you many questions. Please be patient. Your helpfulness will be a key indicator of our university community for these students and their families. Also, if you see individuals or groups who look like they are lost, please help them find their way. If you see items around campus that need attention, please contact Assistant Director of Admissions Beatrice Atkinson-Myers (ext. 9-2352), who will work with the appropriate unit(s) to help make our visitors' experience the best possible.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your support during this important season.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Richard Hughey, Professor and Chair, Computer Engineering Chair, Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid Michael McCawley, Acting Director of Admissions</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91554b578072704601a012ff425cb3f8"><name>1961</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC signs cooperative agreement with Korean University</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal signed an academic cooperation agreement with representatives of a Korean Buddhist University that calls for the reciprocal exchange of faculty, staff, and students; joint research projects; and the exchange of academic publications </summary><keywords>blumenthal, Dongguk, Seoul, Korean, exchange, university extension,</keywords><description>Chancellor Blumenthal signed an academic cooperation agreement with representatives of a Korean Buddhist University that calls for the reciprocal exchange of faculty, staff, and students; joint research projects; and the exchange of academic publications </description><start-date>1203058800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC signs cooperative agreement...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1961</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1961</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338540319</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338540319</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/blumenthal.kim.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/blumenthal.kim.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blumenthal.kim.300.jpg</name><file-size>13508</file-size><width>300</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor Blumenthal and Il Chung Kim, dean of International Programs and Education at Dongguk University, sign an academic cooperation agreement at UCSC February 14.

Blumenthal said he was pleased to help Dongguk develop international connections adding that international partnerships is also a priority for UCSC.</p><p>Dongguk has cooperative agreements with UCLA, Michigan State, Northern State, State University of New York (Stony Brook) and several other universities in the United States and is also affiliated universities in many countries, including 14 in Japan; 19 in China; 2 in Russia; and one in India, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan. </p><p>The agreement with UCSC follows a program begun last year in which Dongguk sent 11 students to study English in UNEX's 2007 Summer Intensive Program. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91554cd58072704601a012ffa8f53e7a"><name>1962</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.&#13;

The theme of the conference is "Violence in Italian History and Culture."</p>
<p>A professor of international journalism at Columbia University, Stille has also contributed numerous essays to the <em>Boston Globe</em>, <em>The New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. His five books include <em>Excellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic</em> (1995), <em>The Future of the Past</em> (2002) and <em>Benevolence and Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism</em>, which was selected by the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> as one of the best books of 1992 and received the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> book award in the category of history.</p>
<p>Cowell College provost and professor of literature Deanna Shemek--the principal organizer of the conference--explained why the topic of violence was selected as the focal point for the event.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, Italy is thought of as a place of good living and beautiful art, but there is also a great deal of violence in its history," said Shemek. "Italy has also contributed significantly to historical theories of violence with such works as Machiavelli's <em>The Art of War</em> and <em>The Prince</em>, which deal with the logic of violence. And following Mussolini's fascism in World War II, the terrorism of the Red Brigade attacks in the 1970s, and the recent aggression against immigrants, there have been new attempts in Italy to understand violence."</p>
<p>"Major questions about violence still persist in Italy, as they do in the United States," Shemek added. "Are there historic moments of impasse when communication breaks down and violence appears reasonable? And how can political discourse prevent outbreaks of violence as a last resort, for example, in response to racial injustice or environmental travesties?"</p>
<p>Shemek noted that the papers presented at the conference will extend from medieval to contemporary topics, ranging from domestic violence in the 14th century, to the coverage of racial violence in the popular press, to the violent entertainment of Italian slasher films.</p>
<p>"The question of how violence operates in a free society is extremely timely," she added. "We think Stille's historical, sweeping analysis of the Italian case will be of interest to the broader community regarding issues we all see in our lives today--but looked at from the perspective of another country that many Americans love."</p>
<p>Stille's keynote address-co-sponsored by Cowell College and the Department of History--will take place on Friday, February 29, beginning at 5:30 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center. The conference continues on Saturday, March 1, from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the University Center Alumni Room and will be followed by a reception. All events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The California Interdisciplinary Consortium for Italian Studies was established in 2001 to bring together faculty, students, and independent scholars from around the state to present and discuss research across all the disciplines of Italian studies.</p>

<hr/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Max M. Levin: March 29, 1916-February 16, 2008</p>
<p>Max M. Levin, Senior Lecturer and Senior Preceptor at UC Santa Cruz's Crown College from 1967-1982, died on Saturday in Portland, Oregon, at the age of 91 after a prolonged illness. Max is survived by his children Dr. Richard Levin, a physician in San Diego, and Deborah Alastra an artist in Portland, Oregon; grandchildren Naomi Andrews and Joshua Andrews, Daniel Levin and Sammy Levin, and Anita Alastra and Jacob Alastra; great grand daughter, Maya Levin; and by his wife Gloria Weiss Levin. Max was the eldest child of David Levin and Rose Vinitsky, both immigrants from Russian Poland.</p>
<p>Born Menachem Mendel Levin in Chicago in 1916, Max and his family, which included younger sisters Ida and Sarah, moved to the Boyle Heights district of Los Angeles in the early 1920s where his father worked in the construction trades. In 1928 Max traveled alone cross-country to New York to attend yeshiva, ultimately spending the turbulent beginnings of the Great Depression in NYC. While there Max turned away from the religious path laid out for him by family expectation during his days at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (now part of Yeshiva University), focusing his interests on questions of sociology, anthropology, and psychology, as well as progressive politics.</p>
<p>In 1932 Max returned to Los Angeles to attend the University of California. While an undergraduate there, Max met his future wife Dorothy Gillman, originally from Canada, and also a resident of Boyle Heights. Max and Dorothy married in 1937 and moved to Berkeley, he to attend graduate school and she to finish her Bachelor's degree. Max's early ambition was to study anthropology on the East Coast, but this intention was ultimately thwarted by Jewish university quotas, and he entered a PhD program at UC Berkeley in experimental psychology. While there he worked with Edward Tolman, one of the pioneers in behavioral psychology. During the war, Max and Dorothy's oldest children, Claudia, then two years later Richard, were born, and fourteen years later their daughter Deborah was born. Max served in the Public Health Service during World War II and also in a social service position at the now defunct Homewood Terrace Orphanage, which served Jewish orphans. Over the course of his career, Max held a number of faculty positions at universities and research institutions in diverse parts of the country, including the University of Washington, Pullman; University of Wyoming, Laramie; the Foundation Fund for Research in Psychiatry at Yale where he worked with well known psychiatrist, Fritz Redlich; the National Institutes of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland; and Stanford University, where he ran the Institute for Alcohol Studies 1961-1967.</p>
<p>In 1966, at the founding of the University of California, Santa Cruz as the undergraduate campus of the UC, Max joined the pioneering faculty, serving for a time as the Senior Preceptor at Crown College and as a member of the Department of Psychology, where he developed and taught a long running course, Youth and Young Adulthood, until his retirement in 1982. Max was widowed by Dorothy's 1983 death to cancer, and he remarried Gloria Weiss of New York City in 1986. Max's eldest child Claudia, mother of Naomi and Joshua, and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in San Diego, died in 2002. Max remained a resident of Santa Cruz until the end of his life, maintaining close relationships with his remaining children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Max's aptitude for higher education went well beyond academic pursuits; he was eternally interested in and supportive of young people on the cusp of adulthood, helping them find independence, direction, and meaning in their lives. He will be missed by young and old alike. Services will be held on Friday, February 22 at 11am at Beit Shalom Cemetery on Meder Street in Santa Cruz.</p>

The findings are based on annual written surveys and five in-depth in-person interviews conducted with participants.</p><p>During their first quarter at UCSC, about two-thirds of study participants made the transition to college relatively seamlessly, but one-third experienced feelings of isolation and self-doubt, said Azmitia. The majority of those students were able to "find their niche" by spring, but about 40 students of the original 175 did not return for their sophomore year. </p><p>Some students left to study at a different campus, to pursue a major not offered here, or because of financial difficulties, said Azmitia, whose research focuses on adolescent life transitions, while others struggled with homesickness and feeling like "they didn't fit in." </p><p>"They think they can't make friends. They don't know how to 'do' college," said Azmitia. "We tend to think students leave because they aren't doing well academically, but it turns out that grades predict very little. For students, finding a niche turns out to be very important."</p><p>About three-quarters of the students interviewed came from groups that are typically underrepresented in the UC system (African American, Latino/Chicano, Filipino, Native American, and low-income white students who are the first in their family to go to college).</p><p>Over the course of their first year, most students found friends and made connections with key individuals--often residential assistants in dorms, college advisers, and supportive staff members, said Azmitia. "The colleges and staff at this university are amazing," she said. "They seek them out and get them services, support, and the appointments they need."</p><p>On campus, several service providers have modified their programs in response to the study's findings, including the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), Learning Support Services, the Academic Resources Collaborative (ARC), and the colleges. The fall EOP orientation, which used to be optional, is now mandatory, and students are required to meet with their EOP advisers during their first year. Support services now accommodate the schedules of working students and are promoted during winter quarter, as well as fall quarter. Finally, college and department advisers work more closely with ARC to make sure students don't fall through the cracks, and they consult when necessary with parents.</p><p>"We learned from the surveys that a lot of students weren't aware of academic support services, tutors, and that kind of thing," said Azmitia. "Most students go to fall orientation, but some don't, so the campus is trying to reach them. Many students said they were more ready to take advantage of services during their second quarter."</p><p>The fine-grained data generated by the study are particularly valuable as budget constraints threaten outreach efforts and campuses focus on retaining enrolled students, said Azmitia. The study is described in a chapter entitled "Affirmative Action and Ethnic Minority University Students," that appears in the new book <i>Social Development, Social Inequalities, and Social Justice</i> (New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2008). Azmitia and psychology professor Faye Crosby coauthored the article with graduate student Kristina Schmukler and alumus Joel Gills, both of psychology.</p><p>Although the majority of underrepresented students in the study graduated in four years, Azmitia noted two other trends: Some coped with the financial stress of college by taking heavy course loads and graduating in three years, while "too large a portion" stayed five or six years, jeopardizing their ability to actually finish because many didn't realize they must petition for permission to extend their studies beyond four years. </p><p>Azmitia, who interviewed about two-thirds of the seniors in the study, said the study has sensitized her to the needs of students. She recalled the experiences of an 18-year-old African American man whose father died when he was a child and whose mother hadn't finished high school. </p><p>"He was determined to make it, even though he said he was often the only black student in his classes," said Azmitia. "It has changed my teaching a lot. Students mentioned things that really made me think. To hear their stories and what they're dealing with at 18--poverty, death, illness--it has made me very careful about my own perceptions and stereotypes."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915554838072704601a012ff7a4547cd"><name>1968</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>McHenry Library Is Moving! </title><start-date>1203490800000</start-date><display-name>McHenry Library Is Moving!...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1968</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1968</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338542679</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338542679</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Construction of the addition to McHenry Library is approaching completion, so I am writing to alert you to changes that will occur in McHenry as we prepare to begin the next phase of the project. The plan is that the entire contents of the existing McHenry Library building will be moved into the addition that has been construction on the south side, and the existing building will be closed while it is completely renovated. Much of the work will involve seismic and life-safety upgrades to the building, but the interior space will also be reconfigured and upgraded to provide the infrastructure needed for today's libraries. The renovation phase will take approximately 18 months.</p>
<p>The temporary move into the McHenry addition will bring significant, but temporary, changes. Here are some of the major impacts that may affect you in the next 18 months:</p>
<p>* New temporary front door: Access to the library will be through a temporary entrance on the southwest side of the addition (the Performing Arts side). The north side (the Bookstore side) of the existing building will be fenced off, so people approaching from the north will be routed around the construction site to the southwest entrance. The road on the south side of McHenry that has been closed for 2 years will reopen, and metered parking will again be available closer to the library.</p>
<p>* McHenry will be closed during spring break: In order to carry out the move, McHenry Library will close at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 21 and will remain closed throughout spring break. Barring a crisis during the move, the library will reopen on Monday, March 31, although some areas of the addition may be temporarily closed off if moves are still underway. Some services may not be fully operational since we will still be getting settled.</p>
<p>* Submit reserve lists early, if possible: We will do our best to keep up with processing for McHenry course reserves, but it will help us manage this workflow if faculty submit reserve lists as early as possible. More information will be sent out in the next few days from the Reserves unit.</p>
<p>* Special Collections will have limited availability during the renovation phase: Much of the material housed in Special Collections will be temporarily stored at the UC Northern Regional Library Facility and will not be available for use. A small quantity of higher use materials will be kept on site and will be available. Please plan accordingly.</p>
<p>* Dates for books checked out of McHenry Library have been extended: For anyone who has McHenry books checked out that were to be due during spring break, the borrowing period has been extended. No books will be due during the break.</p>
<p>* ILL materials being held through spring break will be available at the Science &amp; Engineering Library circulation desk.</p>
<p>* McHenry books can be returned to the Science &amp; Engineering Library.</p>
<p>* Join us for tours and a celebration later in April: Once we are settled, we plan to have a small celebration with refreshments and tours in mid-April to give UCSC community members a chance to see the new building. More information will be distributed once the date is set. Come join us then to see our new digs!</p>
<p>The complete McHenry expansion and renovation project will be finished in late 2009 or early 2010. It promises to provide our community with a splendid 21st century library, well worth these temporary inconveniences.</p>

Harvard's resolution brings into practice the principles put forward in a motion passed by the UCSC Academic Senate in 2005.</p>
<p>This form of open access, enabled through the retention of copyrights, is intended to give scholars, backed by their universities, the right to post on the web articles that have been published in existing journals. Last year, discussion of a more detailed resolution failed to implement a <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/openaccesspolicy/">systemwide open access policy</a> for the University of California. The UC administration and senate supported the principle of open access but were uncertain about the implementation of the proposal.</p>
<p>Harvard's resolution is remarkably wide. It gives the president and fellows of Harvard College the right to "make available [faculty members'] scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles." This means that Harvard can establish systems to provide free access to journal papers after they have been accepted or published by an academic journal.</p>
<p>The resolution follows in the wake of a mandate issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH sought to have the recipients of its funding post their scholarly articles online within a specified period after their acceptance by journals. Initially this took the form of a voluntary request, but in a bill adopted on July 19, 2007, Congress upgraded that to a requirement that "all investigators funded by the NIH submit . to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts . to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication."</p>
<p>The goal of this open access movement is to maximize the advancement and application of knowledge by ensuring that scholarly research is widely available at no or minimum cost to the reader. Various business models are being tested or are already well-proven to cover the costs of producing journals and retain the full rigors of peer review and still allow this expanded access to results of research and scholarship.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, adding institutional policies to this evolution is a new development and the full implications of the Harvard and NIH moves are not yet fully apparent. What it means for the future shape of scholarly communication is not clear.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a significant tension between the goals of academics and the practices of commercial journal publishers and of some scholarly society journal publishers. Research suggests that free availability of journal articles does not undermine existing commercial journals. One report concludes that "the evidence there is to hand points to the likelihood that the peaceful--and perhaps mutually beneficial--co-existence of traditional journals and open-access archives is entirely possible; in biological terms, mutualism, rather than parasitism or symbiosis, might best describe the relationship." Commercial journal publishers do not accept this research finding. And it is certainly the case that the continuing rapid rise in the cost of subscriptions to commercial journals online provides significant impetus to the movement for open access.</p>
<p>In 2004, the UCSC senate was the first UC campus to pass a resolution threatening to cut ties with Elsevier journals when Elsevier was intransigent in its demand, in negotiations with the UC Administration, for rapidly rising prices. Partly as a result of that resolution, the University of California won that battle. Elsevier returned to the negotiations with greater flexibility, and the price for UC systemwide 10-year access to Elsevier journals was reduced by several million dollars.</p>
<p>Harvard's resolution is a significant step forward in the battle for open access. It further opens the path to wider access to the findings of academic research. UC faculty can back this highly desirable goal by retaining sufficient copyrights so that they can post their articles to public repositories like the UC eScholarship Repository and PubMed Central. Increasingly commercial and scholarly journals allow such posting, sometimes with a delay of a few months after publication.

Although faculty are expected to donate the most books, students are welcome to donate books, too. All EOP students will be eligible to receive books.</p><p>Books may be dropped off during regular business hours at the EOP Office on the first floor of the Academic Resources Center. Books can also be sent by intercampus mail to EOP Book Drive, 121 ARC Center.</p><p>With textbooks ranging in cost from $20 to more than $100, many students are unable to afford books each quarter, said Vang. Although professors typically put required textbooks on reserve at campus libraries, demand often exceeds supply. "There are only one or two copies for lectures with 40 to 100 students," he said.</p><p>With approximately 3,000 EOP students on campus, the need for textbooks is widespread, according to Yolanda Venegas, EOP pregraduate programs counselor. "It doesn't matter if a textbook is old or out of print--if a professor is going to use it in a class, we want it," said Venegas. "If it's going to be used, that's the key."</p><p>For more information, call (831) 459-3048 or contact Vang at lvang@ucsc.edu.  </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91555adc8072704601a012ff39a596cb"><name>1972</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Why does popcorn cost so much at the movies?</title><summary>Movie theaters are notorious for charging consumers top dollar for concession items such as popcorn, soda, and candy.

Are moviegoers just being gouged?</p><p>New research from Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz, suggests that there is a method to theaters' madness--and one that in fact benefits the viewing public. By charging high prices on concessions, exhibition houses are able to keep ticket prices lower, which allows more people to enjoy the silver-screen experience.</p><p>The findings empirically answer the age-old question of whether it's better to charge more for a primary product (in this case, the movie ticket) or a secondary product (the popcorn). Putting the premium on the "frill" items, it turns out, indeed opens up the possibility for price-sensitive people to see films. That means more customers coming to theaters in general, and a nice profit from those who are willing to fork it over for the Gummy Bears.</p><p>Indeed, movie exhibition houses rely on concession sales to keep their businesses viable. Although concessions account for only about 20 percent of gross revenues, they represent some 40 percent of theaters' profits. That's because while ticket revenues must be shared with movie distributors, 100 percent of concessions go straight into an exhibitor's coffers.</p><p>Looking at detailed revenue data for a chain of movie theaters in Spain, Wesley Hartmann, associate professor of marketing at the Graduate School of Business, and Ricard Gil, assistant professor in economics at University of California, Santa Cruz, proved that pricing concessions on the high side in relation to admission tickets makes sense.</p><p>They compared concession purchases in weeks with low and high movie attendance.</p><p>The fact that concession sales were proportionately higher during low-attendance periods suggested the presence of "die-hard" moviegoers willing to see any kind of film, good or bad--and willing to purchase high-priced popcorn to boot. "The logic is that if they're willing to pay, say, $10 for a bad movie, they would be willing to pay even more for a good movie," said Hartmann. "This is underscored by the fact that they do pay more, even for a bad movie, as is seen in their concession buying. So for the times they're in the theater seeing good or popular movies, they're actually getting more quality than they would have needed to show up. That means that, essentially, you could have charged them a higher price for the ticket."</p><p>Should theaters flirt with raising their ticket prices then? No, says Hartmann. The die-hard group does not represent the average movie viewer. While the film-o-philes might be willing to pay, say, $15 for a movie ticket, a theater that tried such a pricing tactic would soon find itself closing its doors.</p><p>"The fact that the people who show up only for good or popular movies consume a lot less popcorn means that the total they pay is substantially less than that of people who will come to see anything. If you want to bring more consumers into the market, you need to keep ticket prices lower to attract them." Theaters wisely make up the margin, he says, by transferring it to the person willing to buy the $5 popcorn bucket.</p><p>The work of Hartmann and Gil substantiates what movie exhibitors have intuited all along. "The argument that pricing secondary goods higher than primary goods can benefit consumers has been circulating for decades, but until now, no one has looked at hard data to see whether it's true or not," says Hartmann.</p><p>In another study examining Spanish theaters, the researchers discovered: Moviegoers who purchase their tickets over the Internet also tend to buy more concession items than those who purchase them at the door, by phone, at kiosks, or at ATMs (the latter option has not yet hit the United States). More research is needed to figure out why, but for now this suggests that theaters may want to be sure to partner with an Internet service to make such ticketing available--or even take the function in-house.</p><p>People who come to the movies in groups also tend to buy more popcorn, soda, and candy, Hartmann and Gil found. While this, too, merits more investigation, it may be that such groups comprise families or teenagers. "If that turns out to be the case, it may be that theaters will want to run more family- or adolescent-oriented movies to attract a more concession-buying crowd," Hartmann says.</p><p>Analyzing data along the lines suggested by Hartmann and Gil can also support other pricing schemes for businesses that sell concessions, such as baseball parks. Taking the kids to a ball game can be a pricey proposition for many families, once you take into account all the hotdogs and memorabilia. "If we found the current pricing scheme turns away such a group, theory suggests that the firm might want to throw in a free baseball cap or bat," Hartmann says. "That raises the quality of the experience and provides an incentive for families to show up."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91555c688072704601a012ff0495ca10"><name>1974</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Memorial for College Eight Student, Michael C.

<p>Stephen Gliessman, Alfred E. Heller Professor of Agroecology, will receive the Distinguished Teaching Award; Bob Hastings, director of Current Students in the Division of Graduate Studies, is the winner of the Outstanding Staff Award.</p>
<p>Gliessman and Hastings, who are to receive $500 each, will be honored at the All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon, taking place on Saturday, April 26, from noon-1:30 p.m., in the College Nine and College Ten Multipurpose Room. The event is part of Reunion Weekend, where hundreds of alumni and guests will gather to reconnect with friends, classmates, and faculty.</p>
<p>Gliessman teaches a range of courses in environmental studies including the legendary 15-unit "Natural History Field Quarter," which exposes students to ecosystems throughout California. An avid sponsor of internships and senior theses, he launched the Program in Community and Agriculture (PICA) in 2002, supported by a significant grant from the Alfred Heller Foundation. PICA brings students to live in the lower quarry, where they learn firsthand the principles of sustainable agriculture, through classroom learning as well as community gardens. Gliessman's former students describe him as an inspiring, dedicated, and approachable teacher and mentor.</p>
<p>"Whether sponsoring graduate students from Mexico, placing UCSC undergraduates in international internships, or working beside his students to create a campus garden, [Gliessman] always goes the extra mile in providing unique learning experiences that have a lifelong impact," wrote alumna Martha Brown (Kresge College, '81, biology/sociology) in nominating Gliessman for the award.</p>
<p>Gliessman has taught at UCSC since 1980.</p>
<p>Since arriving at the Graduate Division in 1977, Hastings has helped graduate students navigate administrative aspects of everything from fellowships and health insurance to academic regulations. Faculty appreciate his work on the Graduate Council, which establishes policies affecting the campus's 1,500 graduate students; all appreciate him as a font of accurate information, historical knowledge, and sage advice.</p>
<p>"Bob's knowledge, expertise, experience, institutional memory, and advice, on any subject-graduate program, graduate student, graduate policies and procedures, graduate funding, graduate studies-related-is unparalleled," wrote Pam Lawson, manager and assistant to the chair, Department of Literature, in nominating Hastings. Lawson received the Outstanding Staff Award in 1998.</p>
<p>Nominators also praised Hastings' professionalism and grace under fire, calling his manner "unflappable," his patience "legendary," and his knowledge "encyclopedic."</p>
<p>The Alumni Achievement Award, previously given at the annual Alumni Association luncheon, was awarded to neurosurgeon Gary Heit last year at the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1673">inaugural Founders Day event</a>, held in October. Heit, a 1977 graduate of Oakes College, was chosen for his development of Deep Brain Stimulation, a treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and chronic pain.</p>
<p>The April 26 luncheon and awards presentation is the key event bringing together all alumni at Reunion Weekend. Interested members of the campus community and the public are also welcome to attend. Tickets are $18 each for Alumni Association members and $20 for nonmembers. The RSVP deadline is Friday, April 18; early reservations encouraged because seating is limited. To RSVP for the luncheon or find out more about Reunion Weekend, call (831) 459-2530, (800) 933-SLUG, or go <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">online</a>.</p>

So tiny she would've fit in the palm of his hand, baby Dilia was kept in isolation and wouldn't know her brother's touch for two months.</p><p>Today, Dilia is a happy 9-year-old, with few traces of those trying months, and Martinez credits her with shaping his own life. "Seeing the struggle my sister   went through just to be alive was not just inspiring, but a driving force today," he said. "That's when I decided I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to know what was going on with her."</p><p>A senior at UCSC, Martinez is majoring in health sciences and community studies on his way to earning a M.D. and a master's in public health. </p><p>"For me, medicine and community work together," said Martinez, who just became the first UCSC student selected to participate in the prestigious <a href="http://www.kff.org/minorityhealth/bjscholars/index.cfm">Barbara Jordan Health Policy Scholars Program</a> in Washington, D.C. One of only 15 scholars chosen from 350 applicants, Martinez will spend nine weeks learning about health policy, particularly issues that affect minorities and underserved communities. It is an opportunity tailored to the interests of Martinez, who says medical care, and disparities in access to care, reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the entire society.</p><p>"Medicine is a commodity now, and people don't have access to it. They can't afford it," said Martinez. "To get to the root of the disparities in health care, you have to understand the social science part of it. That's just as important as the science. You can't have one without the other."</p><p>Fortunately, Martinez's parents had health insurance by the time Dilia was born, but Martinez wonders whether environmental factors contributed to the premature births of four of their seven children, one of whom didn't survive, or to the multiple miscarriages his mother suffered. His need to know fuels his educational drive today, but it hasn't always been that way, according to Martinez.</p><p>A native of East Los Angeles, a predominantly Latino city six miles east of downtown, Martinez grew up playing soccer, baseball, and basketball, but school wasn't a priority. </p><p>"I was doing horribly in school," he recalled. "I barely got through second through sixth grade." His parents, who had immigrated to the United States from Mexico as children, had never attended college, and they wanted more for their children. They chose an unusual avenue for Martinez: They sent him to the city pool to play water polo. Martinez grins as he tells the story, acknowledging the incongruity of a kid from East L.A. embracing a sport associated with tony suburbs and prep schools.</p><p>"It went from a hobby to being my life--I stopped going out with friends because I was always at the pool. It's where I learned discipline, teamwork, and working with other people," he said. "It pulled me away from the street environment I could've fallen into. I found another way to release my energy." </p><p>Martinez liked the intensity of water polo, which challenged his physical capabilities, and it also opened new doors. He enrolled at Cathedral High School in downtown Los Angeles, one of the few schools that offered the sport, and he joined an elite club team, the Commerce Aquatics, that competed nationally. "I went to Hawaii twice and to Florida," recalled Martinez. </p><p>Competing on all-Latino teams in the white-dominated sport also exposed Martinez to racism for the first time. "It ticked people off to lose to a team like ours," he said.</p><p>At UCSC, Martinez was the only nonwhite player on the water polo team, but playing college water polo "was a dream," he said. The Slugs won the Division Three national championship during his third year, and last fall, he wrapped up his fourth and final year with the team.</p><p>"I had the largest culture shock when I came to this city," recalled Martinez, who said the campus looked to him like a farm. He missed his family, his neighborhood, and he missed speaking Spanish. </p><p>Martinez enrolled in pre-med classes but found his footing through friends and by taking classes in Latin American and Latino studies, getting involved with Chicano Teatro, Chicanos/Latinos for Health Education (CHE), and MEChA, the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan, the Chicano student organization. </p><p>Community studies classes rounded out his academic program, and faculty mentors reinforced his commitment to serving others. "The thing that drives me the most is my family," he said. "I'm not just doing this for myself. I'm doing it for people back home. If I can do it, anybody else can, too."</p><p>Martinez will complete his spring-quarter classes from Washington, D.C., because the health policy program begins in mid-May. A demanding program, participants must draft a policy memo and make a public presentation as part of the requirements. Scholars reside at Howard University and receive full support, including a $2,000 stipend upon completion.</p><p>Martinez will work in the offices of <a href=" http://solis.house.gov/">Congresswoman Hilda Solis</a>, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Health Task Force. Flashing a broad smile, he said he has made peace with the prospect of wearing a shirt and tie, dress shoes, and tying back his long, curly hair to work in the nation's capital. </p><p>"As students of color, we need to get over the fear that keeps us from doing something and just do it," he said. "Timidness is not an excuse for not participating. We're valuable."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915568058072704601a012ff00339a16"><name>1981</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rats on islands disrupt ecosystems from land to sea, researchers find</title><summary>The ecological impacts of introduced rats on islands extend far beyond seabird nesting colonies, according to a new UCSC study that provides support for efforts to eradicate rats from the Aleutian Islands.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>rats, island conservation, Donald Croll</keywords><description>The ecological impacts of introduced rats on islands extend far beyond seabird nesting colonies, according to a new UCSC study that provides support for efforts to eradicate rats from the Aleutian Islands.</description><start-date>1203922800000</start-date><display-name>Rats on islands disrupt...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1981</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1981</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338547665</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612480629594</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/ck_w_rat_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/ck_w_rat_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ck_w_rat_250.jpg</name><file-size>69993</file-size><width>250</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Graduate student Carolyn Kurle holds one of the many rats of Rat Island.

But the ecological impacts of rats on islands extend far beyond seabird nesting colonies, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The study, published the week of February 25, 2008, in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, has already helped make the case for the first major rat eradication effort in the Aleutian Islands. Planned to begin this summer, the project will target rats on the appropriately named Rat Island.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers found that the presence of rats on islands in the Aleutian Archipelago dramatically alters the intertidal zone, reducing the amount of seaweed and increasing the numbers of snails, barnacles, and other invertebrates. These changes result from the decimation of seabird populations by the rats, according to graduate student Carolyn Kurle, who led the study.</p>
<p>"When you're on an island with rats, there are so few birds it's silent, in contrast to the cacophony on the islands without rats," Kurle said.</p>
<p>Some of the affected birds--sea gulls and oystercatchers, in particular--are major predators of invertebrates in the intertidal zone. In their absence, the snails, limpets, and other grazers increase in abundance, eat more algae, and clear more space for other invertebrates to settle and grow. The result is a shoreline practically stripped bare of the usual cover of fleshy algae (i.e., seaweed).</p>
<p>"Where there are no rats, we found plenty of birds, fewer invertebrates, and a lot more algal cover," Kurle said.</p>
<p>Kurle's coauthors are associate professor Donald Croll and assistant adjunct professor Bernie Tershy of UCSC's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Croll and Tershy are also the cofounders of Island Conservation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection and restoration of island ecosystems. For the Aleutian Island rat eradication project, Island Conservation has teamed up with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>"Our research is giving us a better understanding of the impacts of introduced rats, and by working directly with government agencies and nongovernmental organizations we're able to do something about it," Croll said.</p>
<p>The study describes an elegant example of an ecological phenomenon known as a trophic cascade. "In a trophic cascade, you have an apex predator--in this case, the rat--and because of what that predator eats, you get a cascade of effects that go down through lower levels of the food chain," Kurle said. "This is a clear example of a trophic cascade that crosses between terrestrial and marine ecosystems."</p>
<p>Kurle spent three summers conducting intertidal surveys on 32 islands in the Aleutian Archipelago--17 with rats and 15 without. At first, camping on rat-infested islands was disconcerting, she said. She had to wear ear plugs the first few nights because the sound of rats rustling around outside the tent was keeping her awake. But she soon got used to it.</p>
<p>"We had to be careful with food and trash, but they never got into the tent or anything," Kurle said. "They come out as soon as it starts to get dark, and we would see them running around everywhere. We spent several nights watching them through night-vision binoculars."</p>
<p>The researchers found large numbers of dead birds partially eaten by rats on the islands. The rats mainly attack the chicks, but may also go after adults, Kurle said. Very few birds manage to breed successfully on the rat-infested islands.</p>
<p>Another recent paper from Croll and Tershy's group provides a global overview of the direct effects of invasive rats on seabirds. Published in the February issue of <i>Conservation Biology</i>, the paper reviews the findings of 94 published studies. First author Holly Jones was an intern with Island Conservation as an undergraduate at UCSC and is now a graduate student at Yale University. Coauthors include Croll, Tershy, and Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC.</p>
<p>"This is a large-scale analysis showing that rats have preyed on 75 species of seabirds in 10 families on islands throughout the world. The hardest hit seabirds are the small, hole-nesting species like petrels and auklets," Croll said.</p>
<p>The good news is that rats can be eradicated from islands. Island Conservation has led successful eradication efforts on islands off the coast of Mexico and on Anacapa Island, one of the Channel Islands off southern California, Croll said. Worldwide, rats have been removed from more than 274 islands, according to the Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>"It's been done many times," Croll said. "What's interesting is the synergy between the research and the conservation efforts. Academic researchers tend to do studies and publish them, and then nothing happens. So it's very exciting for our students to see that their research can tie in directly with the conservation mission of a large organization like the Nature Conservancy."</p>
<p>The Aleutian Islands are part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Kurle's research was supported in part by grants from USFWS and the National Science Foundation and by an EPA STAR Fellowship.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915569988072704601a012ff6811d517"><name>1982</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor condemns attack on researcher</title><start-date>1203922800000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor condemns attack on...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1982</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1982</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338548042</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338548042</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>One of our faculty members, whose research addresses human disease, was the target Sunday afternoon of a very disturbing incident at the researcher's residence in the city of Santa Cruz.

The work they do is critically important, improving our understanding of the causes and treatment of these and other diseases. Any research that involves animals is regulated by federal and state laws, and monitored by a committee comprising faculty, staff, and citizens from the Santa Cruz community.</p><p>Disagreement, debate, and dissent on a range of subjects are all hallmarks of a healthy university community. However, an attempted home invasion by masked perpetrators is not free speech--it is a criminal act that threatens, intimidates, and stifles academic freedom.</p><p>For more than four decades, our faculty, students, and staff have been free to engage in scholarly research that has spanned the sciences, humanities, and arts. Attacks on this cherished freedom, such as the one that occurred on Sunday, should be chilling to each and every one of us.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC  Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91556b538072704601a012ff9cf72036"><name>1983</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposed Revisions to UC Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policies</title><start-date>1204009200000</start-date><display-name>Proposed Revisions to UC...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1983</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1983</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338548506</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338548506</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University is proposing to revise the following nondiscrimination and affirmative action policies:</p><p>* UC Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy Regarding Academic and Staff Employees</p><p>* Affirmative Action Policy Statement for UC Publications Regarding</p><p>Employment Practices</p><p>* Personnel Policies for Staff Members 12, Nondiscrimination in Employment</p><p>* Personnel Policies for Staff Members 14, Affirmative Action</p><p>* Academic Personnel Policy 035, Affirmative Action and Nondiscrimination in Employment</p><p>The proposed revisions pertaining to nondiscrimination would:</p><p>* Expand the "covered veterans" protected category to include all veterans with "service in the uniformed services".

<p>Based on the first four weeks of the college recycling contest, UCSC has tossed out some solid figures.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Per Capita Classic competition, UCSC is 54th out of 167 nationwide, third out of 11 in California (after Stanford University and Mills College).<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>In the Gorilla Prize competition, UCSC is 32nd out of 188 nationwide, second out of 12 in California (after Stanford). <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>In the Targeted Material--Corrugated Cardboard subcategory, UCSC is 31st out of 145 nationwide, second out of 10 in California (again after Stanford).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"I think we're doing pretty well," said UCSC Recycling Coordinator Dave Wade, though he noted, "There are a few schools in each category that seem to be in a whole other league."</p>
<p>His goals for UCSC's starting year in the competition are modest, he said.</p>
<p>"First, to throw our hat into the ring and establish our presence nationally, and secondly to lay a base on this campus for competing more seriously next year," said Wade.</p>
<p>ReycleMania is an annual friendly competition among college and university recycling programs across the country.</p>
<p>More than 400 schools are participating in the 2008 competition, vying to see who can motivate their campus communities to recycle more and reduce overall waste over a 10-week period.</p>
<p>During the competition, campuses go head-to-head in different contests to see which institution can collect the largest amount of recyclables per capita, the largest amount of total recyclables, the least amount of trash per capita, or have the highest recycling rate. The contest began Jan. 27.</p>
<p>Results are reported weekly on Fridays on the RecycleMania <a href="http://recyclemania.org">web site</a>.</p>

The Big Creek Reserve is located in the Santa Lucia Mountains on the Big Sur coast.</p>
<p>Dayton replaces Maggie Fusari who retired in October after more than 26 years of service to the NRS and the Environmental Studies Department. Readdie has taken over for Kurt Merg who resigned last September.</p>
<p>Dayton and Readdie will work in collaboration with Don Croll, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and faculty director of the Natural Reserve System.</p>
<p>Dayton began his appointment in mid-January and is responsible for program development, administration, outreach, grant writing, and fundraising for the reserves administered by UCSC. He has a B.S. in wildlife management from Humboldt State University and a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Texas A&amp;M University. In addition to project and grant management experience, Dayton has conducted research and taught undergraduate and graduate courses in the classroom and in the field.</p>
<p>Readdie has served as the interim director at Big Creek for the past six months with responsibility for program development, administration, and management of conservation programs and has began work on a major funding proposal to significantly enhance the infrastructure and usability of the reserve. He graduated from UC Santa Cruz with B.A. and Ph.D. degrees in biology. Readdie has conducted intertidal and subtidal research in a variety of settings, provided research training, and is an expert diver.</p>
<p>The University of California Natural Reserve System is a unique assemblage of 36 protected wildland sites throughout California.

Now, as director of the malaria program at the Institute for OneWorld Health, Grove is involved in a unique public health project that is applying the tools of the biotechnology industry to the battle against one of the most devastating diseases in the developing world.</p><p>After graduating from UCSC (Oakes College) in 1979 with a degree in biology, Grove went on to earn master's degrees in public health and medical microbiology at UC Berkeley. Recently, she returned to UCSC to talk to students in Phillip Berman's "Biotechnology and Drug Development" class about her career and her current work at OneWorld Health, a nonprofit pharmaceutical company that develops drugs for people with infectious diseases in the developing world.</p><p>"She has one of the broadest backgrounds in biotechnology of anyone I know," said Berman, who chairs the Department of Biomolecular Engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. "The students had expressed an interest in OneWorld Health, and I thought it would be interesting for them to meet someone who has had a terrifically interesting career in all areas of biotechnology, from research to management."</p><p>In her talk to Berman's class, Grove explained the "10/90 gap" that sums up the problem of neglected diseases: Only 10 percent of global health-related research and development funding is devoted to conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden. </p><p>Malaria ranks third among the top neglected diseases in terms of the number of people affected. Every year, malaria causes between 300 and 500 million acute infections, and more than one million people (mostly children) die of the disease. At OneWorld Health, Grove manages a project that aims to ensure an adequate and affordable supply of what has emerged as the best available therapy for malaria. </p><p>The World Health Organization's recommended treatment for malaria is called artemesinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Artemesinin is an antimalarial drug derived from the wormwood plant (<i>Artemesia annua</i>). It is highly effective, and combining it with other drugs makes it harder for the malaria parasite to evolve resistance to artemesinin. "Resistance of the malaria parasite to commonly used drugs is a worsening problem," Grove explained. </p><p>But producing artemesinin requires cultivation, harvesting, and extraction processes that are time-consuming and labor-intensive. With funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OneWorld Health has teamed up with UC Berkeley and Amyris Biotechnologies to develop a new, low-cost method to produce semisynthetic artemesinin using techniques originated by UC Berkeley chemical engineer Jay Keasling.</p><p>"This project is using the tools of synthetic biology to take a natural plant product and create a more consistent and reliable supply," Grove said. "Currently, the entire supply depends on the crops grown by farmers. We need an additional low-cost, nonseasonal source of high-quality artemesinin to meet the anticipated demand for ACTs for people in developing countries."</p><p>The project has much in common with Grove's previous work at the biotechnology company Genentech, where she spent 20 years in a variety of positions. Among other things, she worked with Berman on Genentech's AIDS vaccine project. In her most recent position as director of commercial regulatory affairs, she was responsible for the product launches of four new drugs for asthma, cancer, and psoriasis.</p><p>When she left Genentech, Grove was planning to take some time off. But then she learned about the Insitute for OneWorld Health and met its founder, Victoria Hale. In 2007, she was named vice president of commercial planning and director of the malaria program.</p><p>"The opportunity to apply my drug development skills to diseases of the developing world was very attractive to me," Grove said. "It's a new business model for drug development that relies on grant-based funding and removes the profit element in order to focus on the public health benefits."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915578bd8072704601a012ffccc8ef00"><name>1992</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor pledges support for researcher at staff forum</title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal opened his remarks at the winter-quarter taff Brown Bag Open Forum by addressing the Feb. 24 confrontation at the Westside home of a UCSC researcher.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Staff Brown Bag Open Forum, Blumenthal, researcher, biomedical research</keywords><description>Chancellor George Blumenthal opened his remarks at the winter-quarter taff Brown Bag Open Forum by addressing the Feb. 24 confrontation at the Westside home of a UCSC researcher.</description><start-date>1204182000000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor pledges support for...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1992</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1992</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338551940</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338551940</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/blumenthal.winter.brown.bag.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/blumenthal.winter.brown.bag.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blumenthal.winter.brown.bag.300.jpg</name><file-size>15061</file-size><width>300</width><height>199</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor Blumenthal addresses staff at the winter-quarter Staff Brown Bag Open Forum Feb. 27.

"This is unacceptable. We will not tolerate it."</p><p>The campus will not succumb to intimidation of this sort, said Blumenthal. </p><p>"I salute the people who do research and encourage them to continue their research in the light of these threats," said Blumenthal to applause.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91557a398072704601a012ff8b5c58e9"><name>1993</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Dana Priest wins major journalism award for Walter Reed exposé</title><summary>Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; reporter Dana Priest (B.A. politics, 1981) and her colleague Anne Hull have won the prestigious 2008 Selden Ring award for their exposé of deplorable conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>priest, alumni, journalism, selden</keywords><description>Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; reporter Dana Priest (B.A. politics, 1981) and her colleague Anne Hull have won the prestigious 2008 Selden Ring award for their exposé of deplorable conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</description><start-date>1204268400000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Dana Priest wins...</display-name><path>/2008/02/1993</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/02/1993</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338552322</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338552322</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/02/images/awardk.06_03_13.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/02/images/awardk.06_03_13.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>awardk.06_03_13.jpg</name><file-size>15795</file-size><width>230</width><height>191</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Dana Priest received the Division of Social Sciences' 2006 Distinguished Alumni Award.

<p>Their coverage, which revealed unsanitary conditions and a nightmarish bureaucracy at the hospital, prompted an outcry that generated immediate reforms.</p>
<p>The award is presented annually by the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. The award, which carries a $35,000 prize, recognizes the best of investigative journalism that led to direct results.</p>
<p>In 2006, Priest won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting about the CIA-run secret "black site" prisons and other controversial aspects of the government's counterterrorism program. She visited campus earlier that year to accept the Division of Social Sciences' first <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/04-17/priest.asp">Distinguished Alumni Award</a>.</p>

Summer Orientation represents the first step toward a student's academic and social transition into university life, eventually leading to graduation and becoming a UC Santa Cruz alumnus!</p><p>Mark your calendar now for the Summer 2008 Orientation dates:</p><p>Frosh: July 10 (Thurs.), 12 (Sat.), 15 (Tues.), 17 (Thurs.),and 22 (Tues.)</p><p>Transfer: July 19 (Sat)</p><p>July 24 is set aside as a tentative date for either frosh or transfer students. At this point we anticipate not needing it. However, we want to make sure it is not a surprise to anyone in case we need to have Orientation on this day. We will know by late May or early June.</p><p>On each day of Summer Orientation, we expect to host 1,200 to 1,500 students and their guests, many of whom will be visiting our beautiful campus for the first time. The students come to us very excited and a bit anxious. Our goal is to provide information, direction, and support during this exciting time. And to that end, we will share our resources and services that support student success.</p><p>Orientation is the perfect time for offices/programs/departments/student organizations to provide information to new students in a large forum. For example, college advisers will meet incoming students before they enroll in classes. Department advisers will meet both with students who have chosen a major and with undeclared students, who may need more information.</p><p>In addition, Orientation offers students the opportunity to:</p><p>* enroll in classes</p><p>* get pictures taken for their UCSC ID Card</p><p>* take placement exams, if needed</p><p>* get first-hand knowledge from current UCSC students</p><p>* take campus tours</p><p>* hear about campus resources such as learning support services, safety resources, the Health Center, financial aid, the Ethnic Resource Centers, college and university housing, student groups, career services, and other services</p><p>Rosa M. Plaza, Interim Director of Campus Orientation Programs, is currently working with the Orientation Planning Team coordinating the programs. Should you have any feedback regarding past Orientations or new ideas for future programming, please e-mail her directly at <a href="mailto:rplaza@ucsc.edu">rplaza@ucsc.edu</a> or call her at ext. 9-5499.</p><p>We welcome you to join us in ensuring that future UCSC students and their families and guests have the richest Orientation experience possible.

<p>The chancellor discussed continued efforts toward sustainability on campus, the record number and increased diversity of freshman and transfer applicants to UC Santa Cruz, and the campus's success in receiving stem cell grants.</p>
<p>But the chancellor emphasized that the state budget for 2008-09 represents a significant challenge to the campus. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposed budget for UC is $417 million below the 2008-09 level requested by the Board of Regents, Blumenthal reported.</p>
<p>What that means for UC Santa Cruz remains unclear, he said. No decisions have been made about how to fill the gap, according to the Office of the President.</p>
<p>Questions addressed to the chancellor from staff covered a range of topics, including choices of health care providers and premium amounts for different pay levels, salaries and contracts, child care, and downsizing and a voluntary separation program at the Office of the President.</p>
<p>Questioners also inquired about the potential for freezing merit raises given the budget situation.</p>
<p>To date, there hasn't been talk of freezing or cutting staff salaries, said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"I don't know to what extent salaries will increase next year, but I don't see them going down," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Some members of the AFSCME union asked a number of questions concerning subcontracting, contracts, and salaries, before marching out of the room.</p>
<p>For those unable to attend, the forum will be archived on the Staff Advisory Board <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/events.html">web site</a>.</p>
