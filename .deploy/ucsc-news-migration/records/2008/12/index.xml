Everywhere you look you'll see the careful balance between the natural environment and buildings. </p><p>Of the 2,000 acres on campus, fewer than 600 are developed. There forests and open spaces surround buildings.</p><p>Approximately 15,000 trees are maintained within the core campus area. The care of these trees is managed by the UCSC Grounds Department tree crew, which consists of a board certified master arborist and three trimmers. While forests and grasslands are largely maintained in their natural state, maintenance is performed for safety, including the trimming or thinning of deadwood or precarious trees and mowing of meadow perimeters to alleviate fire risk. </p><p>Top priority areas for maintenance are the campus core and college and housing areas, followed by pathways, parking lots and roads. Careful records are kept of tree removal. Since 1998, grounds crews have removed 134 trees. They planted 175 in the same period. </p><p>For instance, grounds staff removed a rotting madrone at Porter College a year ago, replacing it with three oak trees.  Seven redwoods were planted in the Chinquapin Bowl below College 9 Namaste Lounge. </p><p>Founding Chancellor Dean McHenry decreed in the early development of the campus that no tree larger than 12 inches in diameter could be removed without his approval. That tradition continues today. Any removal of a tree with a trunk 12 inches wide or more requires the explicit approval of a principal officer. </p><p>When trees are removed for maintenance or new facilities, the wood usually remains on campus where it is chipped and used for landscaping and erosion control. Often larger pieces are recycled into benches or other site furnishing amenities. Note the massive benches at College 9 and outside the new Humanities Building. </p><p>Occasionally, innovative restoration efforts are accomplished. Redwood stumps, removed for the construction of the Engineering 2 building, were "replanted" along Spring Road, just north of Colleges 9 and 10. Today, new saplings have sprouted and are thriving, continuing the cycle of life and helping erosion control efforts along the fire road.</p><p>Fallen trees or those removed for safety or construction are sometimes used in other locations for stream-bank restoration or fish habitat. In a cooperative effort with the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, California Department of Fish and Game, and Big Creek Lumber, 40-foot redwood logs with root balls still attached were trucked to the banks of the Carmel River to be used in a habitat restoration project. </p><p>The trees were placed along 400 feet of the riverbank to create fish habitat for sensitive aquatic species such as steelhead, California red-legged frogs and western pond turtles. In 2005, more redwoods were donated to the restoration project. </p><p>Careful and deliberate stewardship of the magnificent UC Santa Cruz campus for more than four decades has ensured that the natural environment is maintained alongside world-class facilities for teaching and research. </p><p></p><p>More information on UCSC's tradition of stewardship may be found at </p><p><a href="http://ucscplant.ucsc.edu/ucscplant/Grounds/index.jsp?page=Stewardship_Program">http://ucscplant.ucsc.edu/ucscplant/Grounds/index.jsp?page=Stewardship_Program</a></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158df038072704601a012ff07899dc4"><name>2585</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC receives $150,000 grant for Jewish Studies program</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded a $150,000 grant from the David B.

Gold Foundation to support a new project in the campus's Jewish Studies Program. </p><p>Titled "Crossing Boundaries and Building Bridges," the project will integrate contemporary issues that are most important to students, faculty, and the community-including the environment, science and technology, the arts, women's issues, and race relations-with a range of perspectives and methods unique to Jewish Studies. </p><p>The new project will include:</p><p>.  An ongoing series of lectures and readings by prominent scholars and writers on such topics as "Jewish Women Writers," "Jews in Muslim Lands," and "Jewish Mysticism."</p><p>. An annual interdisciplinary conference that will redefine the boundaries of Jewish Studies and cross over into many different fields.</p><p>. An annual moderated dialogue between a UCSC Jewish Studies scholar and a renowned scholar from another field. </p><p></p><p>The first moderated dialogue is scheduled to take place in February 2009 between Professor Sudhir Venkatest of Columbia University-a sociologist featured in the acclaimed book <i>Freakonomics</i>, who is one of the nation's premier experts on inner-city poverty-and UCSC professor of history and literature Nathaniel Deutsch. </p><p>Titled "Shtetl and Ghetto," the event will contrast the Eastern European Jewish shtetl and the African American ghetto. </p><p>The first annual conference will take place in April 2009 and is titled "Jewish Studies at Santa Cruz: On the Cutting Edge of Tradition." The 2010 conference will focus on "Judaism and the Environment," and the topic for 2011 will be "Judaism and the Internet."</p><p>UCSC's Professor Deutsch is planning to publish a book with the University of California Press titled <i>Virtual Religion: How the Internet is Transforming the Way We Worship God, Build Community, and Perform Ritual</i> in conjunction with the "Judaism and the Internet" conference.</p><p>"With the generous support of the David B. Gold Foundation, UCSC's Jewish Studies program will be embarking on a series of exciting and important interdisciplinary dialogues, lectures, and conferences that will enrich both the campus and the wider Santa Cruz community," Deutsch noted. </p><p>"The commitment of the Gold Foundation will help UCSC to shape a distinctly Santa Cruz approach to Jewish studies, one that is both anchored in tradition, and cutting edge in sensibility."</p><p></p><p>							</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158e0668072704601a012ffe3ac2cc7"><name>2586</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recent retirements</title><summary>Staff and faculty who retired May-October 2008</summary><keywords>Retirements</keywords><description>Staff and faculty who retired May-October 2008</description><start-date>1228114800000</start-date><display-name>Recent retirements...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2586</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2586</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338775089</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1334006407266</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Retirements</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The following staff and faculty members retired during the period of May through October 2008.

A team led by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, Santa Cruz, has developed a compact prototype detector that uses magnetic nanotechnology to spot cancer-associated proteins in a human blood serum sample with much higher sensitivity than current detectors.</p>
<p>The researchers describe their results in a paper published in an upcoming issue of <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to its high sensitivity, the new detector can monitor multiple biomarkers simultaneously. This "multiplex" capability is important because the use of multiple biomarkers is likely to provide greater accuracy and reliability than single biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and other potential applications, said Nader Pourmand, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p>
<p>"With current detectors, you can only detect one protein at a time," Pourmand said. "Instead of the standard fluorescent tags, we used nanosized magnetic beads as tags and were able to detect target molecules with tens to hundreds of times greater sensitivity than standard techniques."</p>
<p>"This is essentially a proof-of-concept study showing that now we have a chip and a reader that can find multiple biomarkers in a sample at a concentration much lower than the standard that is commercially available," said Shan Wang, a Stanford professor of materials science and engineering and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>Wang and Pourmand are senior authors of the paper, along with Stanford biochemistry and genetics Professor Ronald W. Davis.</p>
<p>To tag the cancer proteins with magnetic nanoparticles, the detector subjects blood serum samples to an incubation process that takes place in roughly half an hour. At the heart of the detector is a silicon chip designed by the paper's first author, Sebastian Osterfeld, a Stanford materials science and engineering doctoral student. The chips have 64 embedded sensors whose electrical resistance changes in the presence of a nearby magnetic field. Attached to these sensors are capture antibodies that have the unique ability to latch on to specific cancer-related proteins as they float by.</p>
<p>During the incubation process, these antibodies first capture their specific cancer proteins. Next, a second wave of antibodies attach to the specific cancer proteins on one end and magnetic nanoparticles on the other end, tethering the captured cancer biomarkers to magnetic "nanotags." The tags emit a magnetic field that causes a change in the resistance of the underlying sensor, giving the detector a clear signal.</p>
<p>In the <em>PNAS</em> paper, the researchers described detection of very low concentrations of various cancer biomarkers, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and cancer embryonic antigen. In a multiplex assay involving seven potential cancer biomarkers, concentrations ranging from 5 quadrillionths to 0.1 trillionths of a mole (a standard unit of measurement for molecules) were unambiguously detected simultaneously.</p>
<p>The researchers also estimated that they could detect levels of the protein human chorionic gonadotropin about 400 times lower than the concentration detectable by current commercial kits known by the acronym ELISA, in which captured proteins are conjugated to color-altering or fluorescent labels.</p>
<p>To properly prepare a patient's blood sample for use with the detector, a technician must use a centrifuge to separate out the serum, which contains the biomarkers. For this reason, the device would need to be located in a hospital or a private diagnostic lab, Wang said. Even before that, the device faces clinical utility testing and then must undergo clinical trials to win regulatory approval. To see the device through those steps, Pourmand and Wang have cofounded a startup company, MagArray, in the Panorama Institute for Molecular Medicine, a nonprofit incubator in Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p>Wang said he is optimistic that the technology could someday save lives by detecting cancer early or by helping doctors to select more effective therapy.</p>
<p>"The earlier you can detect a cancer, the better chance you have to kill it," Wang said. "This could be especially helpful for lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer, because those cancers are hidden in the body."</p>
<p>The nascent startup has also begun to apply the technology to diagnosis and assessing risk of heart attack in emergency rooms. Heart cell death is also associated with the release of specific biomarker proteins.</p>
<p>The research was funded partly by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense. Other authors of the paper include Heng Yu, Richard Gaster, Stefano Caramuta, Liang Xu, Shu-Jen Han, Drew Hall, Robert Wilson, and Robert White, all of Stanford, and Shouheng Sun, of Brown University.</p>

chancellor's on-campus photography contest is a dreamy scene of a misty path curving away out of sight into fog-enshrouded redwoods caught by Professor James Clifford of the History of Consciousness Department.</p>
<p>Hopeful photographers sent in more than 250 photos for the annual contest, announced this year in September. But the foggy path photo caught the eye of the judges.</p>
<p>"I loved the serenity of the scene," said judge Kelly Weisberg, Hastings College of the Law professor and Chancellor Blumenthal's wife. "I was also struck by the contrast of the fog and the vibrant fall colors. It made me want to step right into the picture and walk down the path."</p>
<p>Each year, the Chancellor's Office holds a contest for a photograph of the UC Santa Cruz campus, taken by a member of the UCSC community, to use as the front cover of its season's greeting card.</p>
<p>The Chancellor's Office and the Arts Division sponsor the contest, which is open to all UCSC faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p>First prize is a $200 Bay Tree Book Store gift certificate.</p>
<p>Photographers given honorable mentions receive a certificate of acknowledgment. <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2604">See all honorable mention photos.</a></p>

McNulty.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Graduating senior Danielle Soto is cramming, but it's not finals she's worried about. </p><p>Soto is boning up on the Brown Act, the state's "open meeting" law, as she prepares to take a seat on the Pomona City Council.</p><p>Soto will be sworn in two days after her last exam.</p><p>"I'm super stressed out getting this done, but I'm almost done," said Soto, who is taking 18 units this quarter. "It feels like jumping off a cliff."</p><p>The new council's first meeting is December 15. "My calendar is already getting booked up," said Soto, who is being briefed by the city manager on local issues and by the city attorney on the legalities of being an elected official, including the Brown Act. With a population of nearly 150,000, Pomona is the fifth-largest city in Los Angeles County.</p><p>An environmental studies major, Soto decided to run for office when a council seat opened up over the summer. Although the timing wasn't ideal--Soto would have preferred to run after graduation--she knew she had to jump at the opportunity. Politics, she is quick to say, runs in the family.</p><p>Soto's grandfather, Philip Soto, was one of the first Latinos elected to the California Assembly, and her grandmother, Nell, served in both the state Assembly and Senate before retiring this year at the age of 81. She began her political career by winning the District 1 council seat that Soto just won. "It's pretty amazing stuff," said Soto.</p><p>"I've only known my grandmother as a public servant," said Soto, whose earliest memories include campaigning on her grandmother's behalf. "I remember sitting in the council chambers as a kid thinking, 'I want to do that.'" </p><p>Soto is quick to say that she "didn't win purely on my own merits." In a field of four candidates, Soto received more than half of the votes cast in the District 1 race, but she attributes the outcome to respect for her family. </p><p>"This isn't coming out of the blue. I have a pretty good idea what I'm getting into," said Soto. "I'm humbled and appreciative of the confidence people put in me with their votes. This is a very serious undertaking. I have a huge learning curve in front of me, and I'm fully aware of it."</p><p>Soto is eager to bring her passion for the environment to her job, and to tackle </p><p>other issues. "Crime is a persistent challenge, as is bringing in business," she said. "My first priority is to hold a town hall meeting with my constituents to establish a dialogue, whether they voted for me or not."</p><p>Soto would also like to beef up Pomona's neighborhood watch groups--"because the police can't always be there"--and she wants to streamline city processes to make them more "business friendly."</p><p>"The first step in anything, I think, is dialogue," said Soto, whose district includes part of downtown Pomona.</p><p>Soto said her UCSC education helped prepare her for a career in local politics. Classes in state and national environmental policy, as well as courses on water policy, land-use planning, and an internship in environmental interpretation that boosted her public-speaking skills, will come in handy, she said.</p><p>"I'm really proud to be taking my UC education with me," said Soto, who kept her candidacy under wraps as much as possible. "I'm kind of a private person, but I had to tell one instructor, because I had to miss a quiz to attend a community candidates forum," she recalled. "He looked at me like I was crazy." But he did excuse her absence.</p><p>Soto, 22, was one of six candidates under the age of 30 who ran for Pomona City Council. As she prepares to trade her jeans and hoodies for suits and heels, Soto said she feels honored to have been elected on the day the nation elected its first African American president.</p><p>"I saved my sample ballot, because Obama's name is on it, too," she said. "I do feel like I'm part of a historical moment. I'm very proud to be part of that in some small way."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158ede68072704601a012ff1469d23c"><name>2595</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Griggs, Reguerin named Community Heroes for 2008  </title><summary>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute for Marine Sciences, and Pablo Reguerin, deputy director of the Educational Partnership Center, have been named Community Heroes for 2008 by the Community Assessment Project of the United Way of Santa Cruz County.</summary><keywords>griggs, reguerin, heroes, baskin, downes </keywords><description>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute for Marine Sciences, and Pablo Reguerin, deputy director of the Educational Partnership Center, have been named Community Heroes for 2008 by the Community Assessment Project of the United Way of Santa Cruz County.</description><start-date>1228201200000</start-date><display-name>Griggs, Reguerin named Community...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2595</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2595</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338778544</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338778544</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute for Marine Sciences, and Pablo Reguerin, deputy director of the Educational Partnership Center, have been named <a href="http://www.santacruzcountycap.org/heroes.htm">Community Heroes</a> for 2008 by the Community Assessment Project of the United Way of Santa Cruz County. </p><p>Griggs, a professor of Earth and Marine Sciences since 1968, was honored in the Natural Environment category for his 40 years of teaching and research on the California coast.</p><p>Reguerin, EPC's deputy director for the past six years, was honored in the Education category for his community outreach work to increase college-going and transfer rates among underrepresented and educationally disadvantaged students.</p><p>Griggs and Reguerin were among 26 members of the local community selected as heroes for 2008.

<p>The award was given by the San Andreas Regional Center (SARC), a private nonprofit corporation funded by the State of California to serve people with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The award ceremony, called the 11th Annual Service Above Self Awards Dinner, was held in late October. The annual dinner is an opportunity to honor those who have made significant and exemplary contributions in the field of developmental disabilities. More than 600 people attended the event.</p>
<p>Crown/Merrill Dining Hall employs eight staff members from HOPE Services, a local nonprofit that helps people with developmental disabilities so that they can live and participate in their communities. HOPE Services operates under the umbrella of SARC.</p>
<p>The campus HOPE employees are "some of the hardest-working people I've ever worked with," said Daniel Tokar, service manager for Crown/Merrill Dining Hall, who accepted the award at the dinner. "They always have a good attitude, their teamwork is amazing, and they're always putting out a big effort."</p>
<p>Two of the HOPE dining hall employees are non-developmentally disabled people who serve as job coaches; six are HOPE clients receiving job coaching. The nonprofit has had up to seven crews employed at the various UCSC dining halls in the past.</p>
<p>The HOPE Crown/Merrill Dining Hall staff members are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tiffany Perez (10 years)<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Larry Yhap (10 years)<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Aaron Szoke (10 years)<br/>

<br/>
<p>Job coaches:</p>

<li>Bob Flegal<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>District director:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sally French</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>HOPE staff member Aaron Szoke gave a speech at the dinner that left "not a dry eye in the house," said Tokar. The speech was so well received that SARC later flew Szoke to San Diego to give the same speech at another event.</p>
<p>UCSC has employed people in the HOPE work programs for 25 years.</p>
<p>The HOPE staff members are assigned dish room tasks and are critical to the successful functioning of the dining hall. In spite of changeovers and budgetary cuts, UCSC has remained committed to continuing the contract, said HOPE Services' Hagemann. This opportunity translates to a variety of things for each crewmember, such as more financial independence, social opportunities, and skill building, she said.</p>
<p>"They're the true heroes of the dining hall," said Tokar. "Day in and day out, they're working in the dish room. They are very consistent."</p>
<p>Crown/Merrill Dining Hall feeds 1,000-2,000 students a day during the HOPE staffers' shift--7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
<p>"That's a lot of dishes," said Tokar.</p>

Next year, UCSC will host the four-week summer program, along with NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The Lolland California Renewable Energies (LoCal-RE) program is an international collaboration between three UC campuses--Santa Cruz, Davis, and Merced--and Denmark's Roskilde University and Technical University of Denmark. According to program organizer Ali Shakouri, a professor of electrical engineering at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, the focus is on the real-world challenges of implementing renewable energy technologies.</p>
<p>Last summer, UC students joined Danish students in Lolland, Denmark, to study renewable energy resources such as wind, biogas, and hydrogen. They reviewed "big picture" questions about energy availability and the technologies currently used to harvest renewable energies.</p>
<p>But the main focus was on the policies that govern the resources and the problems encountered in implementing renewable energy technologies. For example, wind farm crews told students about problems caused by lightning strikes and the need to change the oil in all the wind turbines every five years. They also described how they dealt with those challenges.</p>

<p>"These are the kinds of things that give us perspective on how difficult it is to implement some of the ideas that on paper seem quite easy," said Shakouri.</p>
<p>Learning from experts in the field was one of the greatest successes of the program, Shakouri said. Instead of just listening to lectures, students observed firsthand the challenges encountered and solutions implemented in real situations. The group spent two weeks of the month-long trip on excursions to large- and small-scale energy projects, including Lolland's Nysted Offshore Wind Farm, which is one of the largest in the world, and the Lolland Community Testing Facilities, an international testing and demonstration platform for renewable energy technologies.</p>
<p>The students collaborated in small groups to write final reports on a real project. "We realized students do much better when they do something in a social context," Shakouri said. "Because the projects were about local problems in California and in Denmark, students were much more interested."</p>
<p>Diverse student backgrounds, from environmental studies to electrical engineering to economics, allowed the groups to examine all angles of a particular energy problem. "It was a great learning experience," said Shakouri.</p>
<p>Next summer at UCSC, Shakouri hopes to increase the number of students to 40, with 20 from the U.S. and 20 from Denmark. Students will visit several renewable energy sites in California, including solar farms, wind farms, and biomass facilities. Program organizers also hope to arrange visits with Santa Cruz city officials and legislators in Sacramento. Student projects will focus on the implementation of renewable energy resources relevant to California and to potential international collaborations.</p>

But to the sea otters, albatrosses, and other animals that call it home, ocean waters delineate habitats and boundaries as clearly as any printed map.</p>
<p>"Marine animals are living in a fluid environment; their habitat is constantly changing. The trick is to understand how they utilize that environment," said Dan Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Costa studies how marine animals ranging from fur seals to dolphins to penguins make a living in the open ocean. By attaching computerized satellite tags to fur, feathers, or blubber, he can track in real time where an animal goes, when and how deep it dives, and the temperature and salinity of surrounding waters. In 2000, Costa cofounded the Tagging of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP) program for top ocean predators such as great white sharks, bluefin tuna, and elephant seals. Once their migratory routes and critical habitats are known, that data can be used for conservation.</p>
<p>Now in its eighth year, TOPP has been funded primarily by the Alfred P. Sloan, Gordon and Betty Moore, and David and Lucile Packard Foundations, as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the California Sea Grant program, the Office of Naval Research, and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program.</p>

"Once we know what types of oceanic properties attract a species, we can start to predict where animals may or may not be," Costa said. "If the Navy's out there making noise, for example, we can tell them to stay away from certain conditions because these species are likely out there." <br/>
<br/>
<p>Costa soon realized he could put tag data to a second, more global use--to learn more about the ocean itself.</p>
<p>"I saw that the tags could tell us about the environment that the animals live in, to help understand the ocean environment for its own sake," he said.</p>
<p>Most oceanographic buoys float passively with the currents, limiting their range. But a swimming animal can sample biologically important waters a buoy could never reach. In 2006, Costa and colleagues reported that their 58 tagged southern elephant seals returned more than 4,500 fall and winter seawater measurements from the Southern Ocean, including many dives beneath Antarctic shelf ice, compared with just 148 from ships and floats.</p>
<p>This recent work is just one of many scientific studies and expeditions Costa has led to the southernmost continent over his 30 years in the marine sciences. Just this year, a coastal landform in Antarctica was named the Costa Spur in honor of his contributions to Antarctic research.</p>
<p>When not headed off to do field work in places such as Hawaii and South Africa, Costa has been known to do some serious cycling. He's already completed three AIDS charity rides and would like to do more.</p>
<p>"I recently got an e-mail from the administration about a course on time management," he said, adding with a laugh, "I'd love to go, but I don't have time to take the course."</p>

Jones</a>, founding president of Green For All, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, and author of <I>The Green Collar Economy,</I> will speak at UC Santa Cruz's 25th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation February 12.</p><p>The title of Jones's speech is "The Green-Collar Economy: Restoring the Earth, Good Jobs, and MLK's Dream."</p><p>Held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the convocation will begin at 7:30 p.m. The event, which is free and open to the public, is part of the campus celebration of Black History Month. </p><p>Campus radio station <a href="http://kzsc.org/">KZSC</a> (88.1 FM) will broadcast the event live and also stream it over its website.  </p><p>The convocation brings the campus and regional communities together to honor the life and work of the American icon who inspired the world to move beyond race to celebrate our common humanity, said Catherine Faris, assistant vice chancellor, University Relations. </p><p>"This year, the convocation will take place in a climate where dramatic change is sweeping the nation," Faris said. "Although we are facing the serious economic consequences of recession, this year's convocation will communicate the spirit of hope for the future."</p><p>This year marks the first presentation of the Tony Hill Award. Hill, a prominent community activist and treasured mentor who died last year, had been involved in planning the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation every year since its start. </p><p>Event organizers will give the award to a nominee who demonstrates the hallmarks of Hill's life: mentor, inspirational leader, gifted mediator, and bridge-builder in the community. The recipient of the award will receive a $500 cash contribution from UC Santa Cruz to the nonprofit of his or her choice. <a href=" http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2534">Nominations</a> are being accepted through January 7. </p><p>Hill "was a dynamo in making the community a better place for all," said Hill's longtime friend, philanthropist George Ow Jr. "He used his life energies doing much heavy lifting and fighting many hard battles--that is why he isn't with us now." </p><p>The award "will acknowledge someone who is now fighting the good fight and keep Tony's name and memory before us," said Ow. </p><p> </p><p>"His passion for building bridges between people and groups is well known in our community, but it is his warmth, humor, and humanity that we miss most of all," Faris said. "To honor Tony's life's work with an award that recognizes the values he lived every day is a distinct honor for committee members and for the campus."</p><p>Speaker Jones, a champion for the toughest urban constituencies and causes, has won many honors, including the 1998 Reebok International Human Rights Award, the International Ashoka Fellowship, selection as a World Economic Forum "Young Global Leader," and the Rockefeller Foundation "Next Generation Leadership" Fellowship.</p><p>He is a tireless advocate, committed to creating "green pathways out of poverty" and greatly expanding the coalition fighting global warming.</p><p>Jones, said Faris, "is one of the most exciting advocates for social change in our time, particularly because of his focus on the interrelated character of the biggest issues we face: race, poverty, the environment, and human rights. His message is wholly consistent with the King legacy and is relevant to the generation that will make the change that will impact the shape of the world we live in."</p><p>Jones's organization, Green For All, promotes green-collar jobs and opportunities for the disadvantaged. Its mission is to build an inclusive, green economy--strong enough to resolve the ecological crisis and lift millions of people out of poverty.</p><p>In 2007, Jones helped the City of Oakland pass a "Green Jobs Corps" proposal. The city allocated funds to train Oakland residents in eco-friendly "green-collar jobs."</p><p>At the national level, he worked successfully in 2007 with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), U.S. Rep. Hilda Solis (D-Calif.), and U.S. Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.) to pass the Green Jobs Act of 2007. That path-breaking, historic legislation authorized $125 million in funding to train 35,000 people a year in "green-collar jobs."</p><p>In 2008, Green For All partnered with the Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection to launch the Green For All Academy. The Academy trains U.S. grassroots leaders to effectively advocate for an inclusive, green economy.</p><p>Jones also cofounded advocacy organizations the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Color of Change.</p><p>A 1993 Yale Law graduate, Jones, 40, lives in Oakland with his wife and two sons.</p><p>His books will be on sale at the event at the Bay Tree Bookstore table, along with books and materials on Black History Month and Martin Luther King Jr. </p><p>The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation was established during Robert Sinsheimer's tenure as chancellor. In addition to UCSC, the 2009 convocation is sponsored by the <i>Good Times,</i> KUSP, Inner Light Ministries, and the City of Santa Cruz.</p><p>For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/mlk/">King Memorial Convocation site</a>.</p><p>UCSC shuttles on the loop route leaving campus at 6:30 p.m., 6:45 p.m., and 7 p.m. will provide transportation to the Civic Auditorium and return to campus after the event. </p><p><!--<hr></p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> Jones will meet with student leadership at 4 p.m. February 12 at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room.

Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was also indicted on charges that he attempted to stop the investigation into abuses at the federal detention center in Texas.</p><p>This is a tremendous triumph for people in Texas who have been outraged by politicians who egregiously pursue their self-interest regardless of questionable criminal and moral implications. This is also a great victory for a county prosecutor who investigated the case and brought indictments against prominent politicians. Nevertheless, on December 1, a politically motivated county judge decided to dismiss the indictments returned by the grand jury.</p><p>The Fifth Amendment requires that charges for all capital and "infamous" crimes be brought by an indictment returned by a grand jury. However, the Supreme Court has held that this part of the Fifth Amendment is not binding on individual states, which can independently use grand juries or not, as they wish. </p><p>The root of all-citizen juries has been traced back to ancient Greece. They were employed in England and their civil watchdog functions were transplanted to the American colonies, where jurors publicly criticized officials for failing to maintain roads, bridges, public buildings, and jails; they issued reports compelling public officials to correct perceived wrongs, inefficiencies, and injustices. Grand juries exposed governmental abuses, determined tax rates, and suggested price controls for essential goods.</p><p>By the late 19th century, however, a strong movement to abolish the grand jury had emerged in many states. Opponents asserted that the system had outlived its original purpose, and many states discontinued its use. One exception was California, where a proposal to abolish grand jury inquests was rejected in 1902, mainly due to popular support for the exposure of municipal corruption, governmental abuse, and other wrongdoing.</p><p>Today, California continues to rely on the civil grand jury to oversee local governments. When the Sacramento County Grand Jury released its annual report last May, for example, the document included allegations of over-billing, credit card abuses, questionable travel expenses, and a kickback scheme involving a library director. </p><p>In April, the San Diego County Grand Jury described the dilapidated condition of a local jail, where floors had caved in and walls were rotting. Earlier the same month, the Kern County Grand Jury recommended relocating a morgue because the stench of dead bodies was hurting a nearby business, whose customers complained of "smelling rotten garbage or dirty diapers." </p><p>In California, grand juries have a long and honorable record of conducting their own independent civil investigations that expose corruption, mismanagement, and inefficiencies in local government. We need a similarly empowered civil grand jury at the federal level to investigate allegations of government wrongdoing that reach beyond the limited judicial boundaries of state jurisdictions.</p><p>In contrast to the federal criminal grand jury--the body that famously indicted I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby--a federal civil grand jury would watch over the operations of the federal government. Unlike criminal grand juries, which examine evidence compiled by prosecutors following criminal investigations, civil grand juries examine all aspects of government.</p><p>Impaneled annually with citizen jurors, federal civil grand juries could examine governmental institutions within each of several jurisdictions, including, for instance, regional offices of the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Veterans Affairs Department.</p><p>The establishment of a permanent, independent federal civil grand jury system would eliminate political constraints that might come from the executive, legislative, or even judicial branches of government. Jurors would be empowered to interview anyone germane to an investigation; to audit operations, accounts, records, and financial expenditures of all federal agencies; and to inspect government facilities.

<p>Now Ramirez, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in June with a degree in feminist studies, feels a responsibility to help people in difficult circumstances --including immigrants, the poor and working class, refugees, children, and abused women.</p>
<p>"I have a very personal connection to it because, among my family members and the community I live in, the majority of people are immigrants," said Ramirez, 22, who moved back to her hometown of Escondido after graduating. "So the struggles they go through, I've seen and felt."</p>
<p>Ramirez was one of two recipients of this year's UCSC Community Service Award. The $500 awards, presented annually to one or more graduating feminist studies seniors, were initiated in 2001 by local patrons Peggy Downes Baskin and Mary Solari.</p>
<p>Ramirez, a first-generation college student, interned at California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA) in Santa Cruz in 2007 and now plans to attend law school.</p>
<p>She provided translation services at CRLA, helped clients fill out paperwork, and called attorneys and social workers about clients' cases.</p>

<p>"It was good experience because it was a small place that needed a lot of help," Ramirez said.</p>
<p>Receiving the award "made me feel a sense of recognition," she said.</p>
<p>Her experience at CRLA taught her that "there's so much work to do for people who are low income, who don't get the same attention as others," Ramirez said. "There's so much work, but it's not paid as much as other jobs, and not a lot of people are willing to do it."</p>

She hopes education inspires others to build awareness about issues and transcend their perceived limits.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Before going to UCSC, I didn't know a lot," Ramirez said. "I learned so much there about being critical about my surroundings and how to put my passion for change into action."</p>
<p>Being away at college in Santa Cruz made her realize how much there was to do at home in Escondido.</p>
<p>"I'm from this community," she said. "I feel like I have a certain responsibility to it. I want to be here for a lot of the change that I would like to create."</p>

<p>Mateas, associate professor of computer science and a lead faculty member in UCSC's hot new computer game design program, predicts that the interactive structure of computer gaming will soon transform media as diverse as movies, visual art, fiction, documentaries, teaching materials, and even advertising.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mateas isn't envisioning the still somewhat wooden characters and simple plots that characterize today's blockbuster games. UCSC's young, dynamic game design faculty are shaping the next wave of "computational media" through research into artificial intelligence, complex "player-driven" story structures, and ways to express a player's unique aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>UCSC's new undergraduate game design major, established in fall 2006 in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, is helping fuel this revolution. Computer game design integrates UCSC's strong programs in computer science and the digital arts; it's one of the fastest growing majors on campus, with more than 200 students in fall 2008.</p>
<p>"This is already one of the top three computer game design programs in the country because we were able to build on great existing programs, as well as make some fantastic faculty hires," said Mateas, one of four core game design faculty in the Computer Science Department. "At UCSC, the faculty teaching undergraduate courses are actually creating the future of gaming through our research."</p>

</table>
And although it has "game" in the title, this program isn't child's play. Mateas notes that most majors have strong computer science backgrounds and want to use their skills in creative careers. The program is rigorous and hands-on, simulating a professional environment. In their senior year, student teams create near-professional-level games. With distinct pride, Mateas reports that a game designed by the first graduating class (2008) has sparked interest from a top gaming company.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Mateas is considered a pioneer for his work as codeveloper of FaÃ§ade, hailed as the first in a new genre. The FaÃ§ade "player" interacts with a troubled couple, Grace and Trip, and has a role in the fate of their marriage. The game flows so naturally that it's hard to remember the theoretical and computational complexity behind such believable interactions.</p>
<p>Mateas said he came to academia from the computer industry because it offered him more scope to mesh computer science with artistic expression, and because it gives him the opportunity to teach.</p>
<p>"Academia offers the freedom to really think about the future of computational media," he said, "and it's wonderful to help students invent that future."</p>

But that's changing almost as rapidly as Don Giovanni's amorous conquests.</p>
<p>UCSC's fully staged, professional-level Spring Opera productions have wowed regional audiences since 2000 and are now winning nationwide kudos as well. That recognition included a top award from the National Opera Association in 2006.</p>
<p>The Spring Opera is a year-round collaboration of the entire Music Department, with opera program director Brian Staufenbiel at the helm (he is also a singer and a member of UCSC's voice faculty). UCSC music professor and noted conductor Nicole Paiement serves as music director, preparing and conducting both the singers and orchestra.</p>
<p>Paiement and Staufenbiel are partners personally as well as professionally, and their shared enthusiasm for the opera program is infectious.</p>
<p>"Not only is music our deep passion," said Paiement, "but we both have a 'sky's the limit' approach and total commitment to the projects we take on."</p>
<p>Opera is complex and expensive to produce, which makes the program's success all the more impressive. Staufenbiel's and Paiement's zeal is put to the test annually with a grueling production schedule that begins a year in advance. They are now working on Mozart's <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> for spring 2009. Offerings alternate between classical operas (typically Mozart) and contemporary works such as Menotti's <em>The Consul</em> (2008) and Britten's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> (2006). Throughout the year, elements of the opera are integrated into seminars, master classes, and public performances.</p>
<p>Staufenbiel has high praise for the student performers, who include members of the full orchestra as well as vocal roles.</p>
<p>"We are one of the few undergraduate programs in the country doing opera at this level," he said. "We ask a lot of students, and they really deliver."</p>
<p>Paiement adds that the entire Music Department gets involved.</p>
<p>"We even have the jazz students coming on in speaking roles, and students from across the campus work behind the scenes," she said. "There's a wonderful sense of excitement and community."</p>

Every two years, the Music Department also presents a children's opera. This year, more than 700 kids and their parents enjoyed free performances of Humperdinck's <em>Hansel and Gretel,</em> and Staufenbiel wants to do more such performances. <br/>
<br/>
<p>"They introduce children not only to opera," he said, "but also to the UCSC campus."</p>
<p>"We've been very fortunate to enjoy strong community support for all UCSC's music events," said Paiement. "Santa Cruz audiences are sophisticated and curious artistically, which encourages us to be more adventurous as well."</p>

<p>A former Navy corpsman who spent a tour of duty treating patients in sweltering field hospitals in Kuwait, he had exactly $5 to his name. He had just been through a divorce and had been forced to sell his house at a loss. His health was damaged by years of heavy drinking.</p>
<p>But the 27-year-old Karrasch had loved treating patients in the Navy--the feel of serving others and saving lives. He dreamed of becoming an emergency room doctor.</p>
<p>"Once you have a goal, you just have to find a path to achieve that goal," said Karrasch, who learned the value of hard work from his disabled-veteran father.</p>
<p>The path led him to UCSC.</p>
<p>With his Navy retirement money, Karrasch bought a beat-up 23-foot travel trailer where he could live and got part-time jobs as a paramedic and a handyman. He began classes in psychology and biology, eventually choosing psychology as a major. But even though he loved the wooded campus, life as a student was still an uphill climb.</p>

After five years in the Navy, Karrasch had a hard time relating to the 18 and 20 year olds in his classes, and money was always on his mind. The list of courses he needed to get into medical school seemed daunting too.<br/>
<br/>
<p>But like most vets, he said, he had a hard time asking for help.</p>
<p>Then, Karrasch discovered a UCSC program called Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students, or STARS, which not only provided a quiet place to study, but showed him how to shave a year off school by tailoring his classes to the medical schools he wanted to attend.</p>
<p>He even learned he could have gotten a loan to tide him over through those first few weeks of school.</p>
<p>"STARS gave me a sense of family and a base of operations. It was wonderful support," said Karrasch.</p>
<p>So the man who believes in helping others agreed to help STARS develop a peer-mentor program for veterans. Called Veterans Education Team Support, it pairs vets on campus with incoming service people to ease the transition to university life.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Karrasch got an e-mail from a soldier in Iraq who wanted to know what it took to go to college when he returned. Karrasch directed the soldier to financial aid and admissions officers who could get him started.</p>
<p>And that, he said, made him feel good.</p>

Now, it not only provides tutoring and counseling for transfer students, single parents, and veterans, but it also helps them find housing, get financial aid, schedule classes, learn study skills, and even fit into the culture of university life. </p><p>More than 3,100 students came to the STARS program last year. But the fastest growing population the program serves now consists of veterans, according to Director Corinne Miller.

<p>So he was excited when his father, who had fled the country for political reasons, invited him to come and live in the United States. He imagined the car chases he would see, the cowboys that would ride through town.</p>
<p>But although Kebebew's life turned out to be something like a movie, it was not the one he had imagined. At 14, Kebebew found himself in California's foster care system, living with a family in the small town of Gilroy.</p>

<p>Even though he liked his foster family, Kebebew longed for his parents and felt the sting of being treated differently than the couple's biological children--things like not being allowed to open the refrigerator or having to earn points to participate in the activities he liked. But Kebebew remembered what his mother and grandmother had taught him and vowed not to become angry like some of the 50 to 60 other foster children who flowed through the house with their stories of horrific abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>It was then that he met the first of his "heroes," a junior high teacher who told Kebebew he should run for vice president of the class.</p>

"I said, 'My English barely works and I carry a soccer ball around with me,'" Kebebew, now 31, remembered. "I have a funny name and kids make fun of me." <br/>
<br/>
<p>But the teacher pressed, and Kebebew was elected vice president of his freshman class. Kebebew decided to throw himself into student government, clubs, and schoolwork as a way to keep the sadness and anger at bay. It was that choice that helped him win a prestigious Pister Leadership Opportunity Award at UC Santa Cruz, a $10,000-a-year grant that made it possible for him to attend UCSC. Kebebew was the 2000 recipient of the Thomas B. Porter Scholar award.</p>
<p>"I was so thankful for that opportunity and humbly grateful to the Thomas B. Porter family for their investment in my education," Kebebew said in a voice that still carries a lilting trace of his native country.</p>
<p>He also joined the Smith Scholastic Society, which provides mentors for former foster children at the university and encourages them to mentor others. "It was about creating a caring community," Kebebew said.</p>
<p>Four years later, Kebebew had an electrical engineering degree, but his heart took him back to the children he had met in foster care. He got a job with the Santa Cruz Community Counseling Center, where he worked with foster youth and is now involved in a major research project to study the impact of positive father involvement on children.</p>
<p>But Kebebew always remembers that first day at UCSC as he stood with a favorite social worker and watched parents carrying bags of groceries into the dorms for their children. So when two of the young people he mentors went to college, Kebebew was by their side.</p>
<p>"And I made sure they had all the groceries they needed," he said.</p>

Many have had to overcome enormous obstacles to get an education, or have been the first in their family to attend college. These are a few of the students who have received Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards.</p>
<p>Established in 1993 by Pister, the campus's sixth chancellor, the program fosters the transfer of accomplished students from regional community colleges to UCSC. All recipients receive a $10,000 scholarship for each of two years, the support of a strong academic mentoring program, and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.</p>

<p>"When I reflect on the impact of actions that I took as chancellor of UCSC, creation of the Leadership Opportunity Awards program stands out above all others," said Pister. "Through their careers, LOA alumni have brought distinction to the program and to UCSC. The many campus friends who contributed to the $6.1 million endowment that sustains the program have made a good investment in the future of California."</p>

The original sign was replaced this past summer with a nearly identical twin. Brothers Homer T. "Bud" McCrary and Frank "Lud" McCrary Jr. donated the first sign in 1965 at the behest of founding chancellor Dean McHenry. But over the years, weather, termites, and dry rot took their toll.</p>
<p>Campus officials approached them a couple of years ago wondering if they could find another piece of redwood--a big piece. Lud McCrary said he remembered a fallen snag that had lain on family property off Swanton Road, about five miles north of Davenport, for 25 years.</p>
<p>The old redwood had stood, although dead and scarred, for more than 100 years. Fire had hollowed its once 28-foot girth into a semicircle of charred wood. Then it fell, undermined by a surging Scott Creek after torrential rains inundated Santa Cruz County in January 1982.</p>
<p>The McCrarys hauled the fallen log back to their sawmill and managed to mill a solid timber nearly identical to the original, give or take half an inch. It's nearly 24 feet long, 44 inches high, and 19 inches thick, with clean, clear grain.</p>

"I am delighted we were able to maintain the natural character and simplicity of the original sign," Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "The redwood is a symbol of how this university campus blends into the land on which it's built."<br/>
<br/>
<p>The McCrary family first settled in the Swanton area in 1869, six generations ago, when Bud and Lud's great-grandmother moved with her husband and four-year-old son. Their father, Frank, arrived from Alaska in 1920. After returning from World War II, the two brothers founded Big Creek Timber Co. in 1946 with their father and uncle.</p>

<p>Today, the next generation is in place with Lud's daughter, Janet Webb, as chief forester. Now called Big Creek Lumber, the company is widely known as a careful steward of the land and has been hailed as an environmentally conscious logger by such groups as the Nature Conservancy and Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>

<p>The old sign, rotted in many places, was trucked back to Big Creek. Lud McCrary said he hopes to find enough solid wood to mill into something useful, perhaps shakes for historic buildings in the area. "We don't want to waste it," he said.</p>

There are so many nooks and crannies. It's phenomenally big," said anthropology professor and academy vice president Adrienne Zihlman, who is among the UCSC faculty who have been involved with the refurbishment. "I've been there more than five times, and I still see new things when I go."</p><p>Home to Steinhart Aquarium, Kimball Natural History Museum, and Morrison Planetarium, the academy's mission is to explore, explain, and protect the natural world through cutting-edge research, educational outreach, and public engagement. </p><p>"The California Academy has fantastic collections, including back to the Galapagos Islands in 1906," said Zihlman, who has been a fellow of the academy since 1983 and a science trustee since 1993. "The academy's numerous collections, such as insects and birds, are invaluable as tools for monitoring environmental change."</p><p>Zihlman, who called the exhibits "endlessly interesting," offered these tips for first-time visitors:</p><p>"You have to go into the rainforest, and be sure to see the show in the theater about planets and outer space--it's really phenomenal," she advised. "And don't miss the living roof. They're monitoring and collecting all kinds of data about the species of insects and birds that visit the roof, and they left a plot unplanted to see what comes in."</p><p>And, she said, "Be sure to see Claude, the white alligator. He's finally let his girlfriend share his rock with him. It took him a long time, but the last time I was there, he was sharing it with her."</p><p>The academy is governed by a group of up to 300 fellows, including more than two dozen distinguished scientists at UCSC. Some are playing significant roles in planning new activities for the renovated academy, including John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>"What I like especially about the new building is that it showcases real science," said Thompson. "Lots of places have style without substance, but the academy is presenting science with style, and they didn't water it down so much that you can't understand science as a process. You see biodiversity in the context of multiple species living together. You see little webs of life. That's what makes it a real 21st-century museum."</p><p>Exhibits help visitors appreciate the rapid impacts of climate change and the fragmentation of habitat, and the designers did "a very lovely job explaining the process of evolution," noted Thompson, a member of the academy's new six-member Science Advisory Committee, which was established in tandem with the reopening to develop novel ways of engaging the academy with the broader scientific community and enhancing its public outreach. </p><p>"We're brainstorming ideas," said Thompson, noting that the academy also encourages visitors to provide feedback that will help shape future exhibits and activities. "That flexibility makes it much more dynamic than a classic museum," he said.</p><p>The new facility, which opened September 27, emphasizes biodiversity and sustainability, said Zihlman, who encourages visitors to arrive when the doors open to avoid the crowds. "Wednesday is usually the 'quietest' day," she added. </p><p>"There are incredible docents on the floor," said Zihlman. "They are very well trained. People love them."</p><p>The new building is so well designed that it boasts more exhibits but takes up a smaller overall "footprint" than the previous facility, which allowed the academy to give land back to Golden Gate Park, noted Zihlman. </p><p>Nominated by their colleagues in recognition of notable contributions to one or more of the natural sciences, fellows are appointed by the Board of Trustees and remain members for life. In addition to Zihlman and Thompson, fellows from UCSC include Giacomo Bernardi; Mark Carr; Dan Costa; Daniel Doak; James Estes; Sandra Faber; Laurel Fox; Gregory Gilbert; Lynda Goff; David Haussler; Jean Langenheim, who received the Academy's highest honor, the Fellows Medal, in 2006; Leo Laporte; Burney LeBoeuf; Marc Mangel; Ingrid Parker; Vicki Buchsbaum Pearse; Donald Potts; Peter Raimondi; Barbara Rogoff; Mary Silver; Barry Sinervo; and Terrie Williams. In addition, honorary fellows from UCSC include William Doyle; Janet Leonard; Andrew Todd Newberry; and John Stuart Pearse. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91591b398072704601a012ff2645b017"><name>2624</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>End of fall quarter message from Chancellor Blumenthal</title><summary>End of fall quarter message</summary><description>End of fall quarter message</description><start-date>1228892400000</start-date><display-name>End of fall quarter...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2624</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2624</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338790137</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338790137</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As the fall quarter comes to an end, I want to reflect on a few issues and share some thoughts about the upcoming (calendar) year.</p><p>First, I know the turbulent economy and uncertain budget situation are a distraction and concern for many of you. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Dave Kliger, in collaboration with Academic Senate leadership and principal officers, has been pro-actively working to address anticipated mid-year cuts. History reminds us that we've weathered previous economic downturns. I'm confident we'll survive this one, as well.</p><p>In the meantime, UC Santa Cruz continues to make exceptional progress in its academic, research, and service mission.</p><p>I am very proud to note that eight of our students - all of whom have been studying abroad - recently were awarded Fulbright Scholarships for 2009. This is an extraordinary achievement, made more so by the fact that these eight awardees came from a campus applicant pool of only 14 - one of the highest proportional records of success in the nation.</p><p>Moreover, UCSC celebrates numerous other achievements this fall. A few examples:</p><p>    * Astronomy and Astrophysics research at UCSC ranks first in the nation for its impact, according to a new study.</p><p>    * Humanities Dean Georges Van Den Abbeele received the 2008 Blaise Pascal Medal for Social Sciences from the European Academy of Sciences in Brussels.</p><p>    * A prestigious Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering was awarded to Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, who joined UCSC last year, one of our new young faculty.</p><p>    * John Thompson, distinguished professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, who joined UCSC in 2000, has been named winner of an international award for his extraordinary contributions to the science of ecology.</p><p>    * UCSC's dining halls were ranked the nation's "greenest" by Plenty magazine, a major environmental publication.</p><p>    * UC Regents officially approved our long-anticipated Silicon Valley academic and research partnership with NASA, Carnegie Mellon and Santa Clara universities, and the DeAnza-Foothill Community College District.</p><p>It's increasingly clear that UC Santa Cruz is continuing its upward trajectory by demonstrating exceptional impact in the quality and importance of its research and teaching.</p><p>The coming year holds more promise. We will complete ongoing construction projects at the Cowell Student Health Center, Digital Arts and New Media building, Porter College dorms, and McHenry Library.</p><p>And, having reached consensus with city and county officials and a citizen's group on the campus long-range development plan, we will break ground soon on a new Biomedical Sciences building. UCSC is poised to be at the forefront in this area; interest in our health sciences majors is surging, as our stellar faculty attract unprecedented levels of support for their cutting-edge research. We must ensure that students, faculty, and staff have the classrooms, offices, and lab space necessary to support this vital work.</p><p>While public support underpins our mission, our future progress requires other sources of revenue. In 2009, we will embark on the initial critical phases to launch the first-ever comprehensive fund-raising campaign for UCSC. Especially in these challenging economic times, the time is clearly right for this effort.</p><p>In closing, I wish you all the best for a relaxing and enjoyable winter break and holiday season, and look forward to reconnecting with you in January.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91591e508072704601a012ff2d6e6c2b"><name>2626</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eight Slugs receive prestigious Fulbright grants </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz had eight Fulbright Program grantees in 2007-08--a feat it's only accomplished twice before in the past 15 years, and a higher ratio of accepted candidates versus applicants than many prestigious private universities.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Fulbright</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz had eight Fulbright Program grantees in 2007-08--a feat it's only accomplished twice before in the past 15 years, and a higher ratio of accepted candidates versus applicants than many prestigious private universities.</description><start-date>1229065200000</start-date><display-name>Eight Slugs receive prestigious...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2626</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2626</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338790937</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338790937</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/12/images/krupnik.tim.and.village.chief.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/12/images/krupnik.tim.and.village.chief.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>krupnik.tim.and.village.chief.300.jpg</name><file-size>33436</file-size><width>300</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Tim Krupnik with a village chief in Senegal. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/12/images/bastiaans.beth.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/12/images/bastiaans.beth.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bastiaans.beth.300.jpg</name><file-size>46255</file-size><width>300</width><height>249</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Beth Bastiaans weighing a male Sceloporus anahuacus in the Ajusco mountain range, Mexico state.

<p>UC Santa Cruz had eight Fulbright Program grantees in 2007-08--a feat it's only accomplished twice before in the past 15 years, and a higher ratio of accepted candidates versus applicants than many prominent private universities. UCSC had only 14 applicants to the public diplomacy program; Princeton University, which also claimed eight scholarship recipients, had 57 applicants.</p>
<p>"We just had outstanding students with exceptional projects," said Marlene Robinson, undergraduate honors and awards coordinator for the campus. "We are delighted that so many of our students were chosen for this wonderful opportunity. We know they will be outstanding ambassadors for our institution and for the United States."</p>
<p>Students apply and interview with a Fulbright committee on their home campus. Nominations then go to Fulbright headquarters, which sends the best proposals to the host country. The host country then makes its selections, said Robinson.</p>
<p>The UCSC Fulbright Review Committee members were Buchanan Sharp, professor of history and faculty director of the Education Abroad Program; Lani Giovanetti, former director of International Scholar and Student Services; and Robinson.</p>
<p>The eight Fulbrighters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elizabeth Bastiaans,</strong> who is studying a threatened lizard in Mexico; <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Frank Black,</strong> who is measuring mercury levels in water, fish, and hair of subsistence fishermen in Botswana;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>James Casey,</strong> who is conducting research on early 20th century Arab newspapers in Syria;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Timothy Krupnik,</strong> who is researching farming systems to improve rice production and natural resource conservation in Senegal;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Michelle Olsgard,</strong> who is investigating the sustainability of a fungus important to Chinese traditional medicine on the Tibetan Plateau;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Elizabeth Orr,</strong> who is studying the impact of global warming on insect populations in Sweden; <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Leah Samberg,</strong> who is researching the effects of a rapidly growing population on the biodiversity and sustainability of the agroecosystem of the Ethiopian highlands; <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Anna Zivian,</strong> who is addressing the growing trend of environmental policy and politics being contested at the local level in Austria.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Fulbrighters act as students, scholars, teachers, lecturers, researchers, mentors, artists, philanthropists, cultural ambassadors, and advocates.</p>

<p><strong>More than 1,450 U.S. citizens will travel abroad for the 2008-2009 academic year through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program.</strong></p>
<p><strong>America's flagship international educational exchange program, Fulbright is sponsored by the United States Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since its establishment in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the Fulbright Program has provided approximately 286,500 people--108,160 Americans who have studied, taught, or researched abroad and 178,340 students, scholars, and teachers from other countries who have engaged in similar activities in the United States--with the opportunity to observe each others' political, economic, educational, and cultural institutions, to exchange ideas, and to embark on joint ventures of importance to the general welfare of the world's inhabitants. The program operates in more than 155 countries worldwide.</strong></p>

"The Fulbright has been a huge help to my research by giving me a long, unbroken period of time in Mexico," said Beth Bastiaans, 24, in an email from central Mexico. "When I found out I had gotten it, I was both thrilled and relieved, since it removed a lot of obstacles and complications from my research plans."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Bastiaans, who grew up in Ames, Iowa, is sampling a number of populations of lizards in central Mexico to look for variation in a throat-color polymorphism that she thinks may be a marker for a mating strategy polymorphism, as her advisor, Barry Sinervo, has <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1610">found</a> in two other species of lizards.</p>
<p>James Casey, 21, of Sonoma, is working at the Center for Historical Documents in Damascus, doing research on the facility's extensive collection of early 20th century Arab newspapers. He is looking at contrasting accounts in the popular press of several key moments in the early years of the French Mandate. He's also taking Arabic classes at the University of Damascus.</p>
<p>"As there is relatively little scholarship on the Syrian popular press during the French Mandate and even less that examines popular political sentiments in the press, the potential for uncovering new information about the Mandate is significant," wrote Casey from Damascus.</p>
<p>Tim Krupnik, 32, who is originally from Indiana, Penn., is researching low-external input rice production and improving resource use efficiency in rice farming in Senegal.</p>
<p>"My work has been extremely challenging, as research always is, but conducting detailed work in a second language is always double the difficulty," wrote Krupnik from Senegal. "Nonetheless, it is also twice an accomplishment when things work and your results begin rolling in."</p>
<p>With the Fulbright, he wrote, "I have been able to deepen my research in ways I had not expected to, and I have branched out and am now conducting more locally relevant side studies on the ecology of rice production in Northern Senegal."</p>
<p>Lisa Orr, 26, of South Lake Tahoe, is living in Lund, Sweden, studying the impact of global warming on insect populations with Dr. Erik Svensson of Lund University.</p>
<p>"My research is going very well," Orr wrote from Lund. "I'm currently raising over 1,000 damselfly larvae in two temperature treatments and tracking their growth rate individually (quite an intense setup!). This fits into my original research goal, but since I've been here the direction of my research has evolved and I will hopefully be working on damselfly vision this summer as well as some molecular work."</p>
<p>Zivian, 41, of Telluride, Colo., is in Austria examining the trend of turning to local government as a new strategy of environmental mobilization.</p>
<p>"I'm enjoying being in Austria and meeting with scholars and interview subjects for my research," Zivian wrote from Austria. "The most important thing I have learned so far, as far as my research goes, is how in sync all levels of Austrian society--from local politicians to citizens to activists to farmers to national politicians--are in terms of their opposition to genetically modified organisms."</p>
<p>The Fulbrighters all spoke earnestly of their research goals, their progress, and their academic accomplishments. But there are other things to experience while they're abroad, too.</p>
<p>Casey, in Syria, plans to travel, taking the Torsos Express, the train from Aleppo, Syria, to Istanbul on which Agatha Christie's <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> begins.</p>
<p>Orr, in Sweden, described gamely trying the Swedish delicacy surstrÃ¶mming (canned fermented Baltic herring): "After a surstrÃ¶mming party, everyone is going to smell of rotten fish regardless of who opened the can."</p>
<p>And for Krupnik, being in Senegal has not been without its setbacks and surprises.</p>
<p>"There is always the bouts with salmonella poisoning and the quirky tropical illnesses that come with lots of time in the field," he wrote, "or the time when my truck broke down in the middle of nowhere and I hitched a ride back to the nearest village on the back of a farmer's donkey."</p>

Our doors are open and our future is bright. The Seymour Center's mission has never been more important. At a time when understanding and conserving the oceans are becoming increasingly important to our human health and survival, the cutting edge and innovative research conducted by scientists within the Institute of Marine Sciences and the educational programs and exhibits that describe and explain this research are at the core of the Seymour Center's efforts. As the Institute Director for 18 years, completing the Seymour Marine Discovery Center and seeing it flourish remains as one of the Institute's most important accomplishments, and one that has enriched the community and the lives of hundreds of thousands of visitors.</p><p>Do we have financial challenges? Certainly. The staff, volunteers and Friends of Long Marine Lab board of directors work seven days a week to run the center, plus plan, develop, and run the programs and events that raise the funds needed to operate the center. Every year, the Seymour Center raises approximately 85 percent of its nearly one million-dollar budget through nominal program fees and fundraising. It's not easy but we have been successful due to our many generous donors during the past eight years since the doors opened - and for the nearly 30 years there has been a public education program. These are difficult economic times for everyone, but we have no reason to believe that the Seymour Center is not up to meeting these challenges. Other than the last fiscal year, the Seymour Center has met or exceeded its operating budget and is not running a long-term deficit. Additionally, the Seymour Center is pleased to expand its efforts with the affiliation of the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, which will increase our opportunities for educational outreach and fund raising.</p><p>I am extremely proud of the Seymour Center and its staff and supporters. It is one of the University's greatest public outreach programs. We sincerely appreciate the continued support of the campus and the community.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Institute of Marine Sciences faculty, staff and students</audience><admin>Gary Griggs, IMS Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91592cf18072704601a012ff4125dc21"><name>2636</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our University - Yudof budget message</title><start-date>1229410800000</start-date><display-name>Our University - Yudof...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2636</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2636</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338794679</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338794679</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Our University, the Office of the President newsletter for UC faculty and</p><p>staff, is available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/ouruniversity/12_08">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/ouruniversity/12_08</a></p><p>Highlights from this issue include:</p><p>* President Yudof message and video: Budget outlook</p><p>* From premise to products: Find out where your campus or lab's inventions</p><p>are going.</p><p>* Admissions changes: Freshman eligibility proposal</p><p>* More stories include: Green clean at UCSB, global AIDS outreach at UCSF</p><p>and more.</p><p>A printer-friendly link is featured under the newsletter's date in the</p><p>upper-left corner.

<p>Potts gave an invited talk on "Geobiological Responses to Ocean Acidification" at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in San Francisco on Wednesday, December 17.</p>
<p>Ocean acidification is one of the side effects of the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. The oceans can absorb enormous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but as the gas dissolves it makes the water more acidic. Increasing acidity can make life difficult for corals and other marine organisms that build shells and skeletons out of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>Scientists fear that acidification will slow the growth of these organisms and cause calcium carbonate structures to dissolve. Potts agrees that dissolving shells will certainly be a problem for many marine organisms, but he thinks the disruptions will run much deeper.</p>
<p>"It's not just a question of coral reefs, and it's not just a question of calcification," he said. "What we are potentially looking at are disruptions of developmental processes and of populations and communities on many scales."</p>
<p>The term "acidification" refers to a slight lowering of the pH of ocean water, pushing it closer to the acidic end of the scale, although it is still slightly alkaline. A small decrease in pH affects the chemical equilibrium of ocean water, reducing the availability of carbonate ions needed by a wide range of organisms to build and maintain structures of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>Many phytoplankton--microscopic algae that form the base of the marine food web--build calcium carbonate shells to protect themselves from microscopic predators called ciliate protozoa. A disruption of the ability of phytoplankton to build their shells could have ripple effects throughout the marine food web, Potts said.</p>
<p>"It's going to change the dominant organism in the food chain, and there's a very real danger that it may short-circuit the food chains," he said. In other words, ciliate protozoa gorging on unprotected phytoplankton may flourish at the expense of other organisms higher up the food chain.</p>
<p>But calcification of shells is not the only biological process affected by acidification, Potts added. "All biochemical physiological reactions are potentially going to change," he said. Developing organisms are most likely to be affected, due to their low range of environmental tolerances, but it is unclear what the ecological ramifications will be.</p>
<p>Ocean acidification may not affect all parts of the oceans equally. Within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of shore, the pH of ocean water is more variable than in the rest of the ocean. Fresh water and wind from the land can carry chemicals that alter the pH of near-shore water, making it either more acidic or more alkaline. There may be organisms in this region that are already starting to adapt to changes in ocean acidity, Potts said.</p>
<p>"We should be thinking in terms of triage," he said. "We want to be predicting where are the organisms that are most likely to survive or survive the longest, and this is where we should be concentrating our conservation and management efforts, given finite resources."</p>

No one was injured.</p>
<p>UCSC Police believe the vandalism occurred shortly after midnight. It includes:</p>
<p>&#8226; Broken windows at Kresge College's Owl's Nest Cafe.<br/>
&#8226; Tires slashed and windows damaged on as many as 20 vehicles, including Physical Plant trucks adjacent to the campus's Cogeneration Power Facility and an electric car at Kresge College.<br/>
&#8226; Damage to construction equipment at Porter College.<br/>
&#8226; Broken windows at University House.<br/>
&#8226; Graffiti at several locations, including Porter College residence halls and the Core West Parking Structure.</p>
<p>In addition to these acts of vandalism, a number of "road spikes" were found on Meyer Drive. UCSC Police have inspected campus roads and believe they have found all of these spikes, which are designed to damage tires of moving vehicles. But they are urging members of the UCSC community and public at large to use extra caution while driving through campus.</p>
<p>UCSC Police are also asking for assistance in the identification of the people responsible for these dangerous and damaging acts of vandalism. Detective Steve Garcia can be contacted directly by phoning the UCSC Police Office at 831/459-2231. Reports may also be made anonymously by calling 831/459-3TIP (459-3847) or submitted via the Internet at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/crime.html">http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/crime.html</a>.</p>

They are Phillip Crews, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; Darrell Long, professor of computer science in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering; and Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. </p><p>Election as a fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. The association's council voted to award this honor to 486 members this year in recognition of their distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. The new fellows will receive a certificate and a commemorative pin during a ceremony at the 2009 AAAS annual meeting in Chicago. There are now 29 AAAS Fellows on the UCSC faculty.</p><p>Crews was recognized for "distinguished contributions to the fields of marine natural products and organic structure analysis." He is among the pioneers in the exploration of the chemistry of marine natural products, having spent decades investigating the pharmacological potential of compounds derived from marine sponges, fungi, and other organisms. Earlier this year, Crews received the 2008 Research Achievement Award from the American Society of Pharmacognosy.</p><p>Long, the Kumar Malavalli Professor of Storage Systems Research, was honored for his contributions to computing systems, particularly high-performance storage systems. He directs the Storage Systems Research Center in the Baskin School of Engineering, a leading center for research on data storage and storage systems. Long has broad research interests in the area of computing systems, including operating systems, distributed systems, high-performance storage systems, fault tolerance, performance evaluation, mobile computing, and security issues. He serves as associate dean for research and graduate studies in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>Mascharak was recognized for "distinguished contributions to the field of bioinorganic chemistry, particularly in understanding how metalloenzymes work." His research focuses on enzymes that contain metal ions (metalloenzymes), with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of the complex biological transformations that take place at the metal-containing active sites of these enzymes. Mascharak's group is also investigating the use of metal nitrosyls as agents in photodynamic therapy, in which light triggers the release of therapeutic doses of nitric oxide at targeted sites, such as localized cancers.</p><p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world's largest general scientific society, and publisher of the journal Science. AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes some 262 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving 10 million individuals. Science has the largest paid circulation of any peer-reviewed general science journal in the world, with an estimated total readership of 1 million. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915938cb8072704601a012ffc51dfd00"><name>2643</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Math professor Alexander Gamburd wins Presidential Early Career Award</title><summary>Alexander Gamburd, professor of mathematics at UCSC, has won a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the White House announced today.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><description>Alexander Gamburd, professor of mathematics at UCSC, has won a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the White House announced today.</description><start-date>1229670000000</start-date><display-name>Math professor Alexander Gamburd...</display-name><path>/2008/12/2643</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/2643</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338797712</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338797712</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/12/images/gamburd_alexander.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/12/images/gamburd_alexander.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gamburd_alexander.150.jpg</name><file-size>34333</file-size><width>150</width><height>189</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Alexander Gamburd</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alexander Gamburd, professor of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has won a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the White House announced today.</p><p>The PECASE awards are the highest honor that a beginning scientist or engineer can receive in the United States.

<p>Earth scientist Mark Snyder presented the findings in a poster titled "Future Changes in Surface Winds in the Western U.S. due to Climate Change" at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in San Francisco on Friday, December 19.</p>
<p>Snyder's group used a regional climate model to study how the climate along the U.S. West Coast might change in the future as a result of global warming driven by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The results suggest that a general increase in wind speeds along the coast is likely to accompany regional changes in climate.</p>
<p>"What we think is going on is that land temperatures are increasing at a faster rate than the ocean temperatures, and this thermal gradient between the land and the ocean is driving increased winds," Snyder said.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted multiple runs of their regional model to compare simulations of the coastal climate for two time periods: 1968 to 2000 ("modern climate") and 2038 to 2070 ("future climate"). The regional model was driven by input from the global climate models used in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4). The future climate projections were based on a "high-growth" emissions scenario (A2) thought to provide an upper range of possible future climates, although Snyder noted that recent global carbon dioxide emissions have exceeded even the highest projections of earlier IPCC reports.</p>
<p>The results showed increases in wind speeds of up to 2 meters per second, which is a large change in relation to current average wind speeds of about 5 meters per second, Snyder said. One effect of these increased winds may be earlier and more intense upwelling of cold water along the coast.</p>
<p>Upwelling is generally a good thing, bringing up nutrient-rich deep water to support thriving coastal ecosystems. But researchers think too much upwelling may be causing the massive "dead zone" that has begun to appear with alarming regularity off the Oregon coast. According to an earlier study by Oregon researchers, intense upwelling driven by stronger, more persistent winds stimulates excessive growth of phytoplankton (microscopic algae), which ultimately sink to the bottom and decompose, sucking oxygen out of the bottom waters.</p>
<p>Snyder said these conditions may become more prevalent in the future, and stronger winds all along the coast may cause the Oregon dead zone to expand into California waters.</p>
<p>Strong winds can also create extremely hazardous fire conditions, as was seen this fall in Southern California. On the positive side, strong winds would be good for the growing wind energy industry. Snyder also noted that an enhanced sea breeze during the warm months of the year has a cooling effect along the coast. Such a cooling trend could have many ramifications, particularly for coastal species adapted to seasonal changes in temperatures and fog, he said.</p>
<p>Snyder's coauthors are graduate student Travis O'Brien and Lisa Sloan, professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of the Climate Change and Impacts Lab.</p>

UCSC students, Lara Hale commutes by bike or bus, washes her laundry in cold water, and avoids plastic water bottles.</p>
<p>But Hale is one of only a few students who traveled last summer to the Lolland region of Denmark, where residents are overcoming their dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>As part of a first-ever university exchange program, Hale visited wind farms, biogas plants, and waste incineration facilities. She and about 20 other students from California and Denmark immersed themselves in renewable energy projects and learned from Danes who made a commitment in the 1970s to become energy independent.</p>
<p>"Seventy percent of the electricity they generate is from renewable sources," said Hale. "The trip showed me that it's possible." Hale attributes Lolland's success to a three-pronged focus on research, product development, and a level of community involvement that encompasses decision making and investment.</p>
<p>"Lolland is particularly interesting because it's a less well-to-do area, and it was economically depressed in the 1970s," she said. "They started with wind power. They rejected nuclear energy as too risky and too expensive." Wind farms and biogas plants are co-owned by residents, with neighbors who live closest to the facilities owning more shares. "So it isn't just about where I live but what I'm invested in monetarily, as well," Hale explained. Hale, who calls herself a "technological optimist," was particularly impressed by a municipal waste incineration process that has reduced dioxin production by 99 percent since 1988. "It's important not to be a naysayer just because the technology isn't here now. You create it," she said.</p>
<p>Hale was selected to participate in the summer program after taking a course in renewable energy sources from Ali Shakouri, a professor of electrical engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. "He has a great interest in placing our current energy issues in the context of history," she said. "That class really gave me a sense of how central our energy usage is to climate change. Energy is becoming my main interest." A re-entry student, Hale, 26, is a third-year senior with a combined major in biology and environmental studies. She credits a 10-month stint with AmeriCorps for igniting her passion for environmentalism. "It spoils you. You get accustomed to spending all day outdoors," recalled Hale, who helped document the degradation of streams that flow into Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>Hale chose UCSC for its interdisciplinary environmental studies program, as well as for its natural beauty and proximity to San Francisco. Favorite classes so far include a course in aquatic toxicology with professor Russ Flegal--"He's outstanding"--and a course about United States and Middle East energy politics called <em>Blood and Oil</em> with environmental studies professor Alan Richards. "It's the kind of class that's so good it's hard to sit through," she said. "You feel the weight of the world."</p>
<p>Hale is making the most of her college experience. She helped environmental studies professor Greg Gilbert establish a research plot on the UCSC forest reserve ("He is incredibly knowledgeable, supportive, patient, and has such high hopes for we undergrads," she said of Gilbert), and she is currently helping shape the nascent Sustainable Engineering and Ecological Design (SEED) program. Hale completed an internship in the campus Sustainability Office and now works part time as a classroom assistant for the electrical engineering class <em>Sustainability Engineering and Practices</em>. In January, she heads to South Africa with the Education Abroad Program.</p>
<p>With an eye toward graduate study in either international relations or urban planning, Hale considers herself part of the "dying breed" of students pursuing a liberal-arts education. "Students are eager to focus, to start working and to make a difference," she said. "But I'm here to learn, not just to do."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2736d2e8072704601a012ff01dbc70a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625727628</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625727628</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
