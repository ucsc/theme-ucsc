Photo by Jim MacKenzie.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nearly 1,000 aspiring teachers in San Francisco and San Diego will learn cutting-edge techniques for teaching science to young children whose first language isn't English as part of a collaboration led by UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>The needs of English language learners are a high priority because they now make up about 20 percent of all K-12 students in the United States--and nearly 50 percent of students in California, according to UCSC education professor Trish Stoddart, who is leading the collaboration. </p><p>"A major problem is that most teachers are not being prepared to teach subject matter to English language learners," said Stoddart. "Our goal is to change the way we prepare novice teachers." </p><p>Stoddart has developed, tested, and refined new strategies to help students who do not speak English as their first language learn science. With $3.1 million from the National Science Foundation, she is sharing her model with faculty at San Diego State University and San Francisco State University, who will integrate Stoddart's instructional practices into their programs. Aspiring teachers will use those techniques during their stints as student teachers, as well as in their jobs after graduation. Ultimately, youngsters in kindergarten through sixth grade will benefit from the integrated approach to science and language instruction.</p><p>Stoddart's approach engages students in the phenomena they're studying, which generates what she called a "synergistic" effect. "It brings science alive, which provides a very powerful context for learning language, because it gives the words meaning," said Stoddart. "There's a reciprocal relationship between language and science. The learning in each domain enhances the learning in the other."</p><p>Educational experts hope to reverse two troubling trends: a "pattern of underachievement" among English language learners marked by test scores that are about 20 percent lower than the scores of native English speakers, and the declining number of students choosing careers in science.</p><p>"There are national and international concerns about low levels of science achievement," said Stoddart, a member of a binational U.S./United Kingdom task force on science education that aims to encourage more students in both countries to study science.</p><p>The success of Stoddart's model hinges on an approach that bridges the divide between science and language instruction, which aspiring teachers typically learn about in separate courses. Instead, CSU faculty will teach science and language instruction together, and instruction will emphasize the use of contextualization, collaborative inquiry, and instructional conversations.</p><p>"Teachers learn to teach science in ways that engage students," said Stoddart. "Hands-on science activities are related to the local environment, whether it's the ocean, weather patterns, or local plants and animals. They are related to parts of their everyday lives." </p><p>Language lessons relate to hands-on activities and objects. "Vocabulary is never taught by just listing words on the blackboard," said Stoddart. "When a teacher uses a word, it's related to a physical object or activity or to a picture or graphic representation."</p><p>"You can learn as many new words in a science lesson as you learn in a foreign language lesson," said Stoddart. "Science is very language rich."</p><p>Stoddart has developed this portfolio of strategies during more than two decades of research. Her methods have been adopted by the teacher-education program in UCSC's Education Department and implemented in some local schools, but now it's time for wider implementation, she said.</p><p>"Our role at UC is research," said Stoddart. "We develop model programs. When we've got a successful model, we need to go beyond UC and scale it up. We're hoping to have impact statewide."</p><p>California State University campuses prepare about 10 percent of the nation's teachers. This project will reach nearly 1,000 aspiring teachers in San Diego and San Francisco over the next three years. Half will be introduced to Stoddart's model of integrated teaching, and half will learn the traditional approaches to teaching science and language arts. Stoddart's team will monitor and compare the impacts of teachers in each group during their stints as student teachers and into their first year of classroom teaching.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, Jerome Shaw, an assistant professor of education at UCSC, will assess the science achievement of K-6 students taught by both cohorts of aspiring teachers in school districts with high proportions of English language learners. The study of student achievement will involve up to 25,000 public school students over the next five years.</p><p>"The research will focus on proving the efficacy of these techniques in teacher preparation and on the impact of this pedagogy on K-6 students," said Stoddart.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Trish Stoddart may be reached at (831) 459-3850 or via e-mail at stoddart@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91588f018072704601a012ff13f100f0"><name>2532</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Donald Coyne, adjunct professor emeritus of physics</title><summary>Donald G.

Coyne, retired adjunct professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, passed away on October 1, 2008, in Santa Cruz, after a decade-long fight against cancer.</p>
<p>Don was the quintessential elementary particle physicist from the era in which researchers proposed, performed, and published the results of experiments in two- to three-year cycles and were at ease with all aspects of the trade, from the craft-like to the more mathematical ones. Don's career spanned particle physics from hadron spectroscopy, pursued with bubble chambers, through the first decades of electron-positron storage rings up to the present times when collaborations of many hundreds of physicists build very large experimental facilities at colliders.</p>
<p>In the last two decades, he led his group into very-high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics. To him, it was a way to approach the problems at the interface of particle physics and gravity, which he mused about during the decades he spent at particle accelerators and to which he actively contributed from the early 1990s continuing through the years of his retirement.</p>
<p>Don was born in 1936 in Hutchinson, Kansas. He obtained a B.S. in engineering physics from the University of Kansas in Lawrence in 1958, and a Ph.D. in experimental particle physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1967. His postdoctoral years (1966-70) were spent at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (LRL) in Berkeley, California, and were followed by fifteen years at Princeton University, first as assistant professor and then as senior research physicist.</p>
<p>In 1985, he moved with the research group he was leading to the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP), where he served as adjunct professor until his retirement in 2002. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>A description of the highlights of Don's scientific career necessarily begins with his thesis research, which consisted of performing a bubble-chamber photoproduction experiment from scratch at the CalTech electron synchrotron. He redesigned, rebuilt, and put through its paces a heavy-liquid bubble chamber, designed and built the photon beam, performed the experiments to measure the reactions <em>γp → π<sup>+</sup>π‾p and γd → Κ<sup>O</sup>Λ<sup>O</sup>, Κ<sup>O</sup>Σ<sup>O</sup></em>, reconstructed and analyzed the final states, and finally published the results. It was a one-man <em>tour de force,</em> during which he perfected his characteristic mixture of intellectual strength, inventiveness, self-reliance, depth, and scientific rigor.</p>
<p>This training served him well throughout his career, beginning with a number of experiments as a member of the Trilling-Goldhaber group at LRL, and continuing in the Princeton group initially led by the late G. K. O'Neill and subsequently by Don himself. During these years he was a co-discoverer and one of the main analyzers of ρ−ω interference and played an important part in a stationary-target experiment at Brookhaven National Lab. He then led a number of small experiments at SPEAR that produced evidence for the then-disputed τ lepton and helped to put in order the charmonium system during the heady years around the discovery of the J/ψ in 1974.</p>
<p>His tenure as senior research physicist at Princeton coincided with his leading the group into the Crystal Ball experiment, which discovered or made precision measurements of several states involving radiative transitions in the charmonium system. Among Don's more original ideas of those years was his proposal to search for gluonium states in the radiative decays of the J/ψ (and later of the Upsilon family). On the more experimental side, he was the first in proposing and later had a pioneering role in establishing the use of BGO crystal calorimeters in particle physics. This work resulted in several major experiments based on this technique by groups other than his.</p>
<p>An amateur interest in astronomy nurtured since his youth took root professionally when Don's group joined the CYGNUS and Milagro very-high-energy gamma-ray experiments at Los Alamos. This was the initial step extending the scope of experimental work at SCIPP into astrophysics, which has now become a major area of research in the Institute. He used CYGNUS and Milagro to search for emission from gamma-ray bursts observed by satellite-borne detectors, as well as for bursts from the Hawking radiation of exploding small black holes. The latter initiative marked the beginning of his active involvement in research on the possible connection between the quantization of small black holes and the fundamental particle spectrum. He remained passionately engaged in this topic to his very last days, eagerly awaiting what the first data from the LHC would have to say on the subject.</p>
<p>Don was extraordinarily generous as a teacher and mentor. He actively promoted younger colleagues and never hesitated to stand aside, giving them opportunities for exposure and recognition. In addition to advising Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows, he devoted hundreds of hours to working closely with students on undergraduate theses. Over the course of his career, particle physics and astrophysics evolved from small projects to big science, where there is a risk of losing contact with the motivating science. Don's enthusiasm for the science always came through and inspired those around him.</p>
<p>Don had a love of mountains and the outdoors, manifest in his younger days by a passion for climbing and in more recent years by his choice to live in the rural Bonny Doon mountains above Santa Cruz, where he was active in the local community. In his retirement, Don became an avid flier of powered-parachute ultralight aircraft. He shared his exhilaration with family and friends whom he took aloft in the two-seat, open-air craft.</p>
<p>At all times of his life Don could be found to be deeply involved in one or several of the many projects he engaged in--physics, of course, ranging from the speculative to the highly technical--but also building houses of his own design for his family, flying, or cultivating personal relationships. Don freely communicated his original ideas, his opinions, and his findings to those he was close to, personally or professionally, by word or by example. His influence on all these persons has been profound and will be long lasting.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Melanie Mayer, professor emerita of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, daughters A. Heather Coyne and Gwendolyn Coyne, sister Juliet Johnson-Cassady, and brother Michael Coyne.</p>

Rau's concept for a method to produce "green" hydrogen was chosen from more than 300 applications.</p>
<p>"Out of the blue I got a phone call saying that I was one of the top five finalists," said Rau, who is affiliated with the Carbon Management Program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. "I was quite surprised and pleased to be part of that."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/Tech/energyprize/index.htm">ConocoPhillips Energy Prize</a>, a joint initiative by ConocoPhillips and Pennsylvania State University, is designed to recognize new ideas and original, actionable solutions that can help improve the way the United States develops and uses energy. The prize includes $25,000 for the finalists to further develop their concepts. This is the first year the prize has been awarded.</p>
<p>Rau's concept proposes to use renewable energy, such as wind, wave, or solar, for both the production of hydrogen and the generation of carbon-dioxide-absorbing solutions. A novel electrolysis cell would simultaneously split water and mineral carbonate, producing hydrogen gas and dissolved mineral hydroxide. The resulting alkaline solution would absorb carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere or from waste gas streams.</p>
<p>This carbon-negative electrolytic hydrogen technology could have many benefits, Rau said. It would reduce our carbon footprint by pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and it would generate hydrogen, which may someday be used to power cars. In addition, the alkaline solution it generates could be used to help neutralize the ongoing acidification of the oceans that is resulting from carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<p>The center's First Anniversary Symposium on Friday, November 14, will feature presentations by UCSC researchers, a tour of the center, and a keynote address by James McKerrow, director of the Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases at UCSF. The symposium will take place from 2 to 5 p.m. in the Physical Sciences Building, Room 240. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>With an array of robotic equipment and other sophisticated tools for handling and analyzing thousands of samples at a time, the UCSC Chemical Screening Center automates the process of testing chemical compounds for potentially useful biological effects.</p>
<p>"We've already found some very exciting leads," said Scott Lokey, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry and lead investigator of the center.</p>
<p>Ongoing projects at the center include screening procedures for identifying compounds that are active against malaria, cholera, fungal diseases, and bacterial infections. Lokey and his collaborators have also discovered a compound that appears to be a more potent analog of a widely used cancer drug.</p>
<p>The identification of compounds that could be developed into new drugs is just one of the goals of chemical screening. In addition, biologically active compounds can be extremely valuable as research tools even if they are not promising candidates for drug development, Lokey said.</p>
<p>The compounds being tested at UCSC come from a variety of sources, including a large library of synthetic compounds, as well as tens of thousands of natural products derived from marine organisms by UCSC biochemists.</p>
<p>"Our marine natural products library is a truly unique collection," Lokey said. "Natural products are generally more potent, more specific, and more exciting to chemists and biologists than commercial compounds."</p>
<p>McKerrow's lab at UCSF is collaborating with UCSC researchers Phil Crews and Roger Linington to screen their collections of marine natural products for chemicals that are active against the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. Crews, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, has run the Marine Natural Products Laboratory at UCSC for more than 20 years, focusing on chemicals isolated from sponges and marine fungi. Linington's lab isolates compounds from bacteria that live in marine sediments.</p>
<p>"The collaboration on African sleeping sickness is still in the early stages, but the results so far are very encouraging. We have products in the pipeline that look promising," said Linington, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>Linington is also working with Fitnat Yildiz, associate professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology, to find compounds that are active against <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, the microbe that causes cholera.</p>
<p>"The Chemical Screening Center is invaluable to our research," Linington said. "It is allowing us to explore projects and strategies in natural-products chemistry which would otherwise be impractical or impossible."</p>
<p>According to Lokey, one of the big challenges has been to efficiently process and analyze the huge quantities of data generated by the center's "high-throughput" screening procedures, which generate tens of thousands of data points from each experiment. Fortunately, a collaboration with bioinformatics experts in the Baskin School of Engineering has yielded powerful computational tools for analyzing the chemical screening data. Joshua Stuart, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, and graduate student Marcos Woehrmann worked closely with Lokey to develop new data mining software.</p>
<p>"Marcos created a nice visual interface on the computer to help people mine their data for useful information," Lokey said. "I had not anticipated how central data mining would be to the screening process, so it's fortunate we had this collaboration."</p>
<p>The Chemical Screening Center's First Anniversary Symposium is sponsored by the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3), the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, Agilent Technologies, Perkin Elmer, Collaborative Drug Discovery, and MDS Analytical Technologies. The center is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of State, and QB3.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker James McKerrow is the Smith Professor of Experimental Pathology at UCSF and also holds appointments in cellular and molecular pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry. The Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases, which he directs, is a consortium of core laboratories supporting development of new drugs for global parasitic diseases largely ignored by the pharmaceutical industry, such as African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease.</p>

"Everything came together for Barack Obama. It's a decisive victory."</p><p>The election of the nation's first African American president was stunning in ways that fuse symbolism and substance, said politics professor Daniel Wirls.</p><p>"It is extraordinary," said Wirls. "This election has produced change because the unthinkable has happened, and that will change our perceptions of what is ordinary--not just in the sense of what's possible for African Americans, but also for whites who didn't necessarily want this, because they'll see that the sky is not falling."</p><p>Like many, David Anthony, an associate professor of history who specializes in African American history, said he was astonished by Obama's victory. </p><p>"There's nothing that compares with this," said Anthony, who is black. "This is really a new dawn."</p><p>"I think young people aren't having that hard a time believing it, but if you've been trained by experience to be cautious, skeptical, cynical or just plain hurt, it'll take a very, very long time to just accept this," said Anthony. "I think it's something that not just our entire society but the whole world is confronting now."</p><p>Obama's election presents an opportunity for racial healing, but Anthony said that's a collective responsibility. </p><p>"This is a big step, but it puts a lot of weight on one person to suggest it's within their power to fix (race relations)," said Anthony. "I think Obama's victory could be an inspiration to all of us who would like to see that change and are willing to work to make it a reality. It is within our grasp."</p><p>Campus political experts said the nation's staggering economy bolstered support for Obama across the country, as did widespread dissatisfaction with President Bush. Obama's victory was also boosted by his superb campaign organization and a tremendously successful fundraising effort, and he benefited from Republican Sen. John McCain's weak campaign, they said.</p><p>Wirls, who studies the presidency and Congress, expects Obama to pursue "moderately liberal policies" and to have an opportunity to work with moderate Republicans in the Senate. </p><p>Kamieniecki, calling Obama "a very inspiring, talented, smart individual," anticipates a successful first term for the president-elect.</p><p>"If he governs as a moderate who reaches across the aisle, he'll be very successful," predicted Kamieniecki. "Republicans need to step up to the plate. They got a whooping."</p><p>Hundreds of students marched across campus on Tuesday night in celebration, said Victor Sanchez Jr., vice chair of external affairs for the Student Union Assembly, a third-year senior majoring in sociology and Latin American and Latino studies.</p><p>"I'm enthralled," said Sanchez. "We've turned a corner, and we're going in a new direction that the majority of the youth vote desired."</p><p>"I'm really excited. I have a smile on my face, and it's enlightening to have everybody behind the new president," said Sanchez, who helped register 3,698 new student voters on campus. Systemwide, more than 40,000 new voters were registered on UC campuses, he said.</p><p>Sanchez is eager to see Obama follow through on campaign promises to fund higher education and make college more accessible for students. "I hope the president-elect and Congress hit the floor running," he said.</p><p>Professor of economics Lori Kletzer said she was "very encouraged" by Obama's victory.</p><p>"Everything we've heard over the past six weeks as the economy has melted down indicates that the president-elect has an understanding of the severity of the problems and an understanding of the kinds of policies that will be required to address the financial market's problems and the recession we're in the midst of," she said. </p><p>The economy and health care should be at the top of Obama's list, and he'll need to bring a commitment to fiscal discipline to both issues, she said. "He hasn't said as much as I think he needs to say about how he's going to pay for everything," she said. But his support among high-income voters, who will face higher taxes under an Obama administration, indicates strong support for fiscal responsibility, she said.</p><p>For many, the apparent passage of Proposition 8 put a damper on an otherwise festive mood. The success of the proposal to deny same-sex couples the right to marry was a sign of the state's "quirky populism," said Kamieniecki.</p><p>"California is quite liberal on economic issues but moderate to conservative on social issues," he said. "I've never gotten my finger on the true soul of the California electorate."</p><p>Sanchez expressed disappointment with the passage of Prop. 8--but also determination.</p><p>"A lot of us are deeply saddened, but it's a kind of motivation," said Sanchez. "We're not going to stop. It's one more obstacle to jump over to be the change we want to see."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91589ce78072704601a012ff8346e63c"><name>2541</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus provost provides 2008-09 budget update</title><start-date>1226041200000</start-date><display-name>Campus provost provides 2008-09...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2541</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2541</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338757804</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338757804</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am writing to update you on our budget situation. Yesterday, the Governor</p><p>proposed a series of mid-year state budget cuts and revenue enhancements.</p><p>The proposed mid-year cut to UC, systemwide, would be $98 million.  We do</p><p>not know what UC Santa Cruz's share of these proposed cuts would be.</p><p>Here is what we do know:</p><p>*  Prior to any mid-year cuts, state support for UC this year had remained</p><p>essentially unchanged from 2007-08. We received no additional funding for</p><p>mandated cost increases, making this a de facto budget cut.</p><p>*  Meanwhile, in a year of unsurpassed demand, UC absorbed all expected</p><p>undergraduate enrollment growth without enhanced state funding to support</p><p>it. UCSC has funded its own enrollment growth through campus operating</p><p>funds and imaginative, diligent efforts by many academic and administrative</p><p>staff.</p><p>Given these conditions, I advised principal officers to implement a $4.5</p><p>million budget reduction for our campus.

<p>UC Santa Cruz's newest Friends group, <a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu/index.shtml">Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a>, aims to protect historical evidence such as this, as well as significant structures on campus dating from the 19th century.</p>
<p>"I think it's very important that we preserve that for future generations," said Frank Perry (College 8, '77), chairman of the board of the new Friends group and co-author of <a href="http://www.limekilnlegacies.com/"><em>Lime Kiln Legacies</em></a>, which traces the history of lime making in Santa Cruz County from 1791 to 1946.</p>
<p>"It's a really an interesting story," said Perry. "The area at the entrance to campus was the epicenter for lime making in California after the Gold Rush. It was the largest lime-making plant in the state at one time, so preserving the history has statewide significance--it's not just a local Santa Cruz thing."</p>
<p>Long understood locally to be an important historical resource, the former lime operations area--30 acres just inside the main entrance to campus--last year was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the nation's official list of significant cultural resources worthy of preservation.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, the area includes the Granary, now a childcare center; the Cookhouse, now the Admissions office; several barns; the cooperage, where barrels for lime shipping were made; the ruins of former workers' cabins; the blacksmith shop; the Carriage House, now an office for University Relations, Arts &amp; Lectures, Special Events, and the Alumni Association; Cardiff House, now the Women's Center but formerly the residence of lime works owner Henry Cowell; and the lime kilns themselves.</p>
<p>"The campus would benefit from restoring the resources of the district as an attraction for prospective students, staff, and faculty," said David Subocz (Kresge '89), who sits on the board of the Friends group and is also chairman of the Santa Cruz Historic Preservation Commission. "But a more important benefit would be demonstrating to the community and UC system that it values historic preservation and is a responsible steward in a time of serious budget constraints."</p>
<p>The mission of Friends of Cowell Lime Works Historic District is to aid in documentation, restoration, preservation, and interpretation of the historic lime kilns and related structures and buildings of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District and other historic sites on campus. The group received formal recognition as a Friends organization in June.</p>
<p>As for projects, "we've got lots," said Perry. "We're having trouble trying to narrow it down and focus on just a few. The hay barn, cabins, and cooperage are all about to collapse. So we feel like we're scrambling to put out fires. But at the same time, we want to get going on some other things like tours to create more public interest to generate money."</p>
<p>With the formal recognition as a Friends group, people can make monetary donations. They can also make donations of materials or time, said Perry.</p>
<p>Volunteers already started dismantling a small storage shed that probably dates from the 1860s and will be putting that back together soon, he said.</p>
<p>"That's the kind of thing volunteers can help with," said Perry. "We hope eventually to have volunteers helping to clean up around the historic buildings and doing minor maintenance things, doing additional historic research, and, maybe in the future, helping lead tours."</p>
<p>The group has received $2,200 in donations, including big gifts from the Cabrillo Civic Club, which is dedicated to the civic progress of Californians of Portuguese descent.</p>
<p>"A lot of the guys who lived in the cabins were Portuguese," said Perry. "So the club has an interest in seeing the buildings restored."</p>
<p>However, Perry estimated the Friends would need several hundred thousand dollars to restore the buildings as the members would like.</p>
<p>But for the group, working on the project is a labor of love.</p>
<p>"It's one thing to read about history. That's important," said Perry. "But it's something else to be able to go out and see and touch and smell history. I want people to be able to do that 50 or 100 years from now."</p>

She will receive the award and deliver an address at Princeton during Alumni Day activities on Saturday, February 21.</p><p>Max is internationally known for her study of plasma physics, astronomy and astronomical instrumentation, and especially for her work in adaptive optics. She is director of the Center for Adaptive Optics, which is funded by the National Science Foundation and headquartered at UCSC. Her current research in astronomy involves the use of adaptive optics to study merging black holes at the centers of galaxies.</p><p>A pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, she created technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as clearly as if they were in space. As a coinventor of the laser guide star technique for astronomical adaptive optics, she has helped revolutionize the capabilities of ground-based telescopes.</p><p>"Claire has developed the techniques that let us see planets, quasars and galaxies with remarkable clarity," said David Spergel, the Charles A. Young Professor of Astronomy and chair of the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton. "This system enables the Keck Telescopes (in Hawaii), the world's largest, to make clearer images of objects ranging from planets to distant galaxies. Claire's work is essential not only for the current generation of great telescopes but is a key element in the next generation."</p><p>Max is the first woman to receive the Madison Medal. She arrived at Princeton to earn her Ph.D. after receiving her bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College in 1968. Early in her career, she studied the plasma physics aspects of laser fusion at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where she made important contributions to laser-plasma interactions and to the understanding of astrophysical plasmas. </p><p>In spring 2008, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors that can be accorded to a scientist or engineer. </p><p>The Madison Medal is named for the fourth president of the United States and the person many consider Princeton's first graduate student. Established by the Association of Princeton Graduate Alumni, it is presented each year to an alumnus or alumna of the Graduate School who has had a distinguished career, advanced the cause of graduate education, or achieved an outstanding record of public service.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158aa978072704601a012ffd594af11"><name>2550</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC earns top ranking for scientific impact of astronomy research</title><summary>UCSC is the top-ranking university in the country for the quality of its research in astronomy and astrophysics, according to a new analysis of papers published in scientific journals and how often those papers are cited by other scientists.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu  </author><keywords>astronomy, citations, ranking</keywords><description>UCSC is the top-ranking university in the country for the quality of its research in astronomy and astrophysics, according to a new analysis of papers published in scientific journals and how often those papers are cited by other scientists.</description><start-date>1226732400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC earns top ranking...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2550</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2550</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338761312</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338761312</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/11/images/hamilton.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/11/images/hamilton.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hamilton.jpg</name><file-size>14393</file-size><width>300</width><height>194</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lick Observatory on Mt.

Anne Kinney, former director of NASA's Astrophysics Division and currently director of the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said she undertook the study to help prospective graduate students evaluate departments that offer graduate degrees in astronomy. Kinney reported her findings in a paper, "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0311">The Science Impact of Astronomy Ph.D. Granting Departments in the United States</a>," which is posted on the Astro-ph web site.</p><p>"It's nice to get this kind of recognition, but this is more than just a trophy for the cabinet," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research. "Competition for the best graduate students is fierce, and we compete against the very best institutions in the world. The graduate students we accept for admission to our astronomy program are typically also accepted at Harvard and Princeton, so it's important to be able to show that the quality and impact of our research is first-rate."</p><p>Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said she was delighted but not surprised by the study's findings. "It's wonderful to have us validated in this way, but we know our program is one of the top few in the nation," she said. "The challenge for us is to bring the perception more in line with the reality. We're known to be good, but most people don't think of us as the top institution."</p><p>Kinney calculated an "impact index" for each university based on how often the astronomy publications of its faculty are cited by other researchers. When researchers publish a scientific paper, they cite previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work. The average number of citations per paper is regarded by many as an objective measure of the scientific impact of individuals, departments, or institutions.</p><p>One approach Kinney used in the study included astronomy and astrophysics publications by all authors at a given institution, regardless of whether they are affiliated with the department that grants astronomy degrees. By this measure, UCSC ranks first, followed by Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and Pennsylvania State Universities. At UCSC, this approach would include work by astrophysicists and cosmologists in the Department of Physics, planetary scientists in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, solar physics researchers in the Department of Applied Math and Statistics, researchers developing new technology for astronomy in the Center for Adaptive Optics, and other researchers not affiliated with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics (or who did not list that affiliation on their published papers).</p><p>Another approach focused only on the publications by faculty within the degree-granting department, which at UCSC is the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. By this measure, UCSC is second only to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), with Princeton and Harvard Universities in third and fourth place. </p><p>Kinney also looked at the total number of articles published in the 10-year period covered in the analysis (1993 through 2002). UCSC was one of only three universities that had both an impact index in the top quartile and more than 1,000 publications in a decade. The others are Princeton and Johns Hopkins.</p><p>"These three universities stand out as hitting the trifecta of high department quality, high overall quality, and high volume of publications," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics. </p><p>UCSC's astronomy program benefits from its close ties to the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), which has its headquarters at UCSC. "This ranking reflects not only the excellence of our academic program, but also on the world-class laboratories for astronomical instrumentation we have here that have provided the tools for carrying out groundbreaking research," said Michael Bolte, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of UCO/Lick. </p><p>Kinney noted that the publications included in her analysis did not account for all of an institution's publications in the field of astronomy, because she only looked at a selected group of journals. </p><p>"The way that I collected the publications, by pre-selecting for astronomy/astrophysics journals, means that it is very much an apples to apples comparison," she said. "When you look at a uniform set of journals, you remove all differences related to the journals and really do look at the impact of the articles themselves."</p><p>But that also means the figures for the total number of publications from each institution do not represent a complete count of astronomy-related papers. For example, astronomy papers published in general science journals such as Science and Nature were not included because there is no easy way to extract them from the databases. Kinney said she suspects that including those papers would only accentuate the differences between the top-ranking and lower-ranking institutions.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158ac248072704601a012ff9f64337d"><name>2551</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC President Yudof provides update on retirement plan</title><summary>President Yudof writes about the UC Retirement Plan.</summary><description>President Yudof writes about the UC Retirement Plan.</description><start-date>1226300400000</start-date><display-name>UC President Yudof provides...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2551</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2551</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338761682</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338761682</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Colleagues:</p><p>I write to bring you up to date on the UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) and pension benefits for both active UC employees not yet drawing benefit payments and past employees or surviving spouses currently receiving benefits from UCRP.</p><p>Media reports of recent weeks have discussed the impact of the recent stock market declines on defined benefit retirement plans, such as the UC Retirement Plan and CalPERS.  The historic volatility of and significant declines in the financial markets are a concern for all of us, since investment performance affects a pension plans funded status significantly.  Specifically, as of October 31, 2008, the UCRP investment portfolio has experienced an estimated decline of approximately 24 percent for the current fiscal year, and an overall decline of 28.3 percent since June 30, 2007.  As of June 30, 2007, UCRP was estimated to be nearly 105 percent funded, compared to 103 percent on June 30, 2008, and as of October 8, 2008, UCRPs funded status was estimated to be approximately 100 percent.</p><p>Although the current situation is disconcerting to both active employees and benefit recipients alike, I want to assure you that your UCRP benefits are secure and to remind you that UCRP investments are well diversified.  The Plan's investment portfolio is distributed between stocks, fixed-income investments, alternative invest-ments and cash, which helps ensure that the overall portfolio can weather bad per-formance patches in any one investment area.  It's also important to remember that investment performance will rise and fall over time, and that one must view the markets with a long-term perspective.  For example, before 2007-2008, UCRP had posted positive investment returns for five consecutive years (2003-2007) and for 16 of the previous 20 years (1988-2007).  These factors are easily overlooked during short periods of financial concern.</p><p>The immediate situation only underscores, however, that for the long-term financial health of UCRP, contributions must resume in 2009, both from employees and from the University.  As part of the restart, we will continue to stress to the State, even in the face of its own funding difficulties, that it must honor its traditional obligation of helping fund contributions to UCRP, just as the State has continued to do for years for CalPERS.</p><p>UCRP has had an extraordinary record of management by the UC Board of Regents for nearly the past half-century.  This achievement is particularly impressive in light of the fact that, as a result of an unprecedented 18-year contribution holiday, nearly 80 percent of the current UC workforce has not contributed a single dollar to their individual UCRP accounts from which their future guaranteed benefit payments will be drawn.  At the same time it is clear there are many long-term challenges regarding UCRP, and it is critical that we continue to evaluate options for achieving two equally important goals: keeping the Plan financially sound and offering retirement benefits that help us to attract and retain the caliber of personnel needed to maintain UC's quality and competitiveness.  This type of evaluation will necessarily span many months, include an analysis of UCRP membership trends and actuarial assumptions, and require extensive consultation with members of the University community, including the Academic Council, the campuses and medical centers, emeriti and retirees, and our union colleagues.</p><p>The Board of Regents Committee on Investments will receive the 2007-2008 UCRP annual report at its November 18-20 meeting </p><p>(<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/meetings.html">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/meetings.html</a>).  Those interested can listen to the Board discussion via the Webcast or review the report online after the meeting at: <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/forms_pubs/categorical/annual_reports.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/forms_pubs/categorical/annual_reports.html</a>.

I will work closely with The Regents, the Chancellors, the members of the Academic Council, the UC Retirement Advisory Board, and other members of the University community to ensure that any decisions about UCRP support the goal of preserving good benefits and the Plan's long-term financial health.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Mark G.

<p>Each of us needs to be able to recognize the signs of these schemes and know what to do to avoid them. A safe rule to follow is never to give out personal or sensitive information to anyone you don't know or who doesn't have a legitimate need for it. It is also important to use secure passwords to protect your computer and your accounts, and to keep your passwords secret. Passwords are often the first line of defense against hackers.</p>
<p>Please see the National Cyber Security Awareness Month article in this month's online UCSC News &amp; Events at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2441">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2441</a> for some practical dos and don'ts to help you avoid these schemes and protect both your own privacy and the university. By taking active precautions such as those suggested above and in the article, you will help reduce the risk to yourself and other members of the UCSC community from computer security breaches and the costly and time-consuming consequences of identity theft.</p>

Photo by J. P. Zehr.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An unusual microorganism discovered in the open ocean may force scientists to rethink their understanding of how carbon and nitrogen cycle through ocean ecosystems. A research team led by Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, characterized the new microbe by analyzing its genetic material, even though researchers have not been able to grow it in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Zehr said the newly described organism seems to be an atypical member of the cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic bacteria formerly known as blue-green algae. Unlike all other known free-living cyanobacteria, this one lacks some of the genes needed to carry out photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light energy to make sugars out of carbon dioxide and water. The mysterious microbe can do something very important, though: It provides natural fertilizer to the oceans by "fixing" nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form useable by other organisms.</p>
<p>"For it to have such an unusual metabolism is very exciting," Zehr said. "We're trying to understand how something like this can live and grow with so many missing parts."</p>
<p>A paper describing the new findings appears in the November 14 issue of the journal <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Earlier research by Zehr's group had revealed surprisingly large numbers of novel nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, including the one that is the focus of this study, in the open ocean. Although 80 percent of Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen, most organisms cannot use it unless it is "fixed" in combination with other elements to make compounds like ammonia and nitrate. Because nitrogen is essential for all forms of life, nitrogen fixation is a major factor controlling overall biological productivity in the oceans.</p>
<p>The new microbe is one of the most abundant nitrogen fixers in many parts of the ocean, Zehr said. New DNA sequencing technology provided by 454 Life Sciences enabled rapid sequencing of the organism's genome. The results showed that it is missing the entire set of genes needed for photosystem II and carbon fixation, essential parts of the molecular machinery that carries out photosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>"That has multiple implications," Zehr said. "It must have a 'lifestyle' that's very different from other cyanobacteria. Ecologically, it's important to understand its role in the ecosystem and how it affects the balance of carbon and nitrogen in the ocean."</p>
<p>During photosynthesis, photosystem II generates oxygen by splitting water molecules. Because oxygen inhibits nitrogen fixation, most nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria only fix nitrogen at night, or do it in specialized cells. The lack of photosystem II enables the new microbe to fix nitrogen during the day, Zehr said.</p>
<p>But without photosynthesis, it can't take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into sugars. So it's not clear how the new microbe feeds itself. Either it has some way of feeding on organic matter in its environment, or it lives in close association with other organisms that provide it with food, Zehr said.</p>
<p>"It would make a perfect symbiont because it could feed nitrogen to its host and live on the carbon provided by the host," he said.</p>
<p>Zehr's team was able to obtain a mostly pure sample of these unique cyanobacteria using a flow cytometer--a device that rapidly sorts individual cells based on size and color. The flow cytometer can take the cell soup from an ocean sample, classify each cell as it passes through laser beams, and sort different cell types into separate containers. A cell type that makes up a small percentage of the original sample can be concentrated to nearly pure levels using flow cytometry.</p>
<p>The team harvested DNA from the concentrated sample of cyanobacteria and sequenced it using the Genome Sequencer FLX system from 454 Life Sciences. The company's new sequencing reagents and software produce extra-long "reads" of DNA, greatly increasing the speed of the sequencing process.</p>
<p>"We were able to gain early access to this new high-throughput technology for rapid sequencing of the microbe's genome," Zehr said. "I had begun to suspect that there was something missing in this organism's genome, and the genome sequencing confirmed that."</p>
<p>Photosystem II is a large complex of multiple proteins and chlorophyll molecules, but the team was unable to find any of the genes for the photosystem II core proteins. The genes for photosystem I appeared in the sequencing data, as did genes for both photosystems from the small numbers of contaminating cyanobacteria in the sample.</p>
<p>Zehr said he plans to continue his research on the new microbe and fill some gaps in the present knowledge. Efforts are currently under way to map the microbe's presence in the oceans and determine its global abundance. Zehr is also interested in how its metabolism differs from other known cyanobacteria. If it can be cultured, there may be ways to exploit this organism's unusual metabolism in biotechnology applications, he said.</p>
<p>Zehr's coauthors on the paper include graduate student Shelley Bench, researcher Brandon Carter, and postdoctoral scholars Ian Hewson, Tuo Shi, and James Tripp of UCSC, as well as Faheem Niazi and Jason P. Affourtit of 454 Life Sciences. This work was supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the NSF Center for Microbial Oceanography Research and Education, and sequencing was provided by 454 Life Sciences.</p>

Arnold Schwarzenegger, will force UC Santa Cruz to make even more reductions in operations than it already had planned after lawmakers slashed spending for UC in the initial state budget, according to Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger.</p>
<p>Kliger, speaking at Wednesday's Fall Academic Senate meeting, addressed declining state support for UC and the impact it will have on UCSC.</p>
<p>"This will be the first of many discussions we will have this year on the budget," Kliger said.</p>
<p>Last week, the governor proposed mid-year cuts in the state budget including an additional $65.5 million from UC in the current fiscal year. That would be on top of the $48 million cut to UC included in the final 2008-09 budget. The university also needed to achieve an additional $100 million in savings to cover student enrollment growth and increases in fixed costs not funded by the state.</p>
<p>The state's per-student spending for education at UC, adjusted for inflation and enrollment growth, has fallen nearly 40 percent since 1990, according to UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>In July, Kliger put in place a $4.5 million budget reduction at UCSC.</p>
<p>Now, he said, we "face mid-year cuts that, once adopted by the Legislature and imposed by the governor, will leave us needing to implement further reductions."</p>
<p>The anticipated cuts "mean that we will put at risk not only the quality of our institution, but the basic access to the citizens of California."</p>
<p>Kliger does not yet know the full extent for the campus of the impending mid-year cuts, but said that budget reductions could be significant and last for several years.</p>
<p>His office is doing the following to deal with the anticipated cuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talking with vice chancellors, deans, vice provosts, and the Academic Senate about strategies.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Exploring every opportunity to further increase efficiencies.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Considering deferring actions on new initiatives.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Proposing to the Senate that the campus limit the enrollment of new frosh to about 3,500 students--about 400 fewer than in the current year. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Considering limiting the recruitment of new faculty to essential hires. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Limiting growth in student services, and working with the Student Fee Advisory Committee to consider every possible programmatic efficiency.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Looking at every program and/or activity to determine what can be cut.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Directing principal officers to implement all reasonable cost-saving measures and to engage their staffs in identifying ways to invest limited resources as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UCSC plans to embark on a comprehensive fundraising campaign, said Chancellor George Blumenthal, in his opening remarks to the audience.</p>
<p>The campus needs to bring in new resources to supplement state and federal funds, increase its capacity to do more and better research and educate students, and increase its impact and prestige, he said.</p>
<p>"Financial challenges aside, we must--and will--be guided by our vision to be the leading institution for educating students and a top-ranked research university," said Blumenthal.</p>

On Saturday morning, November 8, at approximately 7 a.m., Maria (Blanca) Frausto died in an automobile accident while on her way to bury her recently deceased mother in Mazatlan, Mexico. Her father, also in the car, died as well.</p>
<p>Maria Frausto began her food service career at the University on September 16, 1990. Called Blanca by her friends and coworkers, she was a truly "force" within the Porter Dining Hall, where she was a cook for many years. Many people looked up to and admired her for her hard work and dedication as well for her outgoing personality and great sense of humor. In her 18 years with Dining Blanca was a true leader in the kitchen: she successfully trained many new employees, was very popular with students, and is deservedly famous for her special handmade tamales, served at many College Nights and other campus functions.</p>
<p>She is survived by her son and her husband Manuel Avila, who also works for Porter Dining Hall as a Senior Cook. An informal and spontaneous memorial, attended by 40-45 coworkers and campus friends, was held on the Porter Dining Hall patio on Monday afternoon. No further memorial or service is planned at this time. UCSC Dining will announce future memorial plans as they arise.</p>

<p>En Memoriam</p>
<p>UCSC Dining arrepentido anuncia la pÃ©rdida trÃ¡gica de uno de empleados de largo plazo y altamente valorados. En la maÃ±ana de sÃ¡bado aproximadamente a las 7 a.m. Maria (Blanca) Frausto muriÃ³ en un accidente de automÃ³vil mientras que ella estaba en el camino de enterrar a su madre recientemente difunta en Mazatlan, MÃ©xico. Su padre, tambiÃ©n en el coche, muriÃ³ tambiÃ©n.</p>
<p>Maria Frausto comenzÃ³ su carrera del servicio de alimento en la universidad el 16 de septiembre de 1990. Conocida por Blanca de sus amigos y compaÃ±eros de trabajo, ella era verdad una "fuerza" dentro del comedor del Porter, donde ella trabajÃ³ como cocinera durante muchos aÃ±os. Mucha gente pensÃ³ en ella con mucho respeto y la admiraban para su trabajo duro y esmero para su personalidad saliente y gran sentido del humor. En sus 18 aÃ±os con Dining Blanca era un lÃ­der verdadero en la cocina: ella entrenÃ³ con Ã©xito a muchos nuevos empleados, era muy popular entre los estudiantes, y es merecidamente famosa por sus tamales especiales hechos a mano, que se han servido en muchas College Nights y otras funciones del campo.</p>
<p>Ella es sobreviviÃ³ por su hijo y por su marido Manuel Ã&#129;vila que tambiÃ©n trabaja para el comedor de Porter como Senior Cook. Una conmemoraciÃ³n informal y espontÃ¡neo, atendido por 40-45 compaÃ±eros de trabajo y amigos del campo, fue sostenido en el patio del comedor de Porter en la tarde del lunes pasado. En este tiempo, no hay otra conmemoraciÃ³n ni servicio planeado. UCSC Dining anunciarÃ¡ planes conmemorativos como se presentan.</p>

John Pearse, a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, and his wife, Vicki, a research associate at the Institute of Marine Sciences, are both experts on marine invertebrates. </p><p>The Lifetime Achievement Award was established in 2005 to honor an outstanding scientist who has been involved in the Western Society of Naturalists (WSN) throughout his or her career and has made an exemplary life-long contribution to increasing our understanding of natural history. The Pearses were honored at the annual WSN meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, earlier this month. </p><p>Both have long been active leaders in WSN and other scientific societies. John served as president of WSN, California Academy of Sciences, International Society of Invertebrate Reproduction, and Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. Vicki has served as president of the American Microscopical Society and editor of the journal <i>Invertebrate Biology</i>. </p><p>The Pearses are passionate about marine invertebrates and have shared their enthusiasm with a multitude of students and colleagues. John's research has spanned reproductive biology and the ecology of kelp forests and the rocky intertidal zone. The two have worked separately and as a team, and although their studies have focused mostly on the California coast, they have ranged from tropical to Antarctic waters. </p><p>The Pearses are coeditors, with Arthur Giese, of the 9-volume treatise <i>Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates</i>. They also coauthored, with Vicki's parents, Ralph and Mildred Buchsbaum, the textbook <i>Living Invertebrates</i> (an expanded version of <i>Animals Without Backbones</i>).</p><p>John and Vicki Pearse are both fellows of the California Academy of Sciences. John is also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and has received numerous awards and honors during his career, including several teaching awards from UCSC and the American University of Cairo, Egypt, where he taught before coming to UCSC in 1971.

<p>The award was given by the Fellows with the Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability (HCFS), which provides thought leadership and counsel on sustainable design efforts and innovation for the food service industry.</p>
<p>Scott Berlin, UCSC's director of hospitality and dining, was named an HCFS Fellow. James Smith, chef de cuisine for UCSC, accepted the grant on Berlin's behalf.</p>
<p>UCSC was judged as having the best sustainability program from among numerous entrants nationwide, which included educational institutions, food service establishments, and hospitality facilities.</p>
<p>"This recognition by the HCFS provides additional validation for the programs we have implemented as part of our sustainability efforts," said Berlin, who will help select future operations for grant recognition while serving as an HCFS Fellow. "We look forward to sharing our success stories as well as to continuing to develop additional sustainability programs that can flourish in part because of this grant award."</p>
<p>UCSC "is not only implementing sustainability efforts that shine as best-practice examples, but their innovative approach also demonstrates attention to detail in all aspects of sustainability and is proving to have a significant return on investment," said Rick Cartwright, vice president and general manager of retail systems for ITW Food Equipment Group and an HCFS Fellow.</p>
<p>Overall, UC Santa Cruz decreased energy consumption and water use, reduced solid waste and water waste, and implemented a Farm-to-Fork program. To conserve energy, UCSC's Dining Services department teamed up with PG&amp;E to replace incandescent lighting, exit signs, and older-style T12 ballasts (long fluorescent light bulb holders) with more energy-efficient alternatives. As a result, the campus saved nearly $10,000 annually. For its efforts, UCSC also received a $26,500 rebate from PG&amp;E that will fund future sustainable Dining Services projects.</p>
<p>The campus updated its purchasing practices to mandate that only Energy Star-qualified equipment be purchased. Dining Services now uses 56 Energy Star-rated appliances that have cut most energy costs in half. In addition, Dining Services launched its "Trayless Tuesday" campaign, in which trays were removed from one of the campus's five dining halls. This measure alone reduced food waste by 32 percent. By fall 2008, UCSC eliminated all trays in an effort to save an estimated 30,000 gallons of water each month as well as save on cleaning chemicals and water heating costs.</p>
<p>In order to reduce waste, the campus implemented a pilot composting program in which kitchen scraps are collected from four of its five dining halls and transported to the Vision Recycling composting project at Buena Vista Landfill in Watsonville. Since July 1, Dining Services has diverted 28 tons of food scraps from the landfill, according to Candy Berlin, program coordinator for Dining Services.</p>
<p>In conjunction, Dining Services uses compostable paper products and flatware made from corn, which are 100 percent biodegradable and compostable. The university also finds productive uses for food instead of throwing it away. Vegetable and meat scraps are used for soup stock, and grease, fat, and unused cooking oils are recycled for other purposes, such as biodiesel fuel. Other perishable food is donated to a local food bank. When food must be thrown away, it is converted to slurry via a pulper. Using pulpers, UC Santa Cruz has reduced cubic yards of waste collection in dumpsters by two-thirds. The university has also eliminated five gallons of grease a day from entering the wastewater system by using a bucket to dispose of grease instead of rinsing it down the drain.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz purchases $6.9 million in food supplies yearly. By buying locally whenever possible, Dining Services keeps revenue in the local economy. It also provides for fresher, higher-quality vine-ripened produce and reduces the campus's carbon footprint. Aside from purchasing produce and crops from local farmers, the campus also runs its own farm. The UC Santa Cruz Farm supplies dining services with organically grown produce. Buying from its own farm eliminates the need to transport produce to campus and keeps revenue in our own economy and thus supports the research and education of sustainable farming practices.</p>
<p>UCSC has several additional sustainable programs in the works, including using reusable containers for all to-go meals served and installing solar-powered trash compactors. Dining Services is also investigating more vegetarian-based menu items.</p>

He was one of three UC chancellors to discuss the impacts of budget cuts. His remarks are as follows.) </p><p></p><p>Thank you, Provost Grey. </p><p>The excellence of the University, with its commitment to access and diversity are critical to the economic and intellectual well being of California.</p><p>I am deeply concerned about the budget situation we face.  The anticipated cuts, exacerbated by increasing mandatory costs, mean that both the quality of our institution as well as basic access and affordability to the citizens of California are at risk.</p><p>For UC Santa Cruz, we will have no choice in this next round of budget cuts but to cut deeply into our academic programs; and this raises the specter that the progress we've made as a campus will be arrested (and perhaps even reversed) and that cuts to academic programs will erode the quality of a UCSC education.</p><p>Let me provide some context about UCSC's choices. The campus is heavily dependent on State funding and student fees to pay for our core instructional programs.</p><p>While we have significantly increased our contracts and grants and our private giving, these funds are generally restricted -- as President Yudof noted in his white paper on UC funding for the Regents' recent retreat.  </p><p>We have worked over the past few years to be more efficient.  We have consolidated and automated our business functions -- as well as our IT functions.  </p><p>As a result, we were able to take a focused and nuanced approach to accommodating the 2008-09 budget cuts.  We did not make across-the-board reductions. Rather, we have -- to the extent possible -- accommodated the priorities of our Strategic Academic Plan.</p><p>Academic units were cut, on average, by less than 1 percent -- recognizing the fact that enrollments grew, but we received no state funds to support these students. </p><p>Critical functions such as health and safety were exempted from cuts -- although these units still had to deal with de facto cuts given workload and inflationary costs.</p><p>Since the campus is preparing for its first comprehensive fundraising campaign, we also protected our development efforts.</p><p>In contrast, administrative units were cut by as much as 10 percent, effectively shifting much of the burden associated with these cuts to our academic support units.  This strategy cannot be sustained.  These units now operate on very thin margins -- if someone is sick, the work simply doesn't get done; support for business transactions that require human interaction has been cut back significantly; increases in maintenance backlogs are accelerating.</p><p>While we will continue to focus on improving administrative efficiencies, we are approaching the point of diminishing returns -- some of our essential units cannot be further reduced.  For example, although we are half the size of our sister campus at Los Angeles, we cannot get by with half a chancellor.</p><p>We took our share of the $33.1 million of mid-year cuts on a one-time basis.  While this "gets us through," it simply delays the impact until 2009-10, when we must absorb these cuts and further mid-year cuts on a permanent basis.</p><p>So, as part of our multi-year strategic planning, we have already invested to streamline our administrative operations, made difficult (and principled) decisions on how to distribute the budget reductions to date -- and are striving to sustain our progress as a campus in building the academic programs that will define our future, and to honor our commitments to provide access.</p><p>What are our options for further cuts?</p><p>This year we will serve almost 600 students for which we have not received State funding. We will need to explore the impact of further cuts on future enrollment as well as future faculty recruitments. And, we will need to leave more positions unfilled</p><p>We have delayed new academic programs for which we have already received approval (e.g., PhDs in Visual Studies and in Film and Digital Media) and have already suspended initiatives in which we cannot afford to make further investment (e.g., Institute for Science and Global Policy).</p><p>We are considering how we will accommodate further reductions in our State support --Provost Kliger and I have engaged our leadership team -- our deans, our vice chancellors, our vice provosts, and our Academic Senate -- to explore how we might design a stable, sustainable campus on a smaller State budget. This requires understanding our core functions and the level of support they require, identifying additional programs and services that might be consolidated, and identifying additional programs we can eliminate.</p><p>Additional cuts will likely</p><p>.	First, involve reductions to our academic programs and hence instruction. This will be fundamentally inefficient in that it will affect our students' ability to make timely progress toward their degrees;</p><p>.	Second, it will involve reductions in access-which will be unfortunate because California now, more than ever, needs higher education to help provide its population with the skills to address 21st century problems and to fuel its economy; and</p><p>.	Third, it will involve further reductions in campus employment. Despite our progress in deploying technology to streamline our business processes, we still invest 86 percent of our State and student-fee funding in salaries and benefits.</p><p>Further reductions will not only affect our future plans, we anticipate that they will cut into the core of our existing academic programs -- those that have been responsible for fueling our campus's progress, our "upward trajectory" of excellence about which I often speak.</p><p>As a result of further reductions, our students will find that</p><p>.	First, it is more difficult to get into classes and there will be more limited opportunities to participate directly in the research experience with faculty and graduate students;</p><p>.	Second, there will be reduction in student academic support services, such as the writing center, library, etc, and more limited opportunities for enriching the college experience  -- the living and learning experience that characterizes Santa Cruz; and,</p><p>.	We may even lose some of our faculty-and thus the foundation for the very progress we have labored to sustain.</p><p>In summary, we recognize that the current economic conditions will persist for some time and that our campus must adjust to this new reality, at least in the near-term.</p><p>Our campus will continue to act deliberately and in a principled manner-looking to our strategic academic plan to provide us with the context within which we can set priorities, make difficult choices, and select among the opportunities available to us.</p><p>As I noted at the outset, I am concerned that with further budget reductions (compounded by increased mandatory costs) we will experience an erosion of both the quality of our institution and basic access to the citizens of California-something from which it may take years to recover.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158c6918072704601a012ffb48996ae"><name>2568</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor comments at Regents meeting on proposed state funding cuts to UC</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal and two other UC chancellors briefed the UC Board of Regents at its meeting in San Francisco today on the implications of reduced funding for their campuses.</summary><keywords>UC Board of Regents, mid-year cuts, Blumenthal</keywords><description>Chancellor Blumenthal and two other UC chancellors briefed the UC Board of Regents at its meeting in San Francisco today on the implications of reduced funding for their campuses.</description><start-date>1227078000000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor comments at Regents...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2568</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2568</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338768464</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338768464</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Chancellor Blumenthal and two other UC chancellors briefed the UC Board of Regents at its meeting in San Francisco today on the implications of reduced funding for their campuses.

The award is the division's highest honor, recognizing faculty excellence in research, teaching, and service. </p><p>Lin is renowned for his research in astrophysics, which has focused on understanding the formation and evolution of stars and planets. He has made significant contributions to the physics of disks of matter orbiting around a central mass, such as Saturn's rings, spiral galaxy disks, and the accretion rings around black holes that power quasars. </p><p>In a statement announcing the award, Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences, said Lin is "one of the most influential astrophysicists working today" and "the leading theorist in the world in the area of planet formation."</p><p>Lin is regularly asked to summarize the field of planet formation, giving an average of one invited talk every six weeks. Last year he was appointed as the founding director of the new Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in Beijing, China. </p><p>Lin is regarded as an excellent professor by undergraduates and graduate students alike. "He is often described by his students as extremely knowledgeable, enthusiastic, well-organized, humorous and one who arouses in them a keen interest in the subject matter," Thorsett said. </p><p>Lin earned his B.S. from McGill University and his Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics from Cambridge University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1979. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158cce08072704601a012ff90760345"><name>2572</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Budget update from campus provost</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal on Wednesday addressed the potential impact of state budget cuts to UC campuses in remarks to the Board of Regents at its regularly scheduled meeting in San Francisco.

He was among three campus Chancellors (UCLA Chancellor Block and UCSD Chancellor Fox were the others) invited to do so.</p><p>Chancellor Blumenthal succinctly conveyed his concerns -- which I share -- that the budget situation we face will put at risk the quality of our institution as well as access for the citizens of California.</p><p>His verbatim remarks <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/text.asp?pid=2566">are available</a> on our campus website.  If you have not yet read them, I hope you'll do so. As our campus community continues to deal with significant fiscal uncertainties, a shared understanding of our challenges and how we are dealing with them is more critical than ever.</p><p>In remarks to the Academic Senate last week, I outlined steps we are taking to anticipate and strategically address the potential impacts of mid-year cuts. My remarks <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/communications/transcripts/11-12-08.senate.html">are posted</a> on our website. I invite and encourage you to review them, and also welcome your comments.</p><p>I believe there are three essential points to be made at this juncture:</p><p>    . The economic environment is unlikely to return to "normal" any time soon. Budget reductions could be significant and may endure for several years.</p><p>    . It is unreasonable, therefore, to expect in future years to receive state funding at levels we have come to expect.</p><p>    . Given this, we must ensure new funding sources that will enable us to pursue our core academic, research and service initiatives. That makes a comprehensive campaign for UCSC an essential priority.</p><p>These times require that we be extraordinarily efficient with resources; creative and entrepreneurial at all levels of academic and administrative operations; and focused on those educational, research and service pursuits that can have the greatest impact on students, our community and society.</p><p>I'll continue to be in touch as we learn more about anticipated mid-year cuts. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158ce778072704601a012ffdc0d0a53"><name>2573</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment ends November 25 at midnight</title><start-date>1227250800000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment ends November...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2573</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2573</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338770494</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338770494</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>You have until Tuesday, November 25, to visit the Open Enrollment website <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment</a> to make UC health and welfare benefit plan changes for 2009.

This year the campus will be closed from Wednesday, December 24, 2008 through Thursday, January 1, 2009, re-opening on Friday, January 2, 2009. The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p>
<p>During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.</p>
<p>If you are required to work all or part of this closure, you must receive approval from your unit head and Principal Officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their Principal Officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:mcmanusd@ucsc.edu">mcmanusd@ucsc.edu</a>, by campus mail to Deanna McManus, Physical Plant, Barn G, or by fax (9-5121), no later than Friday, December 12, 2008, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate SHR Partner, for time and payroll accounting purposes. Faculty are urged to announce the closure broadly, to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closure.</p>
<p>Finally, please take special notice of the fact that, this year during the closure, Physical Plant will perform major work on the high voltage electrical system, requiring a campus electrical shutdown from Saturday, December 27, 2008 at 8:00 am, through approximately 6:00 pm Monday, December 29, 2008. Units in facilities that will only have emergency power will not be granted exceptions on those days. Many of the campus buildings will not have electrical power for equipment, lighting, or heat &amp; ventilation. Additional information regarding this shutdown will be provided in a separate communication in early December.</p>
<p>If you have facilities-related questions or would like furthering information on campus closure exceptions, please contact Deanna McManus at 9-2238.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Ilse Kolbus, director of Physical Plant </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158d1488072704601a012ff6d82a013"><name>2575</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Social psychologist Tom Pettigrew was quoted in a &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; story about racial tolerance.</summary><description>Social psychologist Tom Pettigrew was quoted in a &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; story about racial tolerance.</description><start-date>1227250800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/11/2575</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/11/2575</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338771224</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338771224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Social psychologist and race-relations expert Tom Pettigrew was quoted in a <em><strong>New York Times</strong></em> story about racial tolerance, which research reveals can spread as quickly as prejudice and suspicion.

"And mostly there is very little analysis at the high school level of why that is, and how girls and women can protect and empower themselves."</p><p>"My class deals with the many gender, race, class, and sexuality interests in people's lives," Aptheker added. "There's a lot of theory available, but it's not often presented in an accessible way that high school students-or incoming university students-can understand."</p><p>Aptheker began her career at UCSC as the sole lecturer in the Women's Studies Department (now called Feminist Studies). She became the department's first ladder-rank faculty member in 1987 and was honored with the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.</p><p><i>Ms.</i> Magazine was founded in 1971 by Gloria Steinem and Letty Cottin Pogrebin.

And as discussions of Thanksgiving feasts reach a fever pitch, I look forward to spending my Thanksgiving at the zoo.</p><p>For the last four years, my husband and I have celebrated the holiday at Happy Hollow Zoo. It started in 2004, when the zoo hosted a special "Feast for the Beasts" event during which zoo animals received special holiday meals served in even more festive containers. (I think the jaguar enjoyed the box her turkey came in more than the dinner itself.)</p><p>As recent transplants from the East Coast, my husband and I were happy to be surrounded by beasts and zoo visitors, mostly fathers and small children banished from their home kitchens so Mom could cook dinner in peace. Last year, Happy Hollow discontinued the special holiday meals, but the zoo was still open, and we were there, joined by hundreds of others.</p><p>We began this tradition to avoid the lonely prospect of staring at one another across a vast dining room table, our extended families far away. But even now, settled as we are in San Jose with good friends and family, it just feels right to spend part of the day visiting with our extended zoo family before going home to our own Thanksgiving table.</p><p>And so I come to this: Although food is central to Thanksgiving, obsessing about the meal seems to me to divert attention away from the value of sitting down in community and pondering the many blessings of our lives.</p><p>Thanksgiving is, at its heart, about reflection, contemplation, and community, the very values espoused by Slow Food founder Carlo Petrini but so often ignored in our rush to make sure we adhere to the mandates of socially responsible and politically correct dining.</p><p>Thanksgiving as I have experienced it has always been first and foremost about family and friends. In some years, there were not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the menagerie of family, friends, friends of friends, roommates, neighbors, colleagues, and foreign-exchange students who showed up. In other years, the gathering was more intimate but no less festive.</p><p>The rituals of laughter, banter, and long-distance telephone calls from loved ones far away are with us each year, even as we miss those who cannot be with us and grieve the loss of those who will never be with us again.</p><p>Those who are absent are still with us in the stories we retell and the recipes that get passed down from generation to generation.</p><p>Thanksgiving is one day when we pause to give each other our undivided attention. Food may be the lure that brings us together, but it is not the main focus of the day.</p><p> </p><p> ----</p><p>Melissa Caldwell is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
