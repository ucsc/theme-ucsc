<p><strong>Enjoying the view</strong></p>
<p>One hundred thirty-six people answered the call of last issue's poll, which asked, "This summer has been a lovely one on campus. What is your favorite campus vista point?"</p>
<p>Two panoramic views tied for first place, each with 21 percent of the vote: The Pogonip overlook pullout on Coolidge Drive, and flying down the bike path through the Great Meadow.</p>
<p>A number of correspondents took advantage of the "Other" field to write in their votes. Readers praised views from Stevenson College, College Ten, Oakes College, and Porter Meadow. A few of the responses were ones we hadn't thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>View from the cliffs at Long Marine Lab overlooking the Pacific <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The ARC courtyard <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The Arboretum Aussie picnic area toward inner UCSC <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The new 4th floor outside porches in McHenry <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>COLLEGE TEN! <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>View from the Flying IUD <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The bend in Porter Meadow</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>And what would a university environment be without its contrarian or challenge-the-establishment viewpoints? We also received some answers such as this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you joking? It's one big construction site!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>We enjoyed discovering the nooks, crannies, and panoramic views from campus that are savored by the people who work here day in and day out.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in our poll.</p>

<p><strong><u>August 11-24, 2008</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Most support biomedical research</strong></p>
<p>A record number of responses flooded in to the poll in our last issue, which asked, "What is your opinion about using animals such as fruit flies and mice on campus for biomedical research?"</p>
<p>In all, we received 947 responses, dwarfing the previous highest response number of 387.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven percent of respondents (538) said they support such research; 34 percent (320) were opposed to it; another 6 percent (53) either weren't sure or had no opinion; and 4 percent (36) had some other perspective.</p>
<p>Many people wrote in thoughtful comments on the topic. Some excerpts from the comments (lightly edited for spelling and grammar):</p>

<ul>
<li>While I believe that animal research is sometimes necessary, we should emphasize alternatives whenever possible. If and when we do use animal testing, we should treat animals with a maximum of care.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Should we argue about mice and flies, or should we confront some more dangerous issues going on in Santa Cruz? Are you really more concerned about mice than the thousands of children living in debilitating poverty in Santa Cruz County? What about the people who sweep mice feces off the floor at poverty wages? The arrogance and disconnect from real world problems among college activists is very alienating for me.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>I am against all torture.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Would the world have seen a polio vaccine if Jonas Salk had not done "heinous" and "cruel" things to animals? How should we test new cancer and AIDS drugs: On humans with no clue of what will happen, or on animals, in a controlled environment, to first test their safety?<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>I believe that as humans we have the compassion and the power to treat all living beings with respect and equality. Unfortunately, the earth and all those who share it with us pay deeply for the advancement of the human race. While I cannot say that many lives have not been saved by sacrificing the lives of animals, I believe that we should not put ourselves and the human race above all else.</li>

<p><strong>Read all about it</strong></p>
<p>Last issue's poll asked, "What is your preferred source for UCSC news?" While 71 readers responded to the multiple-choice offerings, 13 people replied with their own answers using the "other" button.</p>
<p>Three readers wrote in <em>City on a Hill Press.</em> One mentioned the <em>San Jose Mercury News.</em> Others singled out the <em>Currents</em> RSS feed and the Public Information Office.</p>
<p>And then there's always the old-fashioned way of getting news, as one reader gamely pointed out: "Gossip."</p>
<p>For the full report, see the <a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/viewPoll.aspx?view=results&amp;id=776882">results page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>These are a few of my favorite things</strong></p>
<p>In response to last issue's poll asking, "What do you like best about the campus in the summer?," 40 of you eschewed the multiple-choice offerings and replied with your own answers.</p>
<p>Many of the responses shared a familiar theme: Wildlife. Twelve respondents said they loved watching the campus's resident animals come forward when the hustle and bustle of the academic year subsided. Fawns were the most popular wildlife sighting, but readers also mentioned deer, coyotes, and summer migratory birds.</p>
<p>Another dominant theme was parking. Seven notes said more, easier, better parking was the best thing about summer.</p>
<p>Others said they appreciated the slower pace, the decreased traffic because of fewer students on campus, as well as more room on shuttles.</p>
<p>And then there were these responses:</p>
<p>"I just like to see change"</p>
<p>"The morning fog"</p>
<p>"SURFING!!"</p>
<p>"Everything!"</p>
<p>Thanks for taking part in our poll. Happy summer to all.</p>

<p><strong>Article caught the feeling of inauguration</strong></p>
<p>Just finished reading your wonderful article on <a href="%20http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2271">Chancellor Blumenthal's inauguration</a> in the online campus newspaper. You really hit the nail on the head by portraying the exact feeling we experienced on Friday. I was sorry that more of my coworkers did not attend--they missed a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading the article and reliving this special event through your eyes. I will print a copy to laminate and keep it with my program and ticket as souvenirs from that very special event.</p>

<p><strong>Water polo program cut</strong></p>
<p>On May 30, the powers that be at UCSC decided to cut the entire water polo program without prior notice given to any students or coaches who will be detrimentally affected by this decision.</p>
<p>UCSC is the only Division III campus in the UC system. When team members volunteered to continue funding the program through fundraising and donations--which other UCSC teams such as women's rugby do--they were turned down. Instead, they were to furnish proof of $40,000 in pledges by June 4, giving them mere days to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>Water polo is not a "big" sport, but it is vitally important to those who love the sport and have chosen UCSC based on their ability to continue to play. Doesn't UCSC want to attract a variety of students, including those who love sportsmanship and team unity in the less popular sports? This decision was made after students would be able to commit to enrollment at different schools, where they would be given the chance to continue playing.</p>

<p><strong>Proud to be part of the military</strong></p>
<p>I am married to a United States Marine. We have three wonderful children, and we could not be any prouder to be part of the military life.</p>
<p>I recently read an article in our Military Times Report that stated the UCSC organization "Students Against War" protested military recruiters during a job fair on your campus (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2140">Vigorous dissent, job-seeking coexist at campus career fair</a>). I am extremely disappointed with the way the protest was handled, in which protesters shouted so loudly not even a recruiter could have a decent conversation with a possible future Marine or soldier.</p>
<p>This country is very lucky to have a strong military that continues to fight against terrorism and protect our freedoms. It is the choice of any adult whether or not to join the military. We do not criticize the careers of others--why, then, do they constantly stand in the way of allowing any person even just to speak with a recruiter? Without our troops and our recruiters, we would not have a defense team for our country, or a support system for other countries, or even be allowed to practice our everyday freedoms, including protesting. My husband joined the military as his career choice long ago, and now he continues to re-enlist to help protect our country, whether on our own soil or somewhere around the world.</p>
<p>"Students Against War" should try talking to the families of deployed service members. I am positive that this organization would get a response of how proud these families are to be American and serving their country.</p>

<p><strong>Campus lauded for outreach to newly admitted students</strong></p>
<p>The recent articles regarding the campus spring yield efforts were excellent! (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2116">Spring Spotlight offers a slice of Slug life</a>; <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2137">Chancellor receptions bring UCSC to prospective students</a>) The campus really reached out to admitted students this year and the responses we've received from families have been overwhelmingly positive. I hope readers of <em>Currents</em> know that they've made a meaningful difference for thousands of students, and coverage like those articles only underscores that fact.</p>

<p><strong>Article downplayed animal testing</strong></p>
<p>My name is Toni Longley, I go to UCSC and I read your article today (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1997">Breast-cancer researcher undeterred by protests</a>). I have really strong feelings about animal testing and was kind of upset by your article. I think you should have written that while people are not testing "products" on the animals in labs at UCSC, they are still conducting scientific research upon living non-human animals that is uncomfortable, invasive, and sometimes lethal, which I think you downplayed but should have at least included. Furthermore, you didn't include the viewpoint of anyone from the other side of the argument. I don't know exactly what the protesters did, and I don't know who they are, but I can understand and would be willing to explain where they are coming from, and for the record this is not a threat that I would invade anyone's home. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><strong>Machining class left out</strong></p>
<p>[Regarding the story, <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2030">UC Santa Cruz engineering students win national robotics competition</a>,] I was pleased to see that these students received recognition for their hard work and great achievement. Lots of hours went into the development of their climber. I was a bit disappointed that your article failed to mention anything about how these students completed a "Basic Machining" shop class to obtain the necessary machining skills needed to fabricate the mechanical portion of their project. I offer this three-week class twice a year to S.O.E. students to help them understand the basics of mechanical design and fabrication using shop tools and machinery.</p>

<p>Three of the students on this winning team--Bill Hogan, Kevin Hichborn, and Laurel DeMarco--completed my shop class in early February. They logged in 27 hours of shop use time while developing their project. These students were very creative, great to work with, and I'm sure they will go far in the future.</p>

<p>This marks the first season designed by Jeanette Pilak, who was named new director of the campus Arts &amp; Lectures program last October.</p>
<p>Pilak is a veteran of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts where she coordinated regional, national and international festivals. Her background also includes directing programming at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene, Oregon--where she managed an annual performance series and summer outdoor amphitheater.</p>
<p>"My goal is to bring the widest range of high-quality artistic performances to the community," said Pilak. "Looking at the new season, I was struck by the fact that the title of one of the shows-Maestros in Concert-could really be the name of the whole season, because each one of these performers is artistically superb in every way."</p>
<p>The season opens on October 4 with a concert at the UCSC Recital Hall by the acclaimed Shanghai Quartet, blending the delicacy of Eastern music with the emotional breadth of Western repertoire. Now celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Quartet will be presenting commissions from artists on three continents-composers Chen Yi (China), Krzysztof Penderecki (Poland), and jazz pianist Dick Hyman (USA).</p>
<p>Renowned NPR humorist and best-selling author David Sedaris brings his sardonic wit and incisive social critiques to the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium on October 26. Sedaris is the author of <em>Me Talk Pretty One Day</em> and <em>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</em>, and his essays can frequently be found in the <em>New Yorker</em> and <em>Esquire</em>.</p>
<p>His latest book, <em>When You Are Engulfed in Flames</em>, includes pieces on trying to make coffee when the water is shut off, having a lozenge fall from your mouth into the lap of a fellow passenger on a plane, and traveling to Japan in order to quit smoking.</p>
<p>Grammy-nominated Tiempo Libre comes to the Rio Theatre on March 5 with a seven-piece Latin band that mixes traditional Afro-Cuban beats with hip-hop, house, and jazz in a dance-inducing, musical style called timba. The first authentic all-Cuban timba band to perform in the United States, the Miami-based Tiempo Libre has reinvented traditional Cuban music with a youthful, modern, high-voltage sound.</p>
<p><em>Maestros in Concert</em> on April 10 features Pandit Shivkumar Sharma-one of India's most popular and revered classical musicians-in collaboration with virtuoso Zakir Hussain on tabla. Hussain has performed and recorded with a bevy of celebrated musicians including Mickey Hart, Ravi Shankar, Van Morrison, Tito Puente, and Pharoah Sanders.</p>
<p>One of the most unusual collaborations in the season will feature new acoustic masters Darol Anger and Mike Marshall joining forces with Sweden's most influential folk ensemble, VÃ¤sen, on April 2. Bridging the gap between the fiddle and dance tunes of Appalachia and the nyckelharpa and polskas of Sweden, these musicians combine their talents to take "folk" music in an entirely new direction.</p>
<p>"We're working with artists who help us to advance a deeper understanding of global issues and cultures," Pilak noted. "By presenting these artists-along with outreach activities, residencies, and local school performances--we hope to engage the community to reflect about diversity in our society and around the world."</p>
<p>The season will also include an appearance by Ukrainian-born pianist Valentina Lisitsa, who wowed UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures audiences last year as the accompanist to violinist Hillary Hahn. Lisitsa returns on her own this year to perform selections from a vast repertoire that includes works ranging from Bach and Mozart, to Shostakovich and Bernstein.</p>
<p>On January 18, Interpreti Veneziani Baroque Orchestra recreates the atmosphere of an authentic Venetian concert experience at the UCSC Recital Hall. "At home in Venice, they perform in the same church in which Vivaldi himself loved to play," Pilak noted.</p>
<p>And Santa Cruz's own New Music Works celebrates its 30th anniversary with an imaginative program on January 23 that includes a New Zealander's adaptations of the Blues, a German-American's Middle Eastern rendezvous with an oud, and a Canadian's marriage of a Chinese zither and a harpsichord.</p>
<p>The 2008-09 season will close on May 13 with a solo appearance by Garrison Keillor at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. Best known as the host of NPR's <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>, Keillor is the author of 12 books, including Lake <em>Wobegon Days</em> and <em>Love Me</em>, and also hosts the daily radio and online program, <em>The Writers Almanac</em>.</p>

<p>"There's such a huge demand for Garrison that we're thrilled he's coming to Santa Cruz," said Pilak. "It's his only stop on the Central Coast in 2009." She paused for a moment and reflected on the upcoming season.</p>
<p>"It's always amazing to me after long days in the office-when I hear that first note of music, that first sound of a voice, those first words on stage-I'm physically changed and I remember this is why I love this job."</p>

Image by M. Martick.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have discovered a type of gene regulation never before observed in mammals--a "ribozyme" that controls the activity of an important family of genes in several different species.</p>
<p>The findings, published July 9 in the journal <em>Nature</em>, describe a new and surprising role for the so-called hammerhead ribozyme, an unusual molecule previously associated with obscure virus-like plant pathogens called viroids. The UCSC researchers found the ribozyme embedded within certain genes in mice, rats, horses, platypuses, and several other mammals. The genes are involved in the immune response and bone metabolism.</p>
<p>"The unique thing about these ribozymes is that they control the expression of the genes they're embedded in," said Monika Martick, a UCSC postdoctoral researcher and first author of the <em>Nature</em> paper.</p>
<p>A ribozyme, or "RNA enzyme," is an RNA molecule that can catalyze a chemical reaction. RNA is better known for its ability to encode genetic information, while most biological reactions are carried out by enzymes made of protein. Scientists are discovering, however, that RNA is a remarkably versatile type of molecule.</p>
<p>"RNA can function in the biology of organisms in more ways than we tend to give it credit for," said coauthor Lucas Horan, a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>When a gene is activated or "expressed," its DNA sequence on the chromosome is transcribed into an RNA molecule called a messenger RNA. The messenger RNA sequence is then translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein molecule, and the protein then carries out the gene's function in the cell.</p>
<p>In the genes studied by Martick and Horan, the messenger RNA contains sequences that assemble to form an active hammerhead ribozyme. The hammerhead ribozyme is a self-cleaving molecule that essentially cuts itself in two. This self-cleaving action in the messenger RNAs effectively turns off the genes by preventing protein translation. Presumably, another mechanism exists to turn on the genes by stopping the self-cleaving action of the ribozyme.</p>
<p>"We don't know what the switch is to shut off the action of the ribozyme, but we assume there is one," Martick said.</p>
<p>She and her coauthors are all affiliated with UCSC's Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA, directed by Harry Noller, Sinsheimer professor of molecular biology. As a graduate student working with William Scott, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, Martick had <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=907">determined the three-dimensional structure of the hammerhead ribozyme</a>.</p>
<p>Scott and his research group have been working on the structure and mechanism of the hammerhead ribozyme since before his arrival at UCSC in 1998. "This is the most remarkable and unexpected discovery I have seen during that time," he said.</p>
<p>For the new study, Martick teamed up with Horan, a graduate student in Noller's lab. Scott and Noller are both coauthors of the <em>Nature</em> paper.</p>
<p>"Monika clued me in that she had found something interesting, and we decided to try to figure out what was going on," Horan said. "She had just finished her Ph.D., and I was working on something else, but we got some preliminary data and it turned out to be a very fruitful collaboration; it's the kind of interaction that the RNA Center is meant to stimulate."</p>
<p>Martick performed the initial searches that turned up the hammerhead ribozyme sequences in the mouse and rat genomes. Then she and Horan did more exhaustive searches of the genomic sequences of other organisms, using the UCSC Genome Browser and other databases. They found the ribozyme in related genes in the mouse, rat, horse, and platypus, and in unknown genes in five other mammals.</p>
<p>"We used to think the hammerhead ribozyme was restricted to obscure plant viruses, but it now looks like it is featured much more prominently in mammalian biological systems," Scott said.</p>
<p>Laboratory experiments showed that the messenger RNAs containing the embedded sequences form an active ribozyme and that the ribozyme decreases gene activity in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>"This mode of gene regulation hadn't been seen before in mammals," Horan said. "Because it occurs in such a wide variety of organisms, including the platypus, it must have been around since the early mammalian ancestors."</p>
<p>The researchers did not find the ribozyme sequence in the corresponding human genes, however, suggesting that a different mechanism regulates those genes in humans.</p>
<p>"These genes are involved in the immune response and in bone metabolism, so they are being intensively studied on two fronts," Martick said. "It's important to understand how that system is regulated and if the rodent system is regulated differently from the human system."</p>
<p>This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.</p>

(Photos by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Steve Goldie looks at a broken old printer tossed in a box of obsolete electronic equipment at UCSC's Receiving Services, he doesn't see a piece of plastic, metal, and hazardous waste headed for eternal life in a trash heap.</p>
<p>To the Receiving Services manager, the piles of so-called "e-waste" at UCSC's receiving area on Delaware Avenue represent UCSC's commitment to recycling.</p>
<p>"We're really trying to divert as much waste as possible from going into landfills," said Goldie, while standing next to a box of mixed e-waste--from discarded cameras to outdated computers and printers--on a recent overcast weekday morning. "That's the goal."</p>
<p>On Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Receiving Services offers free self-service drop-off of e-waste for recycling at its 2300 Delaware Avenue facility. Drop-offs can also be made by appointment.</p>
<p>Examples of e-waste include air conditioners, CD/DVD/VCR players, cell phones, medical equipment, TVs, wires, cords, and cables, and more.</p>
<p>He estimated that the campus sends approximately 4,000 pounds of e-waste off for recycling a month. Even with an awareness program by Housing Services, the amount goes up about 25 percent during student move-out periods, since students often abandon goods such as TVs, monitors, stereos, lamps, and microwaves.</p>
<p>Receiving Services resells a small amount of refurbished items as surplus.</p>
<p>UCSC has been recycling e-waste since 2000. But the campus recently contracted with Direct Computer Disposal of San Leandro in order to comply with a recent UC Office of the President requirement that campuses contract with recyclers who have signed on to the True Stewardship Pledge, an agreement that the recycler will abide by a set of eight rules.</p>
<p>The rules include agreeing not to allow hazardous e-waste to be exported to developing countries or sent to prisons for recycling, and ensuring that every stop on the recycling chain meets environmental and health regulations.</p>
<p>The reason for signing on with such recyclers "revolves around the sustainability effort we've got going," said Goldie, referring to UCSC's work to advance environmental and conservation programs.</p>
<p>It's also the law. California enacted landmark legislation in 2003 to establish a funding system for the collection and recycling of certain electronic wastes. The California Integrated Waste Management Board has adopted regulations to implement portions of the statute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, electronic discards are one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's waste stream, according to the California Integrated Waste Management Board. The goal of e-waste legislation is to reduce waste, but also, certain components of some electronic products, such as cathode ray tubes from TVs and monitors, contain materials that make them hazardous.</p>
<p>The kind of stuff UCSC collects for recycling runs the gamut from old TVs to refrigeration units.</p>
<p>"We get a lot of older scientific gear, older things that have been in closets or wherever," said Kelly Mitchell, surplus administrator, picking up an old motherboard from a trash bin filled with them.</p>
<p>Recyclers smelt down e-waste for the metal and copper they contain, said Mitchell. And items such as circuit boards contain semi-precious and precious metals such as gold, silver, and palladium.</p>
<p>"Everything eventually gets broken down to the commodity level," Mitchell said.</p>
<p>For the campus, there's no real profit in collecting e-waste, said Goldie. Earnings offset Receiving Services operating costs for gathering the discarded electronics.</p>

The award is conferred in recognition of lifetime achievements in research and provides support for the recipient to carry out research projects in cooperation with specialist colleagues in Germany.</p><p>Zachos will be working with colleagues at the University of Bremen to continue his research on global warming and the linkage between Earth's climate and the carbon cycle. In particular, they will evaluate carbon cycle dynamics, ocean acidification, and carbon sequestration, using prehistoric episodes of ocean acidification as case studies. These rare events involved the relatively rapid release of large masses of carbon into the atmosphere, triggering global warming.</p><p>Coe will spend fall quarter this year working with colleagues at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich to study "geomagnetic superchrons." These are unusually long periods of time when Earth's magnetic field did not reverse its polarity. The geologic record shows that the magnetic field has changed directions many times--about five times per million years on average during the past 20 million years. Superchrons, however, can last tens of millions of years; the most recent lasted from 121 million years ago to 84 million years ago.</p><p>"Why the field stops reversing for such long periods of time is still not known, but it seems likely that superchrons signal special conditions in Earth's lowermost mantle that may have significant geological manifestations on the surface," Coe said.</p><p>The Humboldt Foundation grants up to 100 Humboldt Research Awards annually, each valued at 60,000 euros. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91576dd28072704601a012ffc36ac726"><name>2326</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MyUCSC has new look, new features</title><keywords>MyUCSC</keywords><start-date>1215673200000</start-date><display-name>MyUCSC has new look,...</display-name><path>/2008/07/2326</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/07/2326</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338680172</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338680172</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If you've signed in to the MyUCSC portal recently, you may have noticed some big changes. </p><p>MyUCSC is the online system that provides a variety of services for students, faculty, and staff, including the ability to enroll in classes, check grades, and view student information. During the Fourth of July weekend, Academic Information Systems (AIS) upgraded MyUCSC to implement some improvements and new features for students, faculty, and staff. </p><p>MyUCSC now has an updated look and feel, as well as some new tools that should help save you time and make things easier.</p><p> </p><p>The new MyUCSC features for faculty include the Faculty Center, where faculty can enter grades, download class rosters, and view their weekly teaching schedules, all on the same page. The process for downloading class and grade rosters has also been streamlined, and now takes only one click. Additionally, faculty can easily email some or all of the students in their classes directly from the roster view.</p><p>For students, MyUCSC now offers the Student Center, where students can search for and enroll in classes, as well as view grades, holds, and financial information, all in one convenient location. Class Search has been redesigned so that students can search for and enroll in classes directly in MyUCSC. Another new feature for students is My Planner, where students can browse the Course Catalog and track courses for future enrollment.</p><p>Advising staff will notice some improvements to View My Advisees, via access to the new Student Center, where they can look up and update student information, including declarations, checklists, and holds. The process for updating class and section limits is also improved. And all staff will be able to use the one-click download button for any grid of data in the system.</p><p>To sign in to MyUCSC, visit <a href="https://my.ucsc.edu">https://my.ucsc.edu</a>. The Office of the Registrar and the ITS Support Center are ready to support the campus in understanding and utilizing the changes to MyUCSC.

<p>Pioneering environmental studies professor Michael SoulÃ© was quoted in a <strong><em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong> story about conflicts emerging near national parks in developing countries, where an influx of funds from conservationists is increasing living standards--and attracting new residents whose activities may threaten the protected areas. Tensions in 'gateway communities' underscore the need for limits to sprawl in and around parks, said SoulÃ©.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> tapped prison expert Craig Haney of psychology for comment about fights that broke out in three separate Oklahoma state penitentiaries recently. Haney cited overcrowding as the "most significant, problematic fact of contemporary prison life in the United States."</p>

Injury prevention and safety is something that each individual must assume ownership for if we are to get through a strike day or any regular workday, injury free. During a strike, routine services may be altered and you may find that you are doing tasks that you do not normally perform (at least at work) in order to make the best of the situation. This is when injuries are more likely to occur so we want to urge you to plan ahead before you perform an unfamiliar task. You must be thoughtful and deliberate in your approach to ensure each new task is completed safely. Failing to do so can result in an injury that is potentially debilitating, demoralizing and even life altering.</p><p>A serious injury can result from something as simple as walking your trash out to the dumpster where inattention can result in a slip and fall, back (lifting, twisting) injury, strained shoulder (swinging the bag into the dumpster while holding the lid open) and cuts from sharp objects. This is just an example but it illustrates that we need to be very attentive to how we work and again we want to emphasize that when we do something that is not part of our normal routine, the risk of injury is even higher. If you have any question or doubt about how to do something safely the simple solution is to <b>NOT DO IT</b> until you can discuss it with your supervisor and coworkers or contact the Environmental Health and Safety Department (9-2553) for advice.  Getting a co-worker to assist you is almost always a good precaution.

Mike passed away on July 7 after a courageous battle with lung disease. He was 63.</p>
<p>Mike dedicated his life to the care of animals. Before coming to the university he was, for many years, an animal technician for Santa Cruz Veterinary Hospital. He cared for animals at the university for 20 years. He thought of the animals first, everything else second. The day of the Sinshimer fire, he crossed fire lines to be sure his animals were OK. We, his coworkers, considered him a friend closer than family. He was always generous and willing to help; he was a team player. He never missed a day. He made our little corner of the university into a family.</p>
<p>He served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War and was a member of the USS Saint Paul Association. A native of Southern California, Mike lived his last 20 years in Santa Cruz, a town he loved.</p>
<p>Among his many interests were table tennis -- he belonged to the U.S. Table Tennis Association -- body surfing, reading, movies and music, music, music. He was a big supporter of Public Radio and was known to many programmers at the local stations in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A celebration of his life will take place in Santa Cruz on a date to be announced later.</p>
<p>Contributions in Michael's honor should be made to the Santa Cruz SPCA</p>

<p>Summer is conference season, and from June 22 to August 30, the campus will roll out the welcome mat for approximately 10,000 visitors. The guests will attend 70 different conferences or camps, learning about everything from developmental biology to cheerleading.</p>
<p>The majority of groups focus on academic pursuits, but sports and music camps also make up a large portion of programs, said Martha Keeler, Colleges and University Housing Services assistant director for conference services.</p>
<p>Adult program participants may share knowledge in a particular field, such as biology or financial planning. Other participants may study accelerated math and science, and still others could be training in a sport.</p>
<p>"All programs enjoy the beauty of our campus and the surrounding area," said Keeler. "Most take trips to the Santa Cruz area, the Boardwalk, the beach, the downtown area, and outlying counties."</p>
<p>Some of the groups have been making UCSC their summer home for more than two decades, including the Dickens Project, USA cheerleaders, Nike Tennis Camps, and Math Science Upward Bound.</p>
<p>But 10 groups will be on campus for the first time, said Keeler.</p>
<p>Those programs include Cognitive Aging Research, cosponsored by UC Davis; Girls Scouts of Santa Clara County; Kokusai Butoku-Kai, an international martial arts program; Lifetouch Publishing, which provides training in yearbook publishing; and Ocean Explorers, a marine studies camp from Long Marine Lab and the Seymour Center for students 12-14.</p>
<p>USA cheer is the largest program. It has nine camps, each with 200-500 participants.</p>
<p>The activity is good news for UCSC's bottom line, bringing in almost $4 million in gross revenue to campus.</p>
<p>Housed in residence halls and apartments, conference participants will also use classrooms,&#8232; lounges, and outdoor field spaces throughout the campus.</p>
<p>The majority of conferences are youth programs, ages 9 through high school, though visitors come in all ages and from around the world, said Keeler.</p>
<p>Not only are summer conferences fun and enlightening for participants, but they're also good for UCSC, she said.</p>
<p>Among the benefits, she said, conferences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expose the UCSC campus to a broader community;<br/>
<br/>


</li>
<li>Allow faculty to highlight the campus with their colleagues from around the world;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Attract a large population of pre-college-age young people who may later decide to make UCSC their college choice;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Bring visitors and revenue to the greater Santa Cruz area, enhancing the relationship between UCSC and the city and county.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Instead, many hit the books and took advantage of a wide variety of academic enrichment programs offered by the UCSC <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/">Educational Partnership Center</a> (EPC). </p><p>Students built robots, designed video games, solved math word problems, visited college campuses, and participated in mentoring workshops as part of the EPC's efforts to improve student academic achievement and help students prepare for college, during the summer as well as during the school year.</p><p>"These programs transform students' by lives helping students set new goals for college and careers, and parents learn to support the skills and work habits to get there. We hope this model of using summer school to advance students rather than remediate them will be adopted by schools in the region," said Carrol Moran, executive director of EPC.</p><p>Developed by the UC Office of the President and implemented statewide, the Summer Algebra Academy (SAA) is a four- to five-week program for ninth-grade students centered around a college-awareness theme. The academy is designed to increase student academic performance in math, introduce families to higher education, initiate systemic change in high schools, and create a college-going culture. EPC first piloted the program in 2006 and expanded it this summer to seven SAA sites across Santa Cruz, Monterey, and Santa Clara Counties, serving more than 500 students.</p><p>"It goes far beyond algebra learning to dream and build a plan to realize your dream," said EPC deputy director Pablo Reguerin. "Algebra is a tool to prepare students for success in high school and reach their career and education goals."</p><p>SAA is a joint venture between EPC, partner K-12 schools and districts, and outreach programs under the EPC umbrella, such as the Early Academic Outreach Program, GEAR UP, and the MESA Schools Program. Unlike a remedial summer school program, the emphasis is on getting students ready for success in algebra in high school. SAA addresses many of the factors that influence the success of incoming high school students, including fear of facilities, connecting with a caring adult at a new school, easing the transition from middle to high school, and engaging parents and fostering strong school-family relationships. Often high school freshman do not understand the importance of ninth grade and under-perform in their classes, do not complete homework, and/or fail Algebra I, all of which contribute to the tenth-grade dropout problem, said Reguerin.</p><p>SAA is a strategic intervention to address these issues and prepare more students for academic success. Students received about 100 hours of engaging, hands-on mathematics curriculum and about 40 hours of college-readiness seminars, including field trips to UCSC and other college campuses. For many students and families, it was their first visit to a university and an eye-opening experience about the possibilities for their future. College-readiness seminars helped students develop an academic plan and learn important skills, including time management, note taking, and test taking. Concurrent parent academies taught parents about college systems and high school requirements.</p><p>Inspiring students to envision themselves as future engineers and scientists, the Girls in Engineering program brought 30 middle-school girls from Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties together for a unique, 12-day introduction to engineering at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering in June and July. </p><p>Designed to broaden the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline, students participated in variety of hands-on projects, from working in teams to build bridges and towers to solving difficult "challenge" problems. Students also learned to build and program a motorized robot to move on command and perform tasks and tricks.</p><p>Special guest speakers included UCSC associate professor of computer engineering Tracy Larrabee, undergraduate students, and three women engineers from the Santa Cruz City Water Department and City of Watsonville. Students also took exciting field trips to The Tech Museum of Innovation, Pacific Plastics and Engineering, and Google, as well as tours of the SURF-IT and renewable energy resources labs in the engineering school, and they participated in a scavenger hunt across campus.</p><p>"(Girls in Engineering) is a wonderful program for all girls. I came here thinking that engineering was only for men and it was completely nerdy," said a student participant. "Now that I think about it, I am totally wrong. Engineering opens up a whole new chance to do whatever I want."</p><p>Inspired by the vision of Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes Baskin and first piloted in 2006, the program is a collaborative effort between EPC, the Baskin School of Engineering, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. EPC secured additional grant funding this year from the S.D. Bechtel, Jr., Foundation; the AAUW Educational Foundation; and Cisco Foundation.</p><p>High school students also gave top marks to the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program, a four-week residential program that offered 150 students an unparalleled opportunity to work side-by-side with outstanding researchers and university faculty, covering topics that extend beyond the typical high school curriculum.</p><p>UCSC faculty taught nine clusters, ranging from chemistry, robots, and nanotechnology to marine mammals and video game design. COSMOS Discovery Lectures featured special research presentations by UCSC faculty and other scientists, and students participated in the Intel Research Award Poster Presentation Competition, as well as workshops on graduate school, applying to UC, and financial aid. Field trips offered students behind-the-scenes access to Long Marine Laboratory, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Natural Bridges State Park, Lick Observatory, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and Año Nuevo State Reserve.</p><p>"Working in a real research lab and talking to actual researchers taught me a lot about real science," said COSMOS 2007 participant Gerald Junsay. "These four weeks gave me a whole new look at the field of science and math, and helped me realize I belong in the field."</p><p>COSMOS alumni are eligible to receive research awards and college scholarships and to attend the annual California Nobel Laureate event. This summer, 15 alumni participated in a six-week, full-time internship program at Cisco Systems. In addition, the COSMOS Teacher Fellow program pairs local math and science teachers with UCSC faculty; this year, the program included students in the Cal Teach program.</p><p>Finally, 100 ninth-grade students from the Pajaro Valley Unified School District convened at College 9 for the Summer Youth Leadership Conference (SYLC), a collaboration between EPC and Migrant Education Region XI. The three-day residential program focused on developing students' academic and leadership skills.</p><p>"Since the first SYLC, this conference has proven to change the mindset of traditionally non-college-going students," said EPC college facilitator Sofia Diaz. "It has created great high school leaders who have gone on to achieve their college aspirations, all the while creating a path for their peers and future generations to do the same."</p><p>The conference focused on developing students' leadership qualities and creating a cohort of "college ambassadors" who will become resources for their peers. The goal is to help students make a successful transition from middle school to high school; workshops included sessions on test taking, writing, and study skills. Students also learned about the A-G high school course pattern for college eligibility and high school "do's and don'ts."</p><p>High school peer mentors and undergraduate academic interns, including two UCSC students, are heavily involved in the planning process and are responsible for facilitating all group discussions and leading activities, said Diaz. "They are essential to the success of SYLC, because peer-to-peer outreach is an important part of leadership development," she said.</p><p>"Being able to help students make positive decisions and planting that little seed of motivation to reach higher education is such an amazing feeling," said peer mentor Monica Santana. "The best part of it all has been seeing my little brother participating and helping us all share, inspire, and create the leaders of the future."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91577cc98072704601a012ff1c031352"><name>2339</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dickens Universe offers unforgettable intellectual retreat</title><summary>The Dickens Universe combines elements of a research symposium, arts festival, book club, and summer camp all rolled into one big, unforgettable week of intellectual celebration.</summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>dickens project, john jordan, literature, England, symposium, research, scholar</keywords><description>The Dickens Universe combines elements of a research symposium, arts festival, book club, and summer camp all rolled into one big, unforgettable week of intellectual celebration.</description><start-date>1217228400000</start-date><display-name>Dickens Universe offers unforgettable...</display-name><path>/2008/07/2339</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/07/2339</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338684056</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338684056</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/07/images/dickens_photo.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/07/images/dickens_photo.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dickens_photo.300.jpg</name><file-size>40039</file-size><width>300</width><height>204</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Literature professor John Jordan, director of the Dickens Project, and project coordinator JoAnna Rottke (Photo by Scott Rappaport)

A scholarly consortium headquartered at UCSC, it consists of faculty and graduate students from all UC campuses, as well as from 16 other major American and international universities.</p><p>The Dickens Universe is regularly attended by more than 200 participants of different ages and backgrounds. It provides a relaxed and supportive summer environment in which to pursue serious intellectual inquiry.</p><p>"This year we're focusing on two novels rather than the usual one--<i>Hard Times</i> by Dickens and <i>Mary Barton</i> by Elizabeth Gaskell, a contemporary of Dickens," noted John Jordan, director of the Dickens Project and professor of literature at UCSC. </p><p>"Both are industrial novels about the north of England during the 19th century, which was the center of the Industrial Revolution," he added. "Both works deal with factory conditions, working class life, and the struggle for recognition and autonomy among workers."</p><p>"These novels seem particularly appropriate this year in light of the economic period we're currently passing through," Jordan observed. "The title <i>Hard Times</i> is quite apt."</p><p>The 2008 Dickens Universe runs from Sunday July 27 to Saturday August 2. At the end of the week, there is also an additional symposium focusing on collaboration--including the use of electronic media and the web--in the development of scholarship about Victorian Literature and culture. </p><p>For more  information about the 2008 Dickens Universe, contact project coordinator JoAnna Rottke at (831) 459-2103 or e-mail  dpj@ucsc.edu. </p><p>							</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91577dfc8072704601a012ffd221fb40"><name>2340</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Opinion: Toward A New Fee Advocacy Strategy</title><summary>Student Regent D'Artagnan Scorza speaks out against student fee increases and reports on the efforts of the UC Funding Task Force on behalf of students. &#13;

This has resulted in a significant decline in state support for California's higher education system.  From 2001 to 2004, undergraduate students and their parents were overwhelmed with <b>consecutive fee increases</b>: the student fees of seniors are now 46 percent more in constant dollars than when they first enrolled at the University of California. (<i>Fiscal Profiles, 2004,</i> California Postsecondary Education Commission). This figure has more than doubled since then and it has placed pressure on the University to maintain access, quality, and affordability during the 2008-09 budget year and most certainly in the near future. </p><p>The UC Board of Regents face difficult decisions as they attempt to meet the needs of the University while maintaining the commitment to California's Master Plan for Higher Education. The Regents assert that revenue must be raised via one of the University's primary funding mechanisms: student fees. As both a member of the Board of Regents and a student, it is plain to see that students are getting the short of end the stick. Since 2001, student fees have increased 93 percent for undergraduates, and 106 percent for graduate students. On May 14, 2008, the Regents voted once again to raise student fees by 7.4 percent, for the 2008-09 academic year, which has resulted in an over <b>100 percent increase in student fees since 2001</b>. </p><p>Taxing students and their families to secure the University's future is not the direction we should take. Collectively, <b>we need a reinvestment in higher education</b> by prioritizing its importance in the state budget. On average, for every Californian dollar invested in higher education, we receive a return of three. As students, we have consistently raised our voices and spoken about our concerns.  We have protested, held rallies and some of us have even been arrested. All of these forms of action are necessary in the fight for justice, but there are also other ways.  </p><p>In response to the budget challenges, the student Regent and the University of California Student Association (UCSA) <b>formed the UC Funding Task Force</b> in the fall of 2007 in order to provide ongoing advice and council to the Board of Regents, UC Office of the President administration, and the Academic Senate regarding student fees from the student purview. Its charge was to accumulate budget data, information on long-range planning, Regental priorities, student needs assessments, funding pipelines, and fee accountability metrics. Its goal was to address the current budget cycle concerns, prioritize student needs, and develop long-range planning for the use of student fees, centering on the needs of students.</p><p>Since the fall of 2007, the Task Force has actively and successfully engaged the Regents and Office of the President, which resulted in an increase to student mental health aid, an increase to graduate student support, and the maintenance of Academic Preparation funding at 2007-08 levels during this difficult budget year. These efforts <b>helped secure 51 million dollars in funding priorities for students</b> in the 2008-09 budget. Additionally, we successfully halted a 10 percent fee increase. Unfortunately a 7.4 percent educational fee was approved, but the task force remains committed to preventing any increase in student fees. </p><p>Through its research, the Task Force has exposed different funding challenges and is working to develop a strategy to address them. Over the course of the year, it has also helped shape the messaging and strategy for statewide student efforts against fee increases.</p><p>Given the recent dramatic fee increases, it has become apparent that both the state and the UC are balancing the budget by taxing. The work of the Task Force, then, is to facilitate the discussion on student fees in a manner that will curtail this adverse pattern and prioritize the needs of students.</p><p>After a year of work focused on the development of the 2008-09 budget, the Task Force is currently <b>advocating for an audit on student fees</b> to address funding shortfalls in student services. Additionally, the Task Force is suggesting that the Regents adopt a <b>long-term student fee policy</b> that will address the challenges of the State budget shortfalls. It is also <b>soliciting systemwide student input</b> on the budget and advocacy process, as well as developing alternative funding solutions that do not include student fee increases.</p><p>The UC Funding Task Force has demonstrated significant success in helping to shape the budget according to student needs and will need all of your support in this effort to fund our future. The State must prioritize higher education. <b>The University must prioritize student needs.</b> We are the future citizens of California and alumni of this great University.</p><p>D'Artagnan Scorza</p><p>UC Funding Task Force, Co-Chair</p><p>UC Student Regent 2008-09</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91577f258072704601a012ff8c356b5f"><name>2341</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the News</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1216969200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/07/2341</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/07/2341</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338684657</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338684657</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

At the same time, we recognize the severity of the budget crisis confronting the State, and as in the past, UC will take appropriate measures to assist the Governor and the State in addressing its fiscal situation.</p><p>We will let you know if our understanding of the University's obligations regarding this issue changes.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Mark G.
