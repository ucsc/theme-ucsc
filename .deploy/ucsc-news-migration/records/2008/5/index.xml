The campus car-sharing program will soon expand its fleet of vehicles from seven to nine or 10. (Photo by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kaitlin Ashley's car broke down two years ago, and she didn't have the money to fix it.</p>
<p>So the 21-year-old Santa Cruz resident, whose partner is a full-time UCSC student, looked into getting a new one. Then along came Zipcar.</p>
<p>The car-sharing service partnered with UCSC in September to put a total of seven vehicles on the UCSC campus, at 2300 Delaware Ave., and in a downtown Santa Cruz lot. Members pay an application fee, an annual membership fee (waived for UC affiliates), and an hourly or daily rate to use the cars.</p>
<p>The service eliminated Ashley's need to buy a car - and pay for upkeep, maintenance, fees, and insurance, not to mention parking permits and ever-more-expensive gas.</p>
<p>Now, Ashley, who works near her home in downtown Santa Cruz, reserves a car when she needs it for trips to Costco or IKEA, or to visit family. Owning a car, she said, is just "not worth it."</p>
<p>Turns out, so many students, faculty, staff, and community members agree with Ashley that the Zipcar service brought to campus and environs by UCSC has become the most well-utilized and fastest-growing car-share program of any university in the nation.</p>
<p>Because of that success, Zipcar is now expanding its UCSC program, sending two to three more cars in May to join the current fleet.</p>
<p>"Give us a little time, and this program is gonna spread like wildfire," said Larry Pageler, director of Transportation and Parking Services.</p>
<p>UCSC's cars consist of three Toyota Priuses, two Honda Elements, a Toyota Matrix, and a Mazda3. The new cars will likely include another Prius, as well as another Mazda or Matrix, or both.</p>
<p>And if things continue to go well, Zipcar could add even more cars.</p>
<p>"Zipcar plans to expand as necessary," said Jenny Larios Berlin, general manager of universities at Zipcar. "If, after we add the additional cars we still see a high utilization rate, we will add vehicles to the fleet."</p>
<p>In late April, Pageler also announced that Zipcars can now also be used for short-term UC business-related trips.</p>
<p>The reason for the program's rapid growth here is twofold, said Teresa Buika, campus transportation planner.</p>
<p>"One of the main reasons it's so successful is we have a lot of residential freshmen and sophomores, and they're prohibited from bringing cars to campus," she said.</p>
<p>The campus barred residential freshmen and sophomores from having cars on campus years ago as a congestion-cutting and parking-relief move. About 75-80 percent of students living on campus are freshmen and sophomores.</p>
<p>Also, she said, the program has "kind of a 'green' focus," with its Priuses and other fuel-efficient cars and its business model of shared resources.</p>
<p>Many of the people using the service "are conscious of their carbon footprint and concerned about climate change, and want to make sustainable "green" choices," said Pageler.</p>
<p>Studies by Zipcar have shown that their car-sharing programs have many "green" benefits to campuses and local communities. Each Zipcar typically replaces up to 20 personally owned vehicles, reducing the need for additional parking spaces and replacing older vehicles with new ones that have more stringent pollution controls. Zipcar members tend to drive significantly less, resulting in less congestion and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Members tend to use a variety of alternative modes and use Zipcar only when they need to.</p>
<p>Zipcar member Ashley likes the environmental aspect, but also the convenience factor.</p>
<p>"Whenever I want, I can book it and do a trip real fast," she said. "And it's like a little vacation. You can put your CD in and drive around, you don't have to worry about insurance and gas--it's nice."</p>
<p>UCSC's Zipcars are used on average 42 percent of the time, said Pageler. On weekends, usage can rocket to 85-90 percent. Zipcar typically looks at expanding its programs once they get to 45-50 percent utilization; UCSC was hitting that mark within two to three months, said Pageler.</p>
<p>The quick ramp-up is a convergence of a few key elements, said Zipcar's Larios Berlin.</p>
<p>"The university community is alternatively minded and open to eco-friendly solutions," she said. "Also, the program is not that far from one of our major metropolitan markets, which means that the education process is much, much faster, thus expediting the adoption of the program in the community."</p>
<p>UCSC's membership has swelled to 475 users in its seven months.</p>
<p>"With only seven cars in the system, that's pretty remarkable," said Pageler.</p>
<p>His overall aim is increase quality of life on campus and in the community by reducing the number of trips to campus, cutting the campus's impact on the environment, and decreasing parking demand both on campus and in adjacent neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he'd like to see the program expand further into the community.</p>
<p>"We'd like to see car-sharing accommodate community members who might not need a second car, or any car at all," Pageler said. "If we can help spread that benefit, it's a win-win for everyone."</p>

<p>Such moments of levity were frequent in a group interview last week between the UC president-designate and faculty/staff newspaper editors and reporters from UC campuses.</p>
<p>Yudof, 63, head of the University of Texas system, will succeed President Robert C. Dynes, who announced last August that he would step down by June 2008 after nearly five years as president.</p>
<p>The newly appointed UC leader, who starts work June 16, was visiting the Bay Area as part of his transition to the presidency, and he made himself available at UC Office of the President by conference call to address questions from the internal editors and reporters.</p>
<p>Yudof previously was president of the University of Minnesota and a longtime faculty member, dean and provost at the University of Texas at Austin. He began his academic career at UT Austin in 1971 as an assistant professor of law and later became dean of the School of Law from 1984 to 1994 and executive vice president and provost from 1994 to 1997, when he left for the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>He's recently been meeting with policy-makers in Sacramento, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as he prepares to take office at UC. But he cautioned campus editors last week that he might not have all the answers just yet.</p>
<p>"Remember, I'm still the pretender," Yudof said. "I don't have the complete information, and I'm still learning about UC."</p>
<p>Editors then questioned Yudof on topics including his plans for fixing UC's budget, which areas will receive his immediate attention, and his experience at the University of Texas that could help him tackle UC challenges.</p>
<p>"The first priority for me is to get some things done in the Office of the President," Yudof said. "It's clear that by national and any other standards we're overstaffed, and I need to look at that." A UCOP restructuring plan, begun last year, seeks to reduce the Office of the President's budget by 20 percent.</p>
<p>The "real action" is on the campuses, Yudof said. "I'm not planning on a major initiative--I want to save money [at UCOP] and get out of the way," he said. "Frankly, I want to save money and put it on the campuses. We have a lot of good places to put the money."</p>
<p>He plans to visit the campuses shortly after he starts work. "I don't want to be too elaborate, but I would like to visit them all," he said.</p>
<p>On the topic of tree-sitters, Yudof said there's no universal answer, but "being a lawyer, my feeling is you enforce the law. Frankly, I don't understand the property rights of the tree-sitters and in some cases why it takes so much time to get them out of the trees."</p>
<p>He supports academic discourse and freedom, he said. "People certainly have a right to protest, but if you're holding up university business, that's another issue."</p>
<p>As for tuition increases--Gov. Schwarzenegger's proposed budget cuts, which would slash UC funding by $332 million, once again have raised the specter of increased student fees--Yudof said, "That is a very difficult issue."</p>
<p>The UC system faces a shortfall of $417 million--the difference between the governor's plan and the Regents' budget request for 2008-09.</p>
<p>"When the price goes up, you have to think very creatively about how we maintain access," he said.</p>
<p>Yudof has voiced concern over the rising cost of public higher education and the national dwindling of state support for these institutions.</p>
<p>"If I had my way, the closer tuition is to zero, the happier I am," he told a UCOP publication in April. "I don't want a person to be precluded from coming to the University of California because they can't afford it."</p>

<p>"This ranking underscores UCSC's commitment to reducing our carbon footprint," said UCSC Chancellor George R. Blumenthal. "We're leading the way and helping to build the market for renewable electricity so others will follow."</p>
<p>Blumenthal, hailing the recent release of UCSC's 2007 Campus Sustainability Assessment, said he wants UCSC to be a leader in sustainability and "green" initiatives.</p>
<p>The EPA rankings are available <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/toplists/top10ed.htm">online</a>.</p>
<p>UCSC's leadership as a consumer of renewable power was made possible by students who voted in May 2006 to pay a tuition increase of $3 per quarter to fund the purchase of clean, sustainable energy in the form of renewable energy certificates (RECs). As a result of that student initiative, UCSC buys enough RECs to offset 100 percent of the electricity that powers the campus.</p>
<p>UCSC contracts with Sterling Planet to purchase RECs generated by wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass, and landfill gas. Green power produces less carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas linked to global climate change) than conventional sources of electricity, which include coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>According to the EPA's listing of 2007-08 College &amp; University Green Power Champions, UCSC purchased 57 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green energy in the form of RECs during the 2007-08 academic year. To participate in the challenge, schools must buy at least 10 million kilowatt-hours of green power.</p>
<p>The campus is also working to reduce overall demand by retrofitting equipment, adopting energy-efficient building designs, and developing on-site sources of renewable power, said Ilse Kolbus, director of the UCSC Physical Plant.</p>

UCSC is collaborating with the Felidae Conservation Fund and the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) on the project, with additional support from California State Parks.</p><p>Understanding puma behavior is important as development pressures contribute to more frequent encounters between humans and mountain lions. The Bay Area Puma Project will utilize novel technology developed at UCSC to answer questions that have so far evaded scientists. </p><p>Ecologist Chris Wilmers, assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC and the lead investigator on the project, and Terrie Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, will team up to explore questions of puma behavior, physiology, and ecology. </p><p>"We're trying to learn as much as possible about mountain lions--where they live, what their range and dietary needs are, and how to minimize conflict with humans," said Wilmers.</p><p>During the first year of the project, Wilmers's team will place special tracking collars on up to five pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Global positioning satellite (GPS) devices on the collars will gather location information, and a novel accelerometer on the collar will record fine-grained data on behavior and movement. Developed by UCSC electrical engineering graduate student Matthew Rutishauser, the device will literally measure the acceleration behind each footstep.</p><p>"The GPS device will record the lion's location every 20 minutes, and the accelerometer will measure activity continuously, including every two-minute run, every time the animal stands still, every drink of water," said Wilmers. "Terrie will take that information about footfall frequency and convert it to calorie-burning. It will hone and refine our ability to identify corridors and habitat quality." </p><p>Pumas feed mostly on deer, and the range of an individual lion varies from 20 square miles to as much as 500 square miles, depending on food availability, said Wilmers, whose other research projects include the study of interactions among wolves and elk in Yellowstone National Park.</p><p>"If we want the mountain lion to survive, given all the development occurring in the area, where are the important habitats and corridors?" asked Wilmers. "How are they getting across Highway 17? How are they getting across Highway 92, or Highway 101? For that matter, how do they get from the Santa Cruz Mountains to the Diablo Range, or the Gavilan Mountains, or the Santa Lucia Mountains?"</p><p>The Bay Area Puma Project will make a major contribution by gathering and linking habitat and physiology data. The project includes an advisory group of puma researchers and conservationists who will provide input and guidance over the course of the study.</p><p>"Given the real factors that influence human and puma encounters, can a combination of pioneering scientific research, education, and public outreach provide a new model for human-puma coexistence?" asked project partner Zara McDonald, executive director of the Felidae Conservation Fund, a Marin County-based nonprofit dedicated to the protection of all wild species of cats and their habitats. "This is an essential component, given the fragmentation of habitat and the increase in development along puma movement corridors in the Bay Area." </p><p>Mountain lions are secretive animals, so researchers know very little about their hunting capabilities beyond the fact that they surprise their prey from short distances. Williams--whose pioneering study of the energetics of marine mammals and other terrestrial carnivores, including cheetahs, African lions, and otters, set the stage for this study of puma physiology--said the accelerometer will reveal landmark details of puma hunting habits and caloric needs. </p><p>"Their movement during a strike is so different from other movements that it will leave a unique signature in the data," said Williams, who will use the information to calculate the daily calorie consumption and energy requirements of pumas as they move through their daily activities. These data will eventually be used to assess how vulnerable the puma is to environmental and habitat disturbance.</p><p>After pumas are outfitted with the combined GPS/accelerometer collars, data will be retrieved from the collar every couple of weeks using a remotely triggered radio uplink. Those data will be paired with GPS data to identify kill locations, and researchers will then locate and study the remains of lion prey.</p><p>Wilmers plans to expand the current three-year pilot study to include the Diablo Range east of San Francisco, as well as the North Bay region. The combined GPS/accelerometer technology will be adaptable to the study of other species, he noted.</p><p></p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Chris Wilmers and Terrie Williams may be reached by contacting Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495 or jmcnulty@ucsc.edu; Zara McDonald may be reached at (415) 250-0425 or bapp@felidaefund.org.</p><p>About the Felidae Conservation Fund: Formed in 2006, the fund is a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to the long-term survival of wild cat species and the ecosystems they support, with the goal of fostering a world where wild cats thrive in co-existence with people and the environment.

Performance appraisals are required annually for all career staff employees and are an essential component of a successful performance management program. I ask for your full participation in making this another record year in the performance completion rate for each division. We had a 95% completion rate for the 2006-07 review period which was an improvement over the previous year.  This is an impressive record and I hope we will improve even more this year.</p><p>Overall, the process this year is very similar to last year.  We are beginning the process earlier to allow more time to meet the summer deadline.  New appraisal forms that were introduced for the 2006-07 review period included a standards section for managers and supervisors to be implemented in 2008.  This new section is to be used by those who manage other managers and supervisors and is to be completed for the current review period, July 2007 through June 2008.  All appraisal forms are provided on line at:  <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/forms.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/manage-performance/forms.htm</a></p><p>I strongly encourage principal officers to establish divisional guidelines that outline expectations for the performance review and establish requirements for the use of the standardized forms. Your division may choose to designate one or more specific forms to be used, depending on the job responsibilities for employees being reviewed.</p><p>Completed and signed performance appraisals should be submitted to the appropriate service team in Staff Human Resources (SHR) by close of business on Friday, August 15, 2008. Managers and supervisors who leave for the summer months or supervise staff on summer furloughs are encouraged to complete the required forms in May or June in order to meet the August 15 deadline.</p><p>The completion of the performance appraisal is an important final step in the 2007-08 performance management process. This announcement is being sent to all managers, supervisors, staff and faculty who supervise staff.  SHR also provides classroom training and in-house briefings for learning performance management skills. If you have not already done so, I recommend that you enroll in the existing Performance Management Series. A new web based training program will also be available on line in mid-May.</p><p>For further information regarding the performance management process, please contact your service team or Senior HR Partner Cecile Morris (x9-3935 or <a href="mailto:cecile@ucsc.edu">cecile@ucsc.edu</a>).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Principal Officers; Managers and Supervisors</audience><admin>Willeen McQuitta, Director Staff Human Resources</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91569e5c8072704601a012ffeb21654d"><name>2179</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Summer 2008 Orientation - Dates Update</title><start-date>1209970800000</start-date><display-name>Summer 2008 Orientation -...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2179</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2179</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338627089</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338627089</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Each year the campus officially welcomes new students and their families and guests during Summer Orientation.

The addition will be McHenry Library for the next phase, while the old building is renovated.   During this period, while we are squeezed into half of our normal space with reconfigured facilities, we hope you will find the same high quality of service in this new setting.  The complete McHenry expansion and renovation project will be finished in late 2009 or early 2010. It promises to provide our community with a splendid 21st century library, well worth these temporary inconveniences.</p><p>To celebrate this major milestone in updating and expanding the University Library, the Board of the Friends of the UCSC Library invites you to an open house and tours of the McHenry Addition on May 21, 5:30-7:00pm.  There will be guided tours of the new building and its gardens, including the Mary Ackerknecht Reading Garden. Refreshments will be served.</p><p>If you have not already visited us in our new location, I invite you to come by and check out it out.  Our  new entrance can be found at the southwest corner of the Addition (the Performing Arts side).  The north side of the old building has been fenced off and foot traffic from Bay Tree Plaza, Science Hill, and the Hahn parking lot is being routed around the construction site (via stairs and a boardwalk).  The road and path from Performing Arts are open again and metered parking along with handicapped/medical parking, are again available closer to the library.

The center will house an interdisciplinary program involving faculty from five departments at UCSC and collaborators at other institutions.</p><p>"We're delighted at this latest in an ongoing line of successes in obtaining funding for cutting-edge biomedical research at UCSC," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research. "For an institution that has no medical school, but does have a history of high-quality biomedical work, major grants such as this one are wonderful affirmations of the quality of our faculty." </p><p>The new grant was among $271 million in major facilities grants approved by the CIRM governing board on May 7 to fund new stem cell research facilities at 12 institutions. UCSC has now received a total of more than $16 million from CIRM in funding for new facilities and grants for individual researchers. </p><p>The UCSC stem cell program brings together a diverse group of researchers with expertise in areas ranging from genetics and neurobiology to bioinformatics and new engineering technologies. Their research focuses on basic stem cell biology and the development of new techniques for studying and using stem cells. These studies have potential clinical applications for treating conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and certain heart diseases and cancers.</p><p>"It's not just our faculty and their students who will benefit from this funding--these resources will allow innovative attacks on some of the most serious diseases that impact our citizens," Margon said.</p><p>The research program involves faculty and students from two departments in the Baskin School of Engineering and three departments in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. The program builds on UCSC's existing strengths in several specialized areas that have great promise for advancing the field of stem cell research, said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences. </p><p>"I am very excited about our unique interdisciplinary approach to stem cell research at UCSC, which the scientific reviewers at CIRM said was 'outstanding' and 'vibrant,'" Thorsett said. "They noted that our work in bioinformatics and genomics is a core strength not just for California, but internationally, and they were intrigued by the way we will bring astronomers, biologists, and engineers together to develop the next generation of microscopes for stem cell work. This new grant will allow us to continue to build exceptional research and training programs at UCSC in a field with fundamental importance to our understanding of human health and disease."</p><p>The new center will include laboratory space for six UCSC faculty involved in stem cell research and will support a much larger number of scientists by providing a core area with laboratory instruments required for their research, such as microscopy and tissue culture rooms. The additional lab space will also allow the campus to hire new faculty members interested in pursuing stem cell research and will support additional research by undergraduate and graduate students. </p><p>"This funding is a big step forward in helping us attract more bright, young researchers, and it allows us to significantly ramp up our efforts in stem cell engineering," said Michael Isaacson, acting dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. </p><p>The new facilities, which will occupy the fourth floor of the planned Biomedical Sciences Building, will more than double the amount of laboratory space dedicated to stem cell research at UCSC. "We envision this facility serving as a hub for stem cell research on campus," said Ann Pace, associate director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. </p><p>A $2.7 million CIRM grant in June 2007 funded a Shared Stem Cell Facility in the nearby Sinsheimer Laboratories Building, which provides cell culture rooms and other core facilities for stem cell research and training. Due to federal policies restricting the stem cell lines that can be studied in federally funded labs, the CIRM-funded facilities are the only sites where UCSC researchers can use the full range of human embryonic stem cell lines. </p><p>Stem cell researchers at UCSC are pursuing a variety of projects, including the following:</p><p> . UCSC bioinformatics experts plan to create a web-based interactive browser that will integrate genomic data from stem cell research and make it available to all CIRM-funded labs in California.</p><p> .

<p>Under this policy, the University compensates eligible employees for the difference between their University base pay and military pay and allowances until the end of the employee's active military duty or until June 30, 2008, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The University also continues to pay the UC contribution to employee's health premiums while they receive their supplement to military pay, subject to a two-year lifetime limit that went into effect on September 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Employees not eligible for supplemental pay because their military pay and allowances exceed their University wages may elect to continue their health plan coverage while on military leave and the University will continue to pay the UC contribution to those plans.</p>
<p>Eligible employees under this policy are those who serve on active military duty during Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Iraqi Freedom or any other campaign in connection with the national state of emergency declared in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
<p>It is the University's desire to assist, to the extent possible, employees who are called to active duty during these campaigns. Therefore, the University has proposed that the Policy be renewed for a two-year period, effective July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2010. Benefits provided under this renewal continue to be subject to a two-year lifetime limit.</p>

(Photo by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC aims to be a leader in "green" energy and sustainable practices, according to Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>The chancellor listed several ways the campus is working to accomplish that goal at last week's Spring Open Forum, in addition to answering questions from staff about contracts, salaries, the state budget, long-term plans, and more.</p>
<p>On the environmental front, Blumenthal said, "We're greener than ever--but not with envy."</p>
<p>The campus has:</p>

<ul>
<li>Released a sustainability report that showed, among other achievements, that water consumption per capita on campus has fallen 40 percent since the 1980s;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Been identified for the second year in a row by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the sixth-largest campus purchaser of "green power" in the country;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Made progress in reducing car trips to campus, using programs such as vanpools, bike shuttles, and the Zipcar car-sharing service. Zipcar recently ranked the UCSC program as the most well-utilized and fastest-growing car-share of any of its university programs in the nation;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Added a new bike shuttle that leaves from University Inn &amp; Conference Center.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"All of these measures are aimed at reducing our carbon footprint on campus," said the chancellor.</p>
<p>Blumenthal also updated the 200 or so staff members who attended the forum on various campus achievements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Faculty members Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, have been elected to internationally renowned academic societies.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>UCSC acquired the complete archives of the Grateful Dead, to be housed in Special Collections at McHenry Library. "This was really a coup for the campus," said Blumenthal, noting that both UC Berkeley and Stanford University had also vied for the collection. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Phase I of Ranch View Terrace is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, with 45 homes to be finished between September and December. Forty-two of those residences have deposits on them, said Blumenthal.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>With the upcoming change of command at the top--new UC president-designate Mark Yudof starts work June 16--Blumenthal said he anticipates a number of changes. The president will likely make state-government relations a priority, he said, devoting time to interacting with the legislature, particularly on budget issues.</p>
<p>UC faces significant cuts in the governor's proposed 2008-09 budget, which falls $417 million short of the amount requested by the UC Regents to fund enrollments, pressing program needs, and salary needs.</p>
<p>The revised state budget is due out May 14. Though he is not sure yet what specific effect the budget cuts will have on UCSC, "we as a campus are undoubtedly going to face some difficult and painful choices," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Members of the AFSCME service unit again attended the forum and implored Blumenthal to help them attain a new contract with better wages.</p>
<p>"I certainly agree all of you should be paid an appropriate wage," Blumenthal said. "I believe in that. I do not have the power to give you a contract, but I do have the power to advocate for appropriate wages for all workers."</p>
<p>UC's president and the Board of Regents are the decision-makers on contracts, said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Other questions from staff covered topics including UC's long-term planning and whether merit raises will keep up with inflation.</p>
<p>Another question, submitted anonymously via email, noted the irony of welcoming the archives of the Grateful Dead--a band often associated with the drug culture--while repudiating the recent "4/20" marijuana-celebration event, in which thousands of people around the nation converge in open areas such as UC Santa Cruz to communally smoke marijuana in an expression of support for the reform of marijuana laws.</p>
<p>Officials sent out an email message before the event saying the University did not condone, support, or otherwise sanction the event. They also closed or restricted campus entrances, restricted parking, and halted bus and shuttle service on campus that weekend.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, the Grateful Dead is not contrary to state law; smoking marijuana is contrary to state law," Blumenthal said in response to the question.</p>
<p>"The Grateful Dead archive is an academically important part of our library," he continued. "I see it contributing to the academic mission of our university. People smoking pot on the Porter College lawn are not."</p>
<p>The Spring Open Forum was the last forum for the 2007-08 academic year.</p>

Miller Award for Student Journalists" by the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>.</p>
<p>Laird received the $2,500 prize for three articles he had published last year in UCSC's weekly student newspaper, <em>City on a Hill</em>.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of great student journalists out there--even just at UCSC alone--so to get recognized like that is pretty flattering," said Laird by e-mail from Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>
<p>Laird left for South America in January with a one-way ticket en route to an internship at a bilingual newspaper in Quito, Ecuador. Two weeks later, the paper went bankrupt. Laird decided to make the best of a bad situation and proceeded to travel through Ecuador and write for an online travel guide. He later dipped into his savings to continue traveling in Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>"The whole situation taught me a lot about what is possible in the world if you force yourself outside your comfort zones and are willing to take that step into the unknown," said Laird.</p>
<p>Laird noted that the day after he found out about the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> award, he was surprised by an e-mail from Susan Watrous, faculty advisor for UCSC's <em>City on a Hill</em>, who notified him that he had also just been recognized with a Columbia Scholastic Press Association Certificate of Merit for News Feature Writing.</p>
<p>"<em>City on a Hill</em> was the best thing that ever happened to me academically at UCSC," Laird observed. "I had no journalism experience prior to my senior year when I first started there. But thanks to Susan Watrous and all of the amazing students who work for the paper, I was able to really get a chance to learn a lot and develop as a writer and journalist after basically starting from scratch."</p>
<p>Laird received his <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> award for three articles he wrote that dealt with public policy issues that were of major interest to residents of Santa Cruz. He noted that his recent honors should help with his future career plans.</p>
<p>"I'd definitely like to pursue a career as a journalist," said Laird. "I think my ideal situation would be to end up at some sort of news magazine where you get a chance to really get deep into public policy and other issues that have huge effects on real people's everyday lives."</p>

<p>She is one of 22 filmmakers and media artists who received a total of $715,000 from the organization in recognition of artistic excellence. The award is given to filmmakers and media artists "whose work is innovative, creative, and pushes boundaries."</p>
<p>"These 22 artists represent some of the most talented and forward-thinking artists creating independent media today" noted Jane Rosenthal, co-chair of the Tribeca Film Institute. "We look forward to their lasting and substantial contribution to independent film and arts."</p>
<p>The TFI Fellowship program was founded and is supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. It offers financial support for artists working in the narrative, documentary, experimental, installation and computer-generated media genres. Daniel received a cash award of $35,000.</p>
<p>Last year Daniel was named an Official Honoree in the Activism category at the 11th annual Webby Awards. Described as the "Oscars of the Internet" by the <em>New York Times</em>, the Webby Awards are the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet.</p>

<p>Daniel's work has involved collaborations with disenfranchised communities--collecting their stories and building online interfaces that make this information available across social, economic and cultural boundaries. Her goal is to not attempt to speak for others, but instead to allow them to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Daniel's work has been exhibited internationally at numerous museums and festivals including the Corcoran Biennial, Ars Electronica and the Lincoln Center Festival. She joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1996, and currently teaches classes in digital media theory and practice.</p>

<p>So instead of biking all the way up the notoriously brutal-on-bicyclists hill that leads to UC Santa Cruz, the grad student and teacher's assistant pedaled to the University Inn &amp; Conference Center on Ocean Street. He loaded his mountain bike onto a rack pulled by a van and hopped into the shuttle for a morning ride up to campus.</p>
<p>UCSC's newest bike shuttle location at University Inn-joining three others that pick up riders at Longs Drugs on Mission Street--started April 14.</p>
<p>"It's awesome," said Shanbrom of the free service for UCSC affiliates. "This is really convenient and fast. And good for days when you're late or lazy or sick-or all three."</p>
<p>With the 21st annual <a href="http://www.bike2work.com/s_cruz/">Santa Cruz County Bike Week</a> happening May 10-17, more county residents and UCSC staff, faculty, and students may be joining Shanbrom in finding alternate ways of getting around town.</p>
<p>Though the whole week is Bike Week--a program of nonprofit environmental consultancy Ecology Action--May 15 is Bike to Work/School Day, a communitywide effort providing public education and incentives to promote bike commuting.</p>
<p>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services is a Bike Week sponsor, and has been a supporter during most of the event's two-decade-plus history, according to Larry Pageler, TAPS director.</p>
<p>Begun in 1988 with a few hundred participants, Bike to Work/School Day last year drew 9,600 pedalers, an increase of 24 percent over the year before, according to Piet Canin, Ecology Action transportation division program director. Two-thirds of that participation came from schools, from elementary through high school.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Canin's sister, KT Canin, started Santa Cruz's Bike Week as her community studies project while she was at UCSC, said Canin. KT visited Boulder, Colo., one summer, saw their Bike to Work program, and wanted to try it here.</p>
<p>"It was probably one of first Bike to Work programs in California," he said.</p>
<p>The reason for the increased participation in Bike to Work/School day last year likely stems from several factors, said Canin.</p>
<p>"I think it's a combination of the environment and climate changes plus rising gas prices," he said. "Also it's a healthy way to commute, and we're in an area where it's relatively easy to commute by bicycle."</p>
<p>For UCSC staffer Robert Sellers, who was also catching a shuttle ride from University Inn on a recent morning, part of the incentive was the cost of buying a parking permit on campus. An "A" permit for faculty and staff costs nearly $800 per year.</p>
<p>"I couldn't justify driving my car," said Sellers, who also rides an electric bike to campus two to three times a week.</p>
<p>He hopes more people join the alternative transportation trend, whether it be bicycling and shuttling, carpooling, or something else.</p>
<p>"If people can realize how easy it is not to drive, maybe they'll take a chance and try something different," Sellers said.</p>
<p>UCSC does have that long hill climb, "and that's a challenge," said Canin. "But considering the hill there's a good amount of bike ridership at UCSC, and there's a pretty good bike culture up there, too."</p>
<p>So far this spring quarter, UCSC's bike shuttles are carrying an average of 170 riders per day, a 14 percent increase over last spring's ridership, according to Pageler. The increase comes both from larger shuttles and the new route from the University Inn, he said. In its first four weeks of service, the University Inn shuttle averaged about 25 riders per day, or about 9-10 riders per trip.</p>
<p>TAPS thinks bike ridership to campus increases during Bike Week, but accurate counts are often difficult to obtain, said Pageler.</p>
<p>"Campus bike commuters arrive via numerous routes, including Cardiff Drive (past the Women's Center), and dirt paths near the arboretum, as well as through the main and west entrances," he said.</p>
<p>But he's happy when he sees bike commuters using the shuttles to get up the hill to campus.</p>
<p>"When they're on a bike, they're probably releasing a parking space or a seat on a crowded bus for another campus commuter--at the same time they're getting some healthy exercise and enjoying the Santa Cruz environment," Pageler said.</p>
<p>Both Pageler and Canin emphasized bicycle safety. Two bicyclists have died in traffic accidents at the intersection of Mission and Bay streets during the past year.</p>
<p>"Bicycling is a great environmental, personal health, and economic way of traveling, but you have to be conscious of safety concerns on a bicycle, such as following safety rules of the road and making yourself visible and predictable to motorists," said Canin.</p>
<p>Concerns about bike safety along Mission Street have prompted TAPS to work with local bike advocates and the City of Santa Cruz to identify safe routes to the bike shuttle pick-up point at Longs Drugs, as well as to campus.</p>
<p>"We'll be posting maps of those routes in the bike shuttles and on the TAPS web site shortly," Pageler said.</p>

Called "The Banana Slug Salto," the event brought 12 men and 16 women gymnasts from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Oregon State, and San Francisco City College to compete in Santa Cruz.</p><p>The UCSC men's team took the first-place trophy, and the women took second. For some athletes on the team who had recently started gymnastics this was their first competition.</p><p>Josh Smith earned first-place medals in rings, vault, and all-around. David Allen edged past Smith on the pommel horse and high bar. Newcomer Zachary Shiner showed some serious altitude on floor to earn third place. Ryan Brenner earned fifth place on pommel horse. UCSC staff member Kenneth Garges made fourth place on high bar. </p><p>Allison Valladao earned a second-place finish on beam and floor and third on vault and uneven bars. Her consistent performance earned her first all around. Jenna Yamaguma, the Slug gymnasts' communications officer, vaulted into second and made fourth on uneven bars and third all around. Amanda Valone earned fifth place on balance beam.</p><p>Although this was the first time the UCSC club had hosted a meet, most felt it was well organized and ran smoothly. All the club's efforts since its inception just one year ago, including raising funds for gym rental, management, and judges fees, made for a well-received event. </p><p>With two women's and one men's events happening simultaneously, there was always something to watch. A local dance troop led by T. T. Hoffman performed aerial dance high above the floor to entertain the crowd while scores were tabulated. A computer glitch did make for some laughs when Pat Pope, a guy, was mistakenly awarded a medal for a women's event, but the awards were quickly corrected.</p><p>The meet was held at Santa Cruz Sports Central near campus. Prizes and chocolate banana slugs for all athletes were donated by Bay Tree Bookstore.</p><p>Information about the College Gymnastics Club and photos from the Banana Slug Salto can be found at <a href="http://www.sluggymnastics.com">www.sluggymnastics.com</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156bea08072704601a012ff0235dd3a"><name>2201</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Offensive Graffiti found on Campus</title><start-date>1210316400000</start-date><display-name>Offensive Graffiti found on...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2201</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2201</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338635352</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338635352</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Recently, unfortunate incidents have occurred on our UCSC campus.

<p>The five-year grant supports a UCSC research program called MEGAMER (Microbial Environmental Genomics Applications: Modeling, Experimentation, and Remote sensing), established in July 2005 with a $2.2 million award from the Moore Foundation. Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences and principal investigator on the new grant, oversaw the establishment of MEGAMER.</p>
<p>Research in the MEGAMER labs focuses on studying and monitoring microorganisms in the ocean, particularly in the waters of Monterey Bay. The oceans swarm with tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye, but so abundant and diverse that they affect the global environment in surprising ways. By controlling the biological, geological, chemical and physical processes that influence the natural environment, marine microbes affect the global climate and help maintain ocean fertility, Zehr said.</p>
<p>"When people think about microorganisms, they usually think about pathogens and disease-causing bacteria," he said. "And when they think about ocean health, whales and seals come to mind first. But it's the natural microorganisms that don't cause disease that are the most important in the oceans."</p>
<p>Zehr and his colleagues are primarily interested in understanding how the diversity of marine microorganisms affects the global environment. These microbes play a key role in ocean processes and will help determine how global climate change affects the oceans in the future.</p>
<p>The researchers are also studying how ocean dynamics control the structure and function of microbial communities, which are poorly understood due to the difficulty of monitoring microbes in the oceans. New "remote instrumentation" technologies will allow the researchers to sample the oceans from fixed, autonomous ocean observatories. Biological sensors, or probes, are a key component of this technology, which Zehr has been working on with Christopher Scholin, a molecular biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).</p>
<p>Scholin developed the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), an instrument capable of detecting genes in the ocean and radioing information back to shore without human assistance. Initially developed to detect harmful algal blooms, the ESP "essentially put in place the instrumentation allowing us to do molecular biology at sea," Zehr said. He and Scholin have designed sensors for the ESP that will detect and monitor microbes involved in important ocean processes. One such process is nitrogen fixation, whereby certain marine microorganisms convert nitrogen gas into a form that can be used by other organisms, thus helping to "fertilize" the oceans. Zehr has made key discoveries in this area.</p>
<p>Some of the probes being developed by Zehr and Scholin will use a new module that amplifies detected microbial genes on the spot through a process called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a powerful technique widely used in molecular biology laboratories, and the upgraded version of the ESP will be able to do it autonomously.</p>
<p>"It can hang in the ocean and do real-time PCR at sea," Zehr said. "This is just the tip of technological development. If we can do this, there's really nothing stopping us from making instruments to detect any of the many organisms that are key in controlling the habitability of this planet."</p>
<p>But it's not just a matter of designing and implementing these molecular biology probes. Mathematical modeling of microbial population dynamics is also necessary, and the grant will fund several UCSC ocean scientists working on this arm of marine microbiology research.</p>
<p>"Oceans are big and very dynamic, so if you're going to sample something, you need to know when and where to sample it in order to obtain useful information," Zehr said.</p>
<p>For example, a map of surface chlorophyll content in Monterey Bay is never static. Water comes up from the deep ocean, or washes in from offshore, and these movements are constantly changing.</p>
<p>"If you take a sample at one point in time in Monterey Bay, an hour later it may be very different there because the waters in that position will change," Zehr explained. "So if you have a way to model how water moves and how the temperature changes, then you can predict how a microorganism and its activity will be distributed."</p>
<p>Christopher Edwards, assistant professor of ocean sciences, is one of the MEGAMER collaborators involved in designing mathematical models that account for how ocean productivity varies with factors such as light availability, temperature, and nutrients.</p>
<p>"People are much more familiar with weather forecast models, but what we do is really very similar," Edwards observed. "Instead of representing atmospheric winds and precipitation, our models represent ocean currents and the underlying changes to the ecosystem as plankton grow, are consumed or die, and decay."</p>
<p>Edwards works closely with Raphael Kudela, associate professor of ocean sciences, and Andrew Moore, professor of ocean sciences, both of whom will also receive funding from the new grant. Together, they have developed several models of nitrogen-fixing microbes and other microorganisms in the oceans. The researchers have also applied these ideas to a new model that simulates the complexity of ocean biological communities.</p>
<p>"Though the ocean looks pretty uniform from the surface, there are enormous differences underneath," said Edwards. "In nature, different sets of organisms thrive in different regions. By representing this biological diversity in our model, we hope to understand better how marine microbes influence ocean productivity."</p>
<p>MEGAMER will also continue to be an important contributor to ongoing research at the Center for Microbial Oceanography Research and Education (C-MORE), Zehr said. C-MORE, established by the National Science Foundation and based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, is an interdisciplinary science and technology center with six partner institutions, including UCSC.</p>
<p>"We're helping to develop remote instrumentation for studying microbial processes at C-MORE," Zehr said. "Obviously, microorganisms in the Central Pacific are very different from the ones here in Monterey Bay, which means coming up with different tools for different processes."</p>
<p>Zehr and colleagues are hoping to get the new probes they have developed into the ocean as soon as possible, before moving on to produce many more of these molecular biology sensors. "Now that we've figured out how to put a probe in place, we can work with collaborators around the country-even around the world-who are experts in different types of probes. We can help develop their probes to be placed on an instrument like the ESP," he said.</p>
<p>Current probes are focused on a few types of marine microorganisms, but the long-term vision, Zehr said, is to develop sensors with the ability to detect many different types of microorganisms simultaneously.</p>
<p>"It's the normal microflora of the oceans that are really important in ocean control," he said. "You could take the whales and the seals out, and the oceans would still be controlling the planet's biogeochemistry."</p>

The average person spends more on health care than any other personal expenditure, including housing. He argued that we have to become more efficient. There isn't a consistency among hospitals, especially the delivery. He noted that the biggest issue is waste; we are spending too much on unnecessary procedures. If we could save on these procedures we could save on the cost of health care. He continued by saying not enough is spent on inoculations and preventative measures. People could be educated on procedure and be more able to choose lower cost procedures. </p><p>Paul Tang talked about the looming crisis -- the needs of the baby boomers and the requirements of a medical workforce for an aging America. He said the bottom line is we don't just need more doctors and nurses; we need to drop out time from the health care process, so the patient is helped that much faster. Information couriers should not be involved as much, but methods for getting direct information to the patient need to be developed. He demonstrated an online health care resource for patients with chronic diseases, involving monitoring and feedback via the internet.</p><p>Danny Sands discussed how we could increase efficiency or reduce waste. He said we need to move toward the idea that information is important. We need to transform the data so that doctors can better help their patients by delivering the right information to the right person at the right time -- that is, clinical support. Expert networks are being developed to help communicate to patients on-line. There are links that enable users to get answers from experts. He said, an hour out of every day, nurses and doctors in hospitals are trying to find people; 20 billion dollars are wasted because of communication inefficiencies. What is being looked at currently is the best means to go wireless to cut these wastes.</p><p>What is the future of health care management? All were in agreement. It's engaging the people to have a concern for their own health. It's getting electronic comprehensive patient records in use with physicians. Danny Sands thinks the general practitioner seems to really like it. Employers are ultimately responsible for the health of their patients. And it's not just health care. It is a continuous attention to your health. </p><p>UCSC Professor Nirvikar Singh, special advisor to the chancellor for Silicon Valley Management Education, summarized from this discussion the conclusion that health care is a large and pressing issue, with many dimensions. He ended optimistically with the view that, with all the brilliant minds in the Silicon Valley we'll be able to tap these intellectual resources to improve the management of health care.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156c62b8072704601a012ffb86c1cd7"><name>2206</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Advisory Board Ballot</title><start-date>1210748400000</start-date><display-name>Staff Advisory Board Ballot...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2206</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2206</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338637309</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338637309</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We need your vote!</p>

"Most girls have experienced all three types of sexism--sexual harassment, sexist comments about their academic abilities, and sexist comments about their athletic abilities." </p><p>Sexual harassment included receiving inappropriate and unwanted romantic attention, hearing demeaning gender-related comments, being teased about their appearance, receiving unwanted physical contact, and being teased, bullied, or threatened with harm by a male. "Our findings on sexual harassment are, sadly, consistent with previous research," said Leaper. "But on the other hand, most girls said they'd experienced sexual harassment at least once, as opposed to several times."</p><p>Girls also commonly reported having received discouraging comments about their abilities because of their gender. In particular, 76 percent of girls said they had received discouraging comments about their abilities in sports, and 52 percent said they'd received discouraging comments related to their abilities in science, math, or computers--three areas Leaper focused on because of the persistent gender gap in academics. </p><p>"In all cases, the most common sources of discouraging comments were their male peers, which is both understandable and sad," said Leaper, noting that parents, teachers, and coaches also convey such comments.</p><p>As grim as the findings appear, Leaper said the frequency of discouraging incidents may be decreasing, compared to the experiences of girls 30 years ago. "It may be that these girls are experiencing isolated incidents that occur here and there," said Leaper. "The fact that there are more girls in sports and math and science today than 30 years ago suggests there are fewer barriers than there were in the past."</p><p>Leaper's study was the first to try to identify the factors that predict whether girls will recognize their experiences as sexism. Recognizing when sexism occurs is a crucial first step toward overcoming discrimination, according to Leaper. "Otherwise, it is more likely that individuals attribute failure to their lack of ability rather than to the obstacles in their environment," he said.</p><p>Older girls and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds reported more sexism than their peers, and Latina and Asian American girls reported less sexual harassment than girls from other ethnic groups, according to the study. Moreover, girls who had learned about feminism through the media or from people in their lives, including mothers and teachers, were more likely to recognize it than girls who had never heard about feminism, and girls who felt pressure from parents to conform to gender stereotypes perceived more sexism than other girls.</p><p>"The more girls feel encouraged to adopt traditional gender roles, the more sensitive they are to sexism," said Leaper, who likened sensitivity to sexism to awareness of racism. "In order to recognize sexism, you probably have to believe it's wrong."</p><p>But being aware of sexism doesn't predispose girls to overreport it, noted Leaper.</p><p>"We know from previous studies that people tend to underreport discrimination," said Leaper. "After Anita Hill, reports of sexual harassment increased dramatically in the United States, because it gave people a label for their experience. So, if anything, sexism is probably occurring more than the girls in this study are saying it is. Our research suggests that parents, teachers, and the media can help girls to learn about discrimination and recognize when it occurs."</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Campbell Leaper may be reached by contacting Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495 or jmcnulty@ucsc.edu.

"Receiving this honor in Belgium has particular resonance for me since I was born there." </p><p>Van Den Abbeele was selected for the honor "in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the rethinking of human and social studies in a contemporary context, including philosophy, anthropology and the impact of cognitive studies on the 'digital divide.'

Suki maintained the gardens and grounds at Engineering II, Baskin Engineering, the Core West landscape, Physical Science Building, Sinsheimer and Thimann Labs, and Thimann Lecture Hall. Suki was well known and her work widely appreciated, especially on Science Hill. In fact, she tended the campus grounds with such care that she made the hard work seem so natural and peaceful.</p><p>Suki began her career with Physical Plant in September 2000. Prior to working with Physical Plant, she worked as a grounds keeper for Family Student Housing while a student at UCSC. Suki graduated from Porter College in 1999 with a degree in Digital Media.</p><p>Before coming to Santa Cruz, Suki also earned a degree in music performance from the North Carolina School of the Arts. She became an accomplished musician, teaching flute and producing music CDs that she and her husband recorded.</p><p>Suki is survived by her husband, Christopher, also a University employee, and son, Cyrus Abu-Saba.</p><p>Remembrances will be held for the local community on Sunday, May 25, from noon to 4 p.m. at 408 Lincoln Street in Santa Cruz.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Ilse Kolbus, Director of Physical Plant</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156cea18072704601a012ffa91dafba"><name>2212</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Thirty-Meter Telescope focuses on two candidate sites</title><summary>After completing a worldwide survey of astronomical sites for the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT), the TMT Observatory Corporation board of directors has selected two outstanding sites, one in each hemisphere, for further consideration.</summary><author>Sandra Dawson, (626) 395-1619, sdawson@tmt.org; Tim Stephens, (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Thirty-Meter Telescope, Thirty Meter Telescope, TMT</keywords><description>After completing a worldwide survey of astronomical sites for the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT), the TMT Observatory Corporation board of directors has selected two outstanding sites, one in each hemisphere, for further consideration.</description><start-date>1210834800000</start-date><display-name>Thirty-Meter Telescope focuses on...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2212</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2212</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338639465</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338639465</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/nelson_bolte.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/nelson_bolte.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nelson_bolte.jpg</name><file-size>31157</file-size><width>348</width><height>211</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jerry Nelson (left) is the project scientist for the Thirty-Meter Telescope and Michael Bolte (right), director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, serves on the TMT Science Advisory Committee.

Cerro Armazones lies in Chile's Atacama Desert, and Mauna Kea is on Hawaii Island.</p><p>The TMT observatory, which will be capable of peering back in space and time to the era when the first stars and galaxies were forming and will be able to directly image planets orbiting other stars, will herald a new generation of telescopes.</p><p>To ensure that proposed TMT sites would provide the greatest advantage to the telescope's capabilities, a global satellite survey was conducted, from which a small sample of outstanding sites was chosen for further study using ground-based test equipment. This ground-based study of two sites in the northern hemisphere and three in the southern was the most comprehensive survey of its kind ever undertaken.</p><p>Atmospheric turbulence above each candidate site, and wind characteristics, temperature variations, amount of water vapor, and other meteorological data at some of the candidate sites, were continuously monitored for up to four years.  Based upon this campaign, the TMT project will now further evaluate the best site in the northern hemisphere and the best site in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>"All five sites proved to be outstanding for carrying out astronomical observations," said Edward Stone, Caltech's Morrisroe Professor of Physics and vice chairman of the TMT board. "I want to congratulate the TMT project team for conducting an excellent testing program, not only for TMT but for the benefit of astronomical research in the future." In addition to the "astronomical weather" at the sites, other considerations in the final selection will include the environment, accessibility, operations costs, and complementarities with other nearby astronomy facilities.</p><p>The next step in the site analysis process is the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that will thoroughly evaluate all aspects, including environmental, cultural, socio-economic, and financial, of constructing and operating the Thirty-Meter Telescope in Hawaii.  An environmental impact statement for Cerro Armazones has already been completed and submitted to the Chilean government for their review. </p><p>The community-based Mauna Kea Management Board, which oversees the management of the Mauna Kea summit in coordination with the University of Hawai'i at Hilo, concurs that the Thirty-Meter Telescope should proceed with its EIS process. Regardless of whether Mauna Kea is selected as the Thirty Meter Telescope site, information generated from the EIS will be useful in the management of Mauna Kea.</p><p>Henry Yang, TMT board chair and chancellor of UC Santa Barbara, expressed the gratitude of the board. "The selection of these top two candidate sites is an exciting milestone in the Thirty-Meter Telescope's journey from vision to reality. We are grateful for the tireless efforts of our project team and the tremendous vision and support of the Moore Foundation and our international partners that have brought us to this point. We look forward to moving ahead rapidly and with all due diligence toward the selection of our preferred site."</p><p>The TMT is currently in the final stages of an $80 million design phase. The plan is to initiate construction in 2010 with first light in early 2018. This project is a partnership between the University of California, California Institute of Technology, and ACURA, an organization of Canadian universities. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has provided $50 million for the design phase of the project and has pledged an additional $200 million for the construction of the telescope, and Caltech and the University of California each will seek to raise matching funds of $50 million to bring the construction total to $300 million.</p><p>"We look forward to the discussions with the people of Hawaii and Chile regarding the opportunities to open a new era in astronomy in one of these two world capitals of astronomy," says Professor Ray Carlberg, the Canadian Large Optical Telescope project director and a TMT board member. "Canadian scientists have partnered in the extensive site testing carried out by TMT and we are very pleased to see that it has led to two great options for TMT."</p><p>TMT gratefully acknowledges support for design and development from the following: Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; National Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund; Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy; and the National Science Foundation (USA).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156d0398072704601a012ff49a90079"><name>2213</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz awarded $700,000 challenge grant from Kresge Foundation for McHenry Library construction</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded a $700,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation toward the construction and modernization of McHenry Library.</summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Library, grant, McHenry, Kresge Foundation, fundraising, construction</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded a $700,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation toward the construction and modernization of McHenry Library.</description><start-date>1211353200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz awarded...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2213</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2213</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338639854</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338639854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/library.addition.lobby_225.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/library.addition.lobby_225.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>library.addition.lobby_225.jpg</name><file-size>50552</file-size><width>225</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lobby view of the new McHenry Library addition</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded a $700,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation toward the construction and modernization of McHenry Library.</p>
<p>The Library will have to raise $3.2 million over the next 18 months for the gift to come to the campus. The grant is designed on a challenge basis to support the McHenry Library Expansion and Renovation capital campaign. It is intended to assist UCSC in raising the balance required to complete its campaign goal and the funding of the project.</p>
<p>The Library has already raised $4.8 million-more than half of its total goal of $8 million in its fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>"This is an amazing opportunity to help us raise the funds we need to totally transform McHenry Library and make it a 21st century destination for a new generation of library users," said University Librarian Ginny Steel.</p>
<p>She added that in awarding the challenge grant, the Kresge Foundation lauded UCSC for providing "access to students of color and those from low-income and working class families," as well as "leadership in environmentally sustainable practices throughout your campus."</p>
<p>The Kresge Foundation is a private organization that supports communities by building the capacity of nonprofit organizations in the fields of health, the environment, arts and culture, education, human services and community development. Last year, the foundation awarded 442 grants throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa, totaling $178 million.</p>
<p>Private support must be found for all aspects of UCSC's library project not covered by state funding. This includes such amenities as the planned Global Village Cyber CafÃ© <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=1028">see Currents story</a>, the reading lawn and gardens, new furniture, information technology, media equipment, and public art for the building.</p>
<p>"The Kresge Foundation challenges us a community to come together in support of this project and put our combined resources behind the expansion and renovation of UCSC's landmark McHenry Library," said Steel.</p>

(Photo by Scott Rappaport)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Fourteen graduate students from UC Santa Cruz's innovative Digital Arts and New Media MFA Program (DANM) will exhibit their work at the "2nd Biennial O1SJ Global Festival of Art on the Edge," June 4-8 in San Jose.</p>
<p>UCSC's "Bureau of Disruptions" exhibit will join more than 100 other projects on display throughout the parks, museums, theaters and streets of the city's downtown area. Exhibitions at the festival will range from a hip-hop, multimedia meditation on Antarctica, to robot art, to operatic performances of Google headlines about the environment.</p>
<p>"This event provides a really wonderful opportunity for students because the festival is dedicated exclusively to the most cutting-edge and socially activated engagements with technology," noted DANM faculty member Soraya Murray, curator of the UCSC exhibit. "It provides an excellent venue for them to showcase their very impressive approaches to the use of technology."</p>
<p>Murray explained that the project is titled "Bureau of Disruptions" because the students wanted to disrupt expected notions about a wide variety of subjects.</p>
<p>For example, Michael Treanor has designed an alternative interactive game titled "Reflect" that places the viewer in the perspective of other living creatures; the player starts out as a worm and goes up the food chain, eventually ending up as a human."As opposed to a typical violent or distracting game, his project inspires reflective, calm, dispassionate interaction," Murray noted.</p>
<p>Another UCSC student, Will Justice, will present "The Human Morality Index (HMI)", a satirical pseudo-scientific web site that takes aim at our economic system, billing itself as "a real-time barometer of human moral capital."</p>
<p>"It's not just technology for technology's sake," Murray noted. "The students' use of technology is not gratuitous-it's a very forward-thinking means by which they address social problems, moral challenges, or hopes and anxieties in relation to this burgeoning technology."</p>
<p>UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media MFA program serves as a center for the development and study of digital media and the cultures they have helped create. Faculty and students are drawn from a variety of backgrounds such as the arts, sciences, computer engineering, humanities, and the social sciences to pursue interdisciplinary artistic and scholarly research.</p>
<p>The "Bureau of Disruptions" exhibit will be located at 333 West Santa Clara at the Comerica Building in downtown San Jose. The festival runs June 4-8, from noon to 6 p.m. with extended hours on Wednesday and Friday. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Collaborative student and faculty projects from UCSC's DANM program will also be on display during the festival. "Outfield"--an interactive kinetic installation made from a variety of sound-producing electromechanical objects--was developed in assistant art professor Ed Osborn's DANM Mechatronics project group and will be on exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art.</p>
<p>In addition, assistant UCSC art professor Elliot Anderson's project group has produced "Cathexispin"--a series of stationary bicycles that transform gym energy into art energy. The electricity generated by exercise will be used to power music and film performance during the festival, using analog devices and computer processing.</p>

Photo by Jeff Bury.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For residents of Peru's remote villages high in the Andes mountains, climate change is right outside the back door.</p><p>"Most of these people have lived beneath these glaciers their entire lives," said geographer Jeffrey Bury, an assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC. "They can point to where the glacier was when they were children, and now the ice is disappearing. They've watched it move their entire lives."</p><p>As the world's highest and most glaciated tropical mountain range, the central Andes have the unfortunate distinction of being at the forefront of global warming. In Peru, residents are already coping with unpredictable seasons and weather extremes that make it hard to know when to plant their crops and graze their animals, said Bury.</p><p>"Tropical glaciers are very near the equator at elevations up to 20,000 feet," said Bury. "If you look at Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the ice cap is almost gone."</p><p>This summer, Bury and graduate student Adam French will spend eight weeks in the central Peruvian Andes, known as the <i>Cordillera Blanca</i> or "white corridor," as part of an interdisciplinary team of scholars investigating glacial recession. Bury's team will interview residents of several remote mountain communities to understand how changes in water availability are affecting their livelihoods, while colleagues from the Byrd Polar Center at Ohio State University and McGill University will evaluate glacial volume and hydrological fluctuations.</p><p>"Scientists have documented glacial recession in the central Andes since the early 1900s, but glaciers are melting faster than anyone anticipated," said Bury. "Many glaciers are almost gone, and water levels in the valleys below are changing. We're seeing very clear impacts in the region that are likely to foster more intense social conflicts downstream."</p><p>Water rationing is already in effect in Lima, home to 8 million Peruvians, and Bury expects the impacts of climate change to intensify, in part because the entire western shelf of Latin America is a desert that has been transformed by vast irrigation networks and hydroelectric projects. As the glaciers disappear and water becomes less plentiful, disputes over water ownership and use are inevitable, he predicted.</p><p>For residents of remote mountain villages, glacial melt provides water for consumption, livestock, and sanitation. As the glaciers disappear, residents are being forced to adapt, he said. "People are really noticing this in their lives already," said Bury, who speaks fluent Spanish. "They have enough to drink, but it's affecting agriculture, grazing, lake levels, and fish in the river. They're concerned." Weather extremes related to climate change, including unseasonable hail storms, sudden freezes, and dry spells that destroy crops, make people quite vulnerable, he added.</p><p>Bury has worked in Peru for more than a decade, including several years spent evaluating the impacts of new mining operations, ecotourism, and conservation efforts in the remote <i>Cordillera Huayhuash</i> (pronounced "why-wash"). This summer, Bury and French will concentrate their time in three small communities near the regional capital of Huaraz. Part of separate watersheds, each village is home to several hundred people who live on the border of the ice. Bury's goal is to interview residents of 75 households over the next two years, building on preliminary work his team began last summer. </p><p>"We know a lot about the ice and snow," said Bury. "But we know a lot less about how human populations are going to respond to these changes--or are already responding. It's a really challenging conversation, because the adaptations are very political and overlain by historical inequalities."</p><p>Working at elevations above 10,000 feet adds a host of challenges, including what Bury calls "four seasons every day."</p><p>"We each wear about four layers, because in the high mountains, you get bitter cold in the morning, it's super hot mid-day, and then it's cold again at night," said Bury, an avid alpinist who jokes that he's "getting a little old for this."</p><p>"It can be taxing for everyone, including me," said Bury. "As close as we are to the equator, the sun is about as strong as it gets. I sometimes wear zinc oxide over my entire face."</p><p>With funding from the UCSC Committee on Teaching, Bury will record some of his team's field work this summer and produce "micromodules" for classroom use next fall. "It's part of bringing the field to the classroom, so we'll wear wireless microphones and will record <i>in situ</i> video lectures that will make the work accessible to more undergraduates," said Bury, a self-described technology buff.</p><p>But the work itself is "terribly important," said Bury, who is collaborating with fellow project leader Bryan Mark of Ohio State University (OSU), a geographer affiliated with OSU's Byrd Polar Research Center. With funding from the National Science Foundation and NASA, they also work closely with earth scientist Jeffrey McKenzie of McGill University, The Mountain Institute, and the American Alpine Club.</p><p>"We need this data to get a better sense of what's going on in the central Andes," said Bury. "It's very important for the people of the region and for our scientific understanding of what's happening. It also matters for the undergraduates and graduates we'll be training. I've always said the best thing an undergraduate could ever do is leave the country for a while. For those who can't manage that, we're going to bring a piece of this remote part of the world back to the classroom."</p><p>Ultimately, Bury plans to share his findings with Andean residents and with the Peruvian government to help generate policy solutions that will help Peruvians navigate the rapidly worsening impacts of climate change.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156dc828072704601a012ffc889aef4"><name>2222</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>About UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1211266800000</start-date><display-name>About UC Santa Cruz...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2222</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2222</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338643023</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338643023</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, which is renowned for the outstanding educational experience it provides to students, has earned national distinction as a major research university with an uncommon commitment to teaching and public service.</p>

This year, the big hit with falcon-watchers has been the webcam at San Jose City Hall and a pair of falcons named Carlos and Clara, who are now raising three healthy chicks in a nest box provided by researchers with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"It's a unique opportunity to see a falcon's home life," said Stewart, coordinator of the SCPBRG.</p>
<p>The webcam monitoring the San Jose nest box has averaged 18,000 visits daily since the chicks hatched on April 22. San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed and his office have been enthusiastic participants in this online reality show, issuing regular press releases with updates on the City Hall falcon family. For weeks the mayor's web site promoted a "Name That Falcon" contest for San Jose kids to name the three chicks. The City of San Jose also provides funding ($45,000 this year) to support SCPBRG's work with the falcons and its outreach programs in local schools.</p>
<p>On May 16, crowds gathered to watch along with the mayor and local media as SCPBRG researcher Brian Latta rappelled down to the nest box from the top of City Hall to place identifying bands on the legs of the chicks. He also determined that two of them were females and the third a male. One egg in the nest failed to hatch.</p>
<p>Stewart has roped in four research interns to help "drive" the webcam in San Jose--remotely operating the camera from their computers--because viewers don't want to miss any of the action going on in the nest box. The camera has spawned an online discussion group with more than 1,700 members; Stewart and other SCPBRG researchers use this group as a venue to answer questions and allay fears, since many of the members could probably rival Carlos and Clara in parental anxiety over the chicks' every move.</p>
<p>For example, many viewers aren't aware that falcon chicks look completely identical, Stewart said. "People will say, 'The one in the back isn't being fed; you have to do something.' Well, he may have been the one in the front before. Maybe he got really tanked up and wants to sleep now."</p>
<p>While the chicks are certainly cute, viewers aren't spared the grisly sight of hungry falcons feasting on their favorite prey: smaller birds. "They've even seen a parent return with prey that was still alive and twitching," said Jaime Jansen, one of Stewart's interns and a junior majoring in anthropology at UCSC. "But that's real life. People need to expect that not everything is going to be pretty."</p>
<p>In previous years, thousands of viewers watched falcons Sadie and Jimbo raise a family of chicks on top of the Oracle headquarters in Redwood City, and cheered George and Gracie's public courtship on the 33rd floor of the PG&amp;E building in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>In fact, people are still grieving over George and Gracie's disappearance, after the falcons were driven away by another pair. "People actually saw the battle taking place in the air between the falcons," Stewart said, "but I guarantee no one would ever have noticed if we hadn't let them get involved through the webcams."</p>
<p>Rather than just gaze at computer screens, many enthusiastic falcon-watchers have purchased binoculars so they can watch the birds outside, or visited other nest sites in the wild, which Stewart finds particularly gratifying.</p>
<p>"There's a guy who goes out to Pier 14 [in San Francisco] every day during his lunch hour to watch the birds," he said. "For a long time, he was watching for George and Gracie to come back. Now he reports to us about the territorial pair nesting on the Bay Bridge."</p>
<p>"For me, it's not about turning people into biologists, but getting them to pay attention to what's going on," Stewart added. "Now they're not just watching peregrines; they're also seeing the coyote, the bobcat. We're talking about a legal secretary, a draftsman, a broker--people who absolutely weren't doing this before."</p>
<p>Peregrine falcons have come a long way since 1970, when there were only two pairs left in California. At that point, DDT and other pesticides had all but driven them to extinction, causing female falcons to produce thin-shelled eggs that cracked under the weight of maternal incubation.</p>
<p>Stewart and colleagues scoured the cliffs in search of the few remaining nests, retrieved the fragile falcon eggs, and brought them back to the safety of special incubators at the SCPBRG research facility. "Dummy" eggs (courtesy of the UCSC Art Department) kept the parents on their nests until the researchers could return the successfully hatched chicks.</p>
<p>For many years, the group also bred peregrine falcons and other birds of prey in a captive-breeding facility on the UCSC campus. They released the captive-bred falcons in a "soft" release process, supplying fresh quail every day until the birds learned to hunt on their own. Although the group no longer operates its own captive-breeding facility, the researchers continue to release falcons raised in captivity into the wild. In fact, they know from the leg bands on Carlos that he is not just any tiercel (male falcon), but a captive-raised bird they released at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory in 2006.</p>
<p>Today, SCPBRG researchers estimate that there are as many as 233 falcon pairs in the state.</p>
<p>"They've reestablished most of the classic nesting places like Morro Rock; now they're going for tall buildings and bridges," Stewart said. "I've revised my description of peregrines from 'they nest on cliffs' to 'they nest on structures that dominate the landscape.' Morro Rock dominates the landscape the same way San Jose City Hall does. So there's nothing artificial about the birds in San Jose; they're a wild pair of falcons like any others."</p>
<p>Stewart calls himself a cheerleader for every pair of peregrines in California, with no favorites. Others, however, often get very attached to particular birds. For instance, a different male, Jose, was Clara's mate last year, and many people are still wondering why Carlos took his place.</p>
<p>"Things happen, and we can't get sentimental about every bird that's out there," Stewart said. Peregrines usually mate for life, and researchers have observed that, more often than not, they return to the same nests each year. "But if one doesn't show up, another will," he said. "They're not going to <em>not</em> breed."</p>
<p>Stewart conducts education and outreach programs at schools throughout central California, where he talks not only about peregrine recovery efforts, but also about his job as a wildlife biologist.</p>
<p>"I tell them about putting satellite transmitters on bald eagles, and show them pictures of biologists doing work on the Channel Islands," he said. "Pretty soon, they're convinced that it's pretty exciting work if you have a helicopter, a yacht, and a floatplane involved. It gets them away from the stereotype that a scientist is a white-coat guy in a lab with beakers. Some scientists work outside and still accomplish things that, quite honestly, change the world."</p>

It is located in NASA Research Park in the heart of California's Silicon Valley.</p><p>"Winning the NASA Group Achievement Award is quite an honor, and it is due to the outstanding efforts of many people," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. "Through their excellent work, the UARC team is helping to establish UCSC as a strong and vital presence in Silicon Valley."</p><p>In a letter announcing the award, NASA Ames Research Center director Pete Worden said, "This is one of the most prestigious awards a group can receive, and is presented to selected groups who have distinguished themselves by making outstanding contributions to the NASA mission."</p><p>The UARC conducts a wide range of long-term research tasks in support of the multidisciplinary mission of NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field in Mountain View. The research focuses primarily on information technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, computer science, aerospace operations, air-traffic management, and space and Earth sciences.</p><p>William Berry, UARC director, will accept the award on behalf of the UARC team at an Honor Awards ceremony to be held at NASA Ames on June 11. The award citation is "for outstanding performance in fundamental research and collaborations to support NASA missions."</p><p>"NASA Ames gives several group achievement awards to teams that work on specific projects, but this one is extraordinary in that the entire UARC team was named for our overall performance," Berry said. "It means that NASA views the partnership with UCSC embodied in the UARC as very successful and productive."</p><p>In announcing the award, NASA officials noted that the UARC management team has done an excellent job of staying within budget and working hard to leverage UC's capabilities to enhance performance under the terms of the UARC contract. The UARC has continued to receive an "Excellent" rating in the award-fee process since the beginning of the contract. Through the UARC's Aligned Research Program to support collaborative efforts of university faculty and NASA researchers, UC has been awarded over $2 million in research funding to date.</p><p>"The UARC team is part of a vanguard helping to enable a permanent UCSC presence in Silicon Valley," said Joseph Miller, vice provost of Silicon Valley Initiatives. "The team has worked very hard to lay the groundwork for a lasting and productive partnership with NASA Ames and our future major campus center in the NASA Research Park."</p><p>Recognition of UARC employees and subcontractors is nothing new. They have earned awards and citations in a wide range of research areas in recent years. For example, UARC employees received NASA's 2006 Software of the Year Award for an air-traffic management tool. At the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems in June 2007, a UARC research scientist received the best paper award. In May 2007, two UARC researchers received the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Software Engineering Award. UARC employees were also honored for helping firefighters battle the deadly Esperanza fire in Southern California in 2006 by providing rapid delivery of real-time data from an unmanned aerial system to the fire's command center.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Karrasch (photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In April, a campus group launched a new program for some special members of the population: veterans. </p><p>The program, called Veterans Education Team Support (VETS) and run by Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS), is for veterans returning to school. It works by peer-mentorship, in which veterans can meet with other veterans and get help navigating admission and the transition into university life. The program also offers ongoing support.</p><p>Josh Karrasch, a veteran of the U.S. Navy and a UCSC student completing his bachelor's degree in psychology and premedical requirements, is coordinating the program.</p><p>Capitola Book Café will hold a benefit event for VETS featuring Mary Tillman, author of <i>Boots on the Ground by Dusk: My Tribute to Pat Tillman,</i> on Tuesday, June 3, at 7:30 p.m. Capitola Book Café is located at 1475 41st Ave., #G, Capitola.</p><p>In response to the 9/11 attacks, Pat Tillman walked away from a multimillion-dollar NFL contract to enlist as a ranger in the U.S. Army. On April 22, 2004, he was killed in Afghanistan in what the administration and the Pentagon initially portrayed as a dramatic gun battle with the enemy. Today, despite seven investigations, five of them launched because of the family's insistence, what really happened remains fraught with contradictions.</p><p> </p><p><i>In Boots on the Ground by Dusk,</i> Mary Tillman shares the story of her son's life and the Tillman family's tenacious efforts to uncover the truth about his death.</p><p>For $35, event participants receive one copy of the book and two tickets to the event; $5 from each book/ticket package sale will be donated to the UCSC VETS program. Tickets are on sale now. For more information about the event, call the Book Café at (831) 462-4415.</p><p>VETS peer mentors are currently enrolled UCSC student veterans who want to help their fellow veterans reach their educational goals. They are trained by campus and community professionals in admissions criteria, financial aid application procedures, veterans' educational benefits, university academic requirements, and related learning and personal support services. They also are getting the chance to hone their communication and problem-solving skills, learn to recognize mental health and substance abuse issues, become informed about campus and community resources, and understand when, and how, to make appropriate referrals.</p><p> </p><p>STARS is the home base for VETS where students can drop in, call or email to connect with a peer mentor or professional STARS adviser. Peer mentors are also available for consultation and outreach to community programs and agencies that are working with veterans returning to school.  </p><p>For more information about the VETS program, call STARS at 9-4968.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156e91d8072704601a012ff35234abe"><name>2231</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>School kids take a field trip to UCSC</title><summary>Sixty local second-graders visited UCSC on May 22 as part of College Nine and College Ten's Service-Learning program.</summary><keywords>Service-Learning program</keywords><description>Sixty local second-graders visited UCSC on May 22 as part of College Nine and College Ten's Service-Learning program.</description><start-date>1211439600000</start-date><display-name>School kids take a...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2231</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2231</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338646207</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338646207</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/mcginty.felicia.w.kids.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/mcginty.felicia.w.kids.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mcginty.felicia.w.kids.250.jpg</name><file-size>18759</file-size><width>250</width><height>241</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Felicia McGinty, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, addresses the kids. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/violas.lucee.rateiki.azrai.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/violas.lucee.rateiki.azrai.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>violas.lucee.rateiki.azrai.250.jpg</name><file-size>26866</file-size><width>250</width><height>313</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UCSC student Stephanie "Lucee" Violas, left, with field trip participant Azrai Rateiki.</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/tang.lenny.williams.christoper.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/tang.lenny.williams.christoper.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tang.lenny.williams.christoper.250.jpg</name><file-size>16023</file-size><width>250</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UCSC student Lenny Tang, right, with another field trip guest, Christopher Williams.

<p>What the heck makes that racket?</p>
<p>That campus conundrum and many others are demystified in a new edition of <em>The Natural History of the UC Santa Cruz Campus,</em> released this month. The book, lovingly assembled and packed with easily digestible information and more than 125 photos, drawings, diagrams, and maps, is full of "aha!" moments.</p>
<p>So--that clicking sound? On page 187, it's all explained. It's coming from male woodland cicadas, sending out their mating calls with "a cacophony of mechanical-sounding clicks." These little insects climb high into the trees, so that they're often heard but rarely seen.</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p>The second edition of <em>The Natural History of the UC Santa Cruz Campus</em> was edited by Tonya Haff, curator of the UCSC Museum of Natural History Collections; Martha Brown, Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems senior editor; and W. Breck Tyler, research ornithologist for the Institute of Marine Sciences. Bay Tree Bookstore, which acted as publisher of the book, has printed 3,000 copies, and hopes the book is popular enough to warrant another printing soon.</p>
<p>The trio worked on a new edition because the first edition, out of print for nearly 25 years, is hard to find, and there's no other easy source people can turn to for information about the natural history of the area, said Haff.</p>
<p>"This is so much more substantive, even though the first one was wonderful," said Haff, who raised more than $20,000 to cover the costs of the new edition.</p>
<p>"This is a quantum leap in terms of information," agreed Brown.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the memory of the late Ken Norris, professor of natural history and coordinator of the Environmental Field Program, the book covers human history, geology, plants, mushrooms, lichen, and animals.</p>
<p>The animal and fungus chapters are new; the history chapter is almost entirely new; and other chapters were amended from the originals. The editors updated the lists of plants and animals found here, and hired past and present students, including one from the UCSC Extension Science Illustration Certificate Program, to provide almost all new illustrations.</p>
<p>From banana slugs to bobcats, redwood groves to rolling meadows, caves to quarries, readers can learn about the campus's wealth of wildlife, geologic features, and cultural imprints.</p>
<p>The writers encourage active learning. For example, in a sidebar on "The Importance of Tule," they give the exact location, with map, of some tule, a grass-like member of the Sedge family: "Near campus, tule is in the Kalkar Quarry near Faculty Housing." The book also advises tule-searchers to "bring a knife to cut through the strong, outer skin so that you can examine the whitish, lightweight pith inside."</p>
<p>"I encourage people to be hands-on," said Haff. "I definitely encourage that kind of learning. Reading a book is fine, but there's nothing like touching, seeing, and smelling what you're learning about."</p>
<p>Edifying facts jump out of nowhere. For example, you can find out the source of the word "limelight" and--if you dare--learn about the startling sex life of banana slugs.</p>
<p>Freelance writers, staff, faculty members, undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post-doctoral student contributed to the book, and it has back-cover endorsement from Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University and Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford University--"biology gods," according to Brown.</p>
<p>Haff and Brown hope the book inspires curiosity, a love of the campus, and stewardship of campus lands. But also, they said, the volume highlights not only what we know about the campus, but what we don't--for example, why have the burrowing owls disappeared? And why do turret spiders build strange, castle-like structures at the entrance to their burrows?</p>
<p>"There's a wealth of research opportunities for students and faculty," said Brown.</p>
<p>And, she said, the information is relevant not only to campus but to the Santa Cruz Mountains region.</p>
<p>"So anyone interested in the region's natural history will want it on their bookshelf," Brown said.</p>
<p>The second edition of <em>The Natural History of the UC Santa Cruz Campus</em> is available for $12.95 at the Bay Tree Bookstore, and $2 per book sale returns into a fund for the next edition.</p>
<p>It will soon be available at bookstores in town, according to Haff.</p>

Featured on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine in 1932, Jeffers's major works include the <i>Roan Stallion</i>, <i>Tamar and Other Poems</i> (1925), <i>The Women at Point Sur</i> (1927), and a 1946 adaptation of the Greek drama <i>Medea</i>.</p><p>He died in 1962.</p><p>"I am delighted to partner with the Poetry Foundation to celebrate the great American poet Robinson Jeffers and his deep connection to California and to our nation's Pacific coast," said NEA Chairman Gioia. "Jeffers's hard-edged yet musical poetry continues to challenge and inspire all Americans to greater care and stewardship of our natural resources, and it's fitting that we announce these grants here in the landscape that he so loved."</p><p>"The Central Coast has a rich history of literary genius, from the powerful works of John Steinbeck to the moving poetry of Violet de Cristoforo," added Rep. Farr. "The NEA's support for these programs highlighting the life and work of Robinson Jeffers helps build on this tradition. It's important to our communities to keep our history alive, and there is no better tool to instill an appreciation for art in our youth than to let them experience just how moving it can be."</p><p>UCSC will receive $5,000 to host a symposium on the work of Jeffers. The celebration will feature a keynote address on Jeffer's life and work, a staged reading of his adaptation of <i>Medea</i>, and readings by award-winning poets, including Adrienne Rich, Li-Young Lee, and Mark Jarman. </p><p>					</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156f3768072704601a012ff44069a63"><name>2238</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>AFSCME strike on June 4-5</title><summary>In a message to the UCSC community, Campus Provost David Kliger writes about an announced strike by the AFSCME union on June 4-5.</summary><keywords>AFSCME strike</keywords><description>In a message to the UCSC community, Campus Provost David Kliger writes about an announced strike by the AFSCME union on June 4-5.</description><start-date>1211958000000</start-date><display-name>AFSCME strike on June...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2238</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2238</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338648867</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338648867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The union representing Service and Patient Care Technical employees (AFSCME) has announced its intention to conduct a UC systemwide strike on Wednesday and Thursday, June 4-5.

<p>The stellar corpse, called SGR 1900+14, belongs to a class of objects known as magnetars. These are the cores of massive stars that blew up in supernova explosions, but unlike other dead stars, they slowly pulsate with x-rays and have tremendously strong magnetic fields.</p>
<p>"This magnetar is still alive in many ways," said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "It is interacting with its environment, making a big impact on the young star-forming region where it was born."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is coauthor of a paper about the findings in the May 29 issue of <em>Nature</em>. The lead author is Stefanie Wachter of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.</p>
<p>"The universe is a big place and weird things can happen," said Wachter, who found the ring serendipitously. "I was flipping through archived Spitzer data of the object, and that's when I noticed it was surrounded by a ring we'd never seen before."</p>
<p>Wachter and her colleagues think that the ring, which is unlike anything ever seen before, formed in 1998 when the magnetar erupted in a giant flare. They believe the crusty surface of the magnetar cracked, sending out a flare, or blast of energy, that excavated a nearby cloud of dust, leaving an outer, dusty ring. This ring is oblong, with dimensions of about seven by three light-years. It appears to be flat, or two-dimensional, but the scientists said they can't rule out the possibility of a three-dimensional shell.</p>
<p>"It's as if the magnetar became a huge flaming torch and obliterated the dust around it, creating a massive cavity," said Chryssa Kouveliotou, senior astrophysicist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and a coauthor of the paper. "Then the stars nearby lit up a ring of fire around the dead star, marking it for eternity."</p>
<p>The discovery could help scientists figure out if a star's mass influences whether it becomes a magnetar when it dies. Though scientists know that stars above a certain mass will "go supernova," they do not know if mass plays a role in determining whether the star becomes a magnetar or a run-of-the-mill dead star. According to the science team, the ring demonstrates that SGR 1900+14 belongs to a nearby cluster of young, massive stars. By studying the masses of these nearby stars, the scientists might learn the approximate mass of the original star that exploded and became SGR 1900+14.</p>
<p>"The ring has to be lit up by something, otherwise Spitzer wouldn't have seen it," said Ramirez-Ruiz. "The nearby massive stars are most likely what's heating the dust and lighting it up, and this means that the magnetar, which lies at the exact center of the ring, is associated with the massive star-forming region."</p>
<p>Rings and spheres are common in the universe. Young, hot stars blow bubbles in space, carving out dust into spherical shapes. When stars die in supernova explosions, their remains are blasted into space, forming short-lived beautiful orbs called supernova remnants. Rings can also form around exploded stars whose expanding shells of debris ram into pre-existing dust rings, causing the dust to glow, as is the case with the supernova remnant called 1987A.</p>
<p>But the ring around the magnetar SGR 1900+14 fits into none of these categories. For one thing, supernova remnants and the ring around 1987A cry out with X-rays and radio waves. The ring around SGR 1900+14 only glows at specific infrared wavelengths that Spitzer can see.</p>
<p>At first, the astronomers thought the ring must be what's called an infrared echo. These occur when an object sends out a blast wave that travels outward, heating up dust and causing it to glow with infrared light. But when they went back to observe SGR 1900+14 later, the ring didn't move outward as it should have if it were an infrared echo.</p>
<p>A closer analysis of the pictures later revealed that the ring is most likely a carved-out cavity in a dust cloud, a phenomenon that must be somewhat rare in the universe since it had not been seen before. The scientists plan to look for more of these rings.</p>

</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Led by senior Kevin Louie, students held a Relay Rally and raised approximately $1,000 in support of the American Cancer Society's annual Relay for Life. The rally, held May 3 at the Family Student Housing field, was sponsored by SOAR and hosted by Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>Approximately 120 students and community members participated in games, heard cancer survivors speak, enjoyed live music and a barbecue, and participated in a raffle for prizes. Participants also walked a "track" defined by several hundred candle-lit luminarias in commemoration of those who have succumbed to cancer and those who have survived.</p>
<p>Kevin Louie's leadership and commitment earned him a "Rookie of the Year Award" from the American Cancer Society. His commitment to fundraising for cancer education, treatment, and research grew out of his own experience--his mother died of cancer when he was 15. In his hometown of Bakersfield, he has participated in Relay for Life events for a number of years.</p>
<p>"Relay for Life is extremely important to me because it gives me a chance to remember my mother's loss to cancer but to also celebrate the courageous and positive fight she gave," Louie said. "Relay is also a way for me to reach out to those battling the disease right now and to try and make a difference in their lives."</p>
<p>Funding for the Relay Rally was donated by students, parents, and community members. Prizes were donated by local merchants.</p>
<p>The American Cancer Society Relay for Life of Santa Cruz will take place July 18-19 at Cabrillo College and involve over 1,000 community members. The event is expected to raise over $130,000 for cancer research, education, and support services. UCSC staff, faculty, alumni, and students are organizing teams for the 24-hour event.

Although the vaccine did not succeed in preventing infections, the clinical trial generated a huge amount of valuable data for researchers studying how the virus evolves and causes new infections. </p><p>Modeled on the UCSC Genome Browser, the GSID HIV Data Browser is the brainchild of Phillip Berman, professor and chair of biomolecular engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. Berman helped oversee the clinical trials, which ended in 2003, when he was senior vice president for research and development at VaxGen, the company that developed the vaccine and conducted Phase III clinical trials in North America, Europe, and Thailand.</p><p>"After the trials concluded, I spent a couple of years trying to think what was the most important thing I could do for HIV research," Berman said. "I concluded it was using new technology to preserve the data from these clinical trials and present it in a form useful to the scientific community."</p><p>In 2004, Berman cofounded GSID, based in South San Francisco and dedicated to combining knowledge and expertise from the biotechnology industry and the public health sector to address infectious disease problems in the developing world. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2006.</p><p>"Despite the fact that the vaccine trial didn't work, a huge amount of useful information was obtained," Berman said. The "North American" trial included about 60 different clinical sites in North America and one site in the Netherlands. Of particular value to researchers are the genetic sequences of the viruses that infected participants during the trial. </p><p>"The trial represented the only up-to-date broad survey of virus sequences from new infections that had ever been carried out," Berman said. "Every time there was a new infection in the vaccine or placebo group, the virus was sequenced. The sequence information provides the best picture we have about what the immune system sees when there is a new infection." </p><p>This is important, Berman said, because other major repositories of HIV sequence data are not annotated for the time after infection, the clinical status of the patient, or the histories of the specimens sequenced. That limits their usefulness for studying such a rapidly evolving virus. </p><p>HIV is highly mutable and evolves in response to attacks by the immune system. As a result, HIV isolated from a patient years after the initial infection is genetically different from the virus that caused the infection in the first place. A vaccine should target the most infectious form of the virus, Berman said. Yet all the vaccines tested so far have been based on viruses isolated from patients with longstanding infections.</p><p>"A current hypothesis in HIV vaccine research is that the antigenic structures of HIV viruses that mediate new infections differ from those recovered from people long after infection," Berman explained. "The specimens in this set represent the largest group from new infections that has ever been collected." </p><p>Besides viral genome-sequence data, the database links to a repository of preserved specimens (blood samples and cells) that researchers can access from GSID and the National Insitutes of Health (NIH) for further study. </p><p>"This is the first time that an HIV sequence database has been linked to a specimen repository and a database of clinical information," Berman said. "These clinical specimens are longitudinal, collected from the same person during a two-year follow-up period. This will allow investigators to study the evolution of the virus and the evolution of the immune response and clinical outcomes."</p><p>At UCSC, Berman teamed up with the Genome Browser group to develop a browser for the sensitive clinical data collected during the vaccine trial. Jim Kent, associate research scientist for the UCSC Genome Browser and principal investigator on the project, said it was the first time his group had worked with data from participants in a clinical trial. </p><p>"This data must be handled differently and great care taken with confidentiality," Kent said. "We learned from this project how to build the infrastructure to cope with that. This will be useful for other medical projects, such as cancer genomics, in the future." </p><p>Fan Hsu, director of proteomics for the UCSC Genome Browser, said the emphasis on security was very different from past projects. "Before, everything we have worked on is totally open, totally public. With the GSID project, only authorized users can access the data, so we needed to set up special controls," Hsu said. </p><p>How to display the very large number of HIV sequences on the browser was another challenge. "Our original genome browser has only one reference genome. For this HIV database, we have about 350 infected people and more than 1,000 sequences," he said.</p><p>Hsu and software developer Galt Barber adapted the genome browser software to accommodate the large number of HIV sequences and the data security along with interactive selection criteria for viewing the data. As the project evolved, Hsu also coordinated the transfer of the software to GSID. The UCSC team, which also included Erich Weiler, Robert Kuhn, and Ann Zweig, worked nights and weekends to bring the new browser online. </p><p>The resulting GSID HIV Data Browser is a customized version of the UCSC Genome Browser. It provides researchers with searchable demographic and clinical data from volunteers who became HIV infected during the VaxGen clinical trial. The browser allows users to align viral sequences with one another and with reference or consensus sequences.</p><p>"This is something where the university can make a difference, because the private sector is not so interested in vaccines; they're not so profitable," Kent said. "There is very little economic incentive to develop an AIDS vaccine, but there is a tremendous humanitarian incentive."</p><p>Kent hopes that just as the UCSC Genome Browser has continued to build the collaborative nature of the genomics research community, this HIV data browser will help motivate the AIDS research community to work together and pool their data. </p><p>Vaccine development efforts have been repeatedly frustrated. An HIV vaccine candidate developed by the pharmaceutical company Merck recently failed in clinical trials cosponsored by NIH. "The recent failure of the Merck HIV vaccine has thrown the field into turmoil," Berman said. "All the best ideas for an HIV vaccine in the past 20 years have failed. The information in this database is now more critical than anyone could have imagined. It tells us what's being transmitted."</p><p>The next phase of the HIV browser project involves releasing the sequence data from infected participants in the Phase III clinical trial that VaxGen conducted in Thailand. </p><p>"In the future, the database will be expanded to allow associations between virus sequences, clinical data, immune response data, and host genetics," Berman said. "We hope to eventually include data from other HIV vaccine trials sponsored by the NIH, private companies, and other HIV vaccine research organizations." </p><p>GSID is making these data and serological samples available to the HIV research community through an agreement with VaxGen and with funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>For information on accessing the GSID HIV Data Browser and background on the clinical trials, visit the <a href="http://www.gsid.org/index02.html">GSID web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156fd0e8072704601a012ff69ac678e"><name>2244</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation BBQ draws a crowd</title><summary>More than 1,600 staff members loaded up plates with burgers, hot dogs, salads, and watermelon on Wednesday for the annual UCSC Staff Appreciation Barbecue on the East Field. </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Staff Appreciation BBQ</keywords><description>More than 1,600 staff members loaded up plates with burgers, hot dogs, salads, and watermelon on Wednesday for the annual UCSC Staff Appreciation Barbecue on the East Field. </description><start-date>1212044400000</start-date><display-name>Staff Appreciation BBQ draws...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2244</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2244</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338651349</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338651349</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/bbq.overview.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/bbq.overview.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bbq.overview.300.jpg</name><file-size>13000</file-size><width>300</width><height>178</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sunny skies eventually emerged at Wednesday's Staff Appreciation Barbecue. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/splitshift.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/splitshift.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>splitshift.300.jpg</name><file-size>18324</file-size><width>300</width><height>196</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Split Shift rocks the East Field. </image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/05/images/tables.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/05/images/tables.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tables.300.jpg</name><file-size>21065</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Staff members check out the informational tables.

<p>Cool breezes and gray skies were the order of the day at first, but the sun made it out later in the afternoon while Split Shift, a band made up entirely of UCSC staffers, belted out blues and classics such as "The Letter" and "Got My Mojo Working."</p>
<p>Earlier, another staff band, The Cultivators, played bluegrass and folk tunes including the hymn "I'll Fly Away."</p>
<p>Attendees plunked down on the grass or sat at long tables set up on the field.</p>
<p>The barbecue, sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board with support from the Chancellor's Office and administrative divisions, was produced this year in lieu of a Staff Appreciation Breakfast, held in recent years.</p>
<p>The event included informational booths representing groups including the Women at Work Retreat and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. Staff could also enter a free raffle giving away prizes such as dinner with Chancellor Blumenthal, Macy's gift certificates, and Zipcar credits.</p>

Lowe's graduate student David Bernick won a GREAT grant for his research on gene regulation in a special class of microbes called the Archaea, which have very unusual biological characteristics and may have great potential for biotechnology applications. </p><p>"It's really enabled this project," Lowe said. "The grant not only fully funds his work for two years, it allows us to work on a high-risk project. There is very little grant money available for this kind of high-risk, high-payoff project."</p><p>Electrical engineering student Oscar Azucena won a GREAT grant for his project developing novel adaptive-optics microscopy for deep-tissue imaging. Azucena is working with Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering and an affiliate of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC. Image degradation is a serious problem as light travels through thick biological specimens, so the researchers are using adaptive-optics techniques developed for astronomy and applying them to microscopy. This approach could have widespread application in many fields of biology and biomedicine.</p><p>"This grant is key to keeping the project moving forward," Kubby said.</p><p>Biology graduate student Jesse Raab won a GREAT grant for his work with Rohinton Kamakaka, associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology. Raab is developing bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize important factors in gene regulation known as insulator elements. They play a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes in everything from yeast to mammals.</p><p>"This gives us seed money to start a new project and expand our research into new areas," Kamakaka said. "We've been studying insulator elements in my lab for ten years, mostly in yeast, and now we will start studying them in human cells."</p><p>Martina Newell McGloughlin, director of the UC Davis-based UC Systemwide Biotechnology Research and Education Program, said the GREAT training grant program aims to nurture rapid advancements in technology in diverse fields such as nanotechnology and biomedical engineering. </p><p>"Each year, this spirited competition draws the brightest young minds from all of the UC campuses, with 11 graduate-student researchers selected on the basis of their demonstrated ability to understand and solve problems that cross over very different disciplines," McGloughlin said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157024b8072704601a012ffc7260b3e"><name>2248</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus community asked to participate in carpool survey</title><start-date>1212130800000</start-date><display-name>Campus community asked to...</display-name><path>/2008/05/2248</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/05/2248</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338652680</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338652680</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A group of students and researchers associated with Psychology 217, "Technology Benefiting Humanity," have conceptualized a new carpool-on-demand service that could provide on-the-spot ride-matching using mobile phone technology.
