Zuo will use the funds for a research project that employs cellular imaging techniques to explore changes in the brain after a stroke and during rehabilitation.</p><p>A stroke disrupts the blood supply to part of the brain. In just one minute, the disruption can destroy about 14 billion brain synapses--the specialized junctions through which nerve cells communicate with each other and with other cell types. After a stroke, the brain undergoes reorganization, but little is known about the nature and timing of the synapse remodeling that occurs during this brief period of recovery. </p><p>Zuo's lab uses mouse models to study the structural changes and functional declines that occur in the nervous system as a result of normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. The Dana Foundation grant will fund research using fluorescent two-photon microscopy to repeatedly (over days and months) view the nerve cells and synapses in mice after strokes have been induced in the sensorimotor cortex. </p><p>Zuo and her research team will also image the reformation of synapses as the mice receive limb training and an enzyme called chondroitinase ABC. In this way, Zuo will test her hypothesis that persistent training of affected limbs can stabilize newly formed synapses, while the enzyme reduces scarring and optimizes motor recovery.</p><p>"The research should help to guide new approaches for maximizing stroke rehabilitation outcomes in patients," she said.</p><p>In addition to the Dana Foundation, Zuo's work has attracted support in the past year from several other foundations. These include the Ellison Medical Foundation, the American Federation for Aging Research, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (see earlier stories <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1473">here</a> and <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1067">here</a>).</p><p>The Dana Foundation is a private philanthropy that offers science and health grants to support brain research in neuroscience and immunology and their interrelationship in human health and disease.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915496328072704601a012ff0ccc718a"><name>1844</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1199689200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1844</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1844</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338493954</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338493954</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

"Paul was always asking us, 'What do you want to do? Who do you want to work with?' It's networking, basically."</p><p>The result was Roper's especially rich undergraduate experience, highlighted by her internships in Kenya, a year spent living in a "sustainable community" on campus, and an academic program that integrated environmental studies and economics. Along the way, Roper produced two video documentaries about Kenyan forestry practices that showcase her grasp of the tensions between "haves" and "have nots"--and helped her land a job right out of college with award-winning documentary filmmaker Alicia Dwyer.</p><p>"Katie is someone who tapped the best of UCSC," said sociology professor Paul Lubeck. "She took advantage of everything the campus has to offer."</p><p>Roper met Lubeck during her first quarter on campus, when he was teaching World Society, a survey course that covered feudalism, mercantilism, capitalism, and globalism. That's when she learned about the Global Information Internship Program (GIIP), a three-quarter, student-directed class Lubeck has developed to combine practical training in information technology with sociological theories about globalization, networking, and social change. Students gain technical skills that prepare them for internships around the world with nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations that need assistance harnessing the power of the Internet. "It's about sharing the democratizing power of new technology," says Lubeck.</p><p>Roper enrolled in the class and quickly acquired videography skills that made her the envy of friends majoring in film. "They couldn't believe what we were doing, because they hadn't even touched a camera yet," recalls Roper, who like many students, had no particular affinity for computers or technology before enrolling in GIIP (pronounced "jeep"). </p><p>"GIIP is all about how to use technology in empowering ways, and it's empowering for the students in the class," adds Roper, who attended high school in San Luis Obispo and chose UCSC in part because she was eager for opportunities to interact closely with professors. "Students are encouraged to bring their own resources to the class." </p><p>At Lubeck's urging, she met with an economist working in Kenya during a visit to UCSC. As a result, she spent the summer of 2005 as an intern with Sustainable Aid in Africa (SANA), a small nongovernmental organization focused on water provision. She returned to Kenya the following year as an intern with the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), where she single-handedly produced a six-minute video documentary called <i>Thirsty Trees: And the Search for Better Alternatives</i> (http://giip.ucsc.edu/content/view/104/37/).</p><p>In a country where cycles of drought and monsoon dictate treks of up to six hours to fetch water during the dry season, SANA's work developing wells and roof catchment systems is critical. Roper developed a web site for the organization, prepared brochures, Powerpoint presentations, and other outreach materials, and provided technical training to SANA staffers so they could continue her work after her departure. The video she produced for ICRAF calls attention to the emerging problem of nonnative eucalyptus trees. The fast-growing evergreens have been introduced to address Kenya's fuel shortage, but mature trees consume an average of 200 liters of precious water a day. The film was screened during World Water Week in Stockholm and has been shown to members of Kenya's Parliament.</p><p>Roper's success required overcoming numerous cultural and logistical challenges: She negotiated budgets, worked with forestry scientists, overcame language problems, and chose to extend her stay in Kenya to produce a second documentary about a promising alternative source of firewood, charcoal, and building materials: indigenous bamboo. That film was screened--and well-received--during a United Nations-sponsored side event to the Nairobi meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. </p><p>The internships gave Roper the opportunity to apply many of the skills she'd learned as a GIIP fellow. "I gained confidence and understood how to ask for things," she recalls. "I became assertive about what I wanted to do. GIIP provides very practical training. The emphasis is on problem solving and troubleshooting. It's a confidence-booster."</p><p>After her first trip to Kenya, Roper returned to UCSC and joined the Program in Community and Agroecology (PICA), an experiential living and learning program that focuses on the environment and sustainable food production. Students live in dedicated housing in The Village, adjacent to the UCSC Farm on lower campus, where they have created an "eco" community, growing, harvesting, and cooking as much of their own food as possible. "After Kenya, I really wanted to live sustainably and tread lightly," says Roper. "PICA is like a little intentional community. We strived to work together, to solve problems together, to really understand each other and get along--life skills, basically."  </p><p>The brainchild of environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman, PICA satisfied Roper's desire to interact closely with like-minded students who share her commitment to the environment and social justice. Academically, she chose a double major in environmental studies and economics--an increasingly popular combination--to broaden her toolset, inspired in part by environmental studies professor Alan Richards, whose background is in economics. "Environmental studies is where my heart is, but I see economics as a way of communicating," she explains. "Economics is challenging, because it's not the way I think about things, but it's like my second pair of glasses. I see economics as the mediation point."</p><p>Roper worked her way through school, most recently as a policy assistant for the Organic Farming Research Foundation, and says she is ready now for the next phase of her life. "I feel really prepared to go out in the world," says Roper, who will start her job as a production assistant for filmmaker Alicia Dwyer in February.

During his travail, which he faced with a noble calm and Stoic resolve, Dr. Lease was nurtured and supported by his cherished wife of 19 years, Dorothea E. Ditchfield, formerly of Toronto, Canada. </p><p>Dr. Lease's scholarly competence spanned a remarkably wide spectrum of disciplines: History of Early Christianity, History of Germany, History of the Papacy and Ecclesiastical History, Near Eastern and Egyptian Archeology, theology, and History of National Socialism, to all of which he contributed important and original publications. </p><p>Dr. Lease came to UCSC in 1973 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. During his thirty-five years of service at UCSC, Dr. Lease gained a reputation as an administrator as well as a highly esteemed, though sometimes controversial teacher, scholar, and critic. He served as the chairperson of a number of different departments, namely Religious Studies, Environmental Studies as well as the Language program, as Dean of Humanities, as Provost of Kresge College, as Associate Chancellor and as Director of University of California's Education Abroad Program in Göttingen, West Germany.  </p><p>Gary also served as executive secretary of the North American Association for the Study of Religion and was the current treasurer of the International Association for the History of Religion. He performed these administrative tasks while maintaining a continuous record of fulltime teaching and original research in archaeology, history, religious studies, and modern German history. He was as happy working in archaeological digs in Egypt and Syria as he was plowing through ancient documents in the archives and libraries of Rome, Berlin, or Israel. Before his death, Dr. Lease was working on what was to be a massive study of the debate over the origin of religion.</p><p>He was a brilliant writer, as anyone who was privileged to receive his poignant emails detailing the condition of his deteriorating health, will tell you.</p><p>Dr. Lease was also a world-class hunter and marksman. He hunted big game all over the world and trekked the hills and plains of Europe and America, as well as Namibia and South Africa in pursuit of the huntsman's most prized quarry. He was a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, Member/Chair of the Santa Cruz Fish and Game Commission and served as well on the Board of the Watsonville Chapter of the California Waterfowl Association, and a number of other naturalist associations devoted to the rational and ecologically beneficial cultivation of the fauna and flora of the world. </p><p>Dr. Lease was also a superb chef, as those who have been privileged to participate in one of his grand game meals will enthusiastically attest. Finally, as a son of Rex Lease, a silent movie star and, later, a hero of many Westerns, Dr. Lease was the custodian of a rich record of information and lore about the early days of Hollywood cinema. </p><p>Dr. Lease is survived by his wife, Dorothea Ditchfield, his son, Dylan Scott Lease and his partner Natasha Kerr and grandson Bailey, his faithful hounds Sirius Sam and Barney Blue.</p><p>A memorial event for Professor Lease is planned, the date, time, and location will be posted at the History of Consciousness web page: http://humwww.ucsc.edu/HistCon/. Those who wish to honor Professor Lease may do so by contributing to the Gary Lease Fellowship Fund, a scholarship to support graduate scholarship in History of Consciousness.</p><p>Ach, wie ist's möglich dann,</p><p>Dass ich dich lassen kann?</p><p>_________________</p><p>Note: <i>A campus memorial event for Gary Lease will take place on Saturday, February 2, at 2 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall</i>. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154a05f8072704601a012ffcbbc751c"><name>1851</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Capital Fellows Program seeking applicants</title><summary>The Center for California Studies of California State University, Sacramento, is taking applications for the Capital Fellows Program.</summary><keywords>Capital Fellowship Program</keywords><description>The Center for California Studies of California State University, Sacramento, is taking applications for the Capital Fellows Program.</description><start-date>1199689200000</start-date><display-name>Capital Fellows Program seeking...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1851</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1851</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338496562</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338496562</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Center for California Studies of California State University, Sacramento, is taking applications for the Capital Fellows Program.

Stephens.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the race to make solar cells cheaper and more efficient, many researchers and start-up companies are betting on new designs that exploit nanostructures--materials engineered on the scale of a billionth of a meter. Using nanotechnology, researchers can experiment with and control how a material generates, captures, transports, and stores free electrons--properties that are important for the conversion of sunlight into electricity.</p>
<p>Two nanotech methods for engineering solar cell materials have shown particular promise. One uses thin films of metal oxide nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide, doped with other elements, such as nitrogen. Another strategy employs quantum dots--nanosize crystals--that strongly absorb visible light. These tiny semiconductors inject electrons into a metal oxide film, or "sensitize" it, to increase solar energy conversion. Both doping and quantum dot sensitization extend the visible light absorption of the metal oxide materials.</p>
<p>Combining these two approaches appears to yield better solar cell materials than either one alone does, according to Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Zhang led a team of researchers from California, Mexico, and China that created a thin film doped with nitrogen and sensitized with quantum dots. When tested, the new nanocomposite material performed better than predicted--as if the functioning of the whole material was greater than the sum of its two individual components.</p>
<p>"We have discovered a new strategy that could be very useful for enhancing the photo response and conversion efficiency of solar cells based on nanomaterials," said Zhang. "We initially thought that the best we might do is get results as good as the sum of the two, and maybe if we didn't make this right, we'd get something worse. But surprisingly, these materials were much better."</p>
<p>The group's findings were reported in the <em>Journal of Physical Chemistry</em> in a paper posted online on January 4. Lead author of the paper was Tzarara Lopez-Luke, a graduate student visiting in Zheng's lab who is now at the Instituto de Investigaciones Metalurgicas, UMSNH, Morelia, Mexico.</p>
<p>Zhang's team characterized the new nanocomposite material using a broad range of tools, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry techniques. They prepared films with thicknesses between 150 and 1100 nanometers, with titanium dioxide particles that had an average size of 100 nanometers. They doped the titanium dioxide lattice with nitrogen atoms. To this thin film, they chemically linked quantum dots made of cadmium selenide for sensitization.</p>
<p>The resulting hybrid material offered a combination of advantages. Nitrogen doping allowed the material to absorb a broad range of light energy, including energy from the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The quantum dots also enhanced visible light absorption and boosted the photocurrent and power conversion of the material.</p>
<p>When compared with materials that were just doped with nitrogen or just embedded with cadmium selenide quantum dots, the nanocomposite showed higher performance, as measured by the "incident photon to current conversion efficiency" (IPCE), the team reported. The nanocomposite's IPCE was as much as three times greater than the sum of the IPCEs for the two other materials, Zhang said.</p>
<p>"We think what's happening is that it's easier for the charge to hop around in the material," he explained. "That can only happen if you have both the quantum dot sensitizing and the nitrogen doping at the same time."</p>
<p>The nanocomposite material could be used not only to enhance solar cells, but also to serve as part of other energy technologies. One of Zhang's long-term goals is to marry a highly efficient solar cell with a state-of-the-art photoelectrochemical cell. Such a device could, in theory, use energy generated from sunlight to split water and produce hydrogen fuel (see earlier <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=712">press release</a>). The nanocomposite material could also potentially be useful in devices for converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane.</p>
<p>The new strategy for engineering solar cell materials offers a promising path for Zhang's lab to explore for years to come.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited because this work is preliminary and there's a lot of optimizing we can do now," Zhang noted. "We have three materials--or three parameters--that we can play with to make the energy levels just right."</p>
<p>In essence, the team has been trying to manipulate materials so that when sunlight strikes them, the free electrons generated can easily move from one energy level to another--or jump across the different materials--and be efficiently converted to electricity.</p>
<p>"What we're doing is essentially 'band-gap engineering.' We're manipulating the energy levels of the nanocomposite material so the electrons can work more efficiently for electricity generation," Zhang said. "If our model is correct, we're making a good case for this kind of strategy."</p>
<p>Sources of funding for this research included the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation of China, and the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC-MEXUS).</p>
<p>Research collaborators included Abraham Wolcott, Li-ping Xu and Shaowei Chen at UCSC; Zhenhai Wen and Jinghong Li at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China; and Elder De La Rosa of the Centro de Investigaciones en Optica, A.C., in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico.</p>

This has been especially difficult for the faculty, staff, and students who teach, work, and study in that area.</p><p>Since the end of fall quarter, the campus has taken several steps to respond to this situation:</p><p>. On December 17, campus grounds crews spent several hours on the site, cleaning up trash and debris left by people who had been illegally camping on the ground there since November 7.  The clean up also restored parking--including disabled spaces--that had been impacted by the encampment.</p><p>. We are seeking a court order that would expressly prohibit named defendants and all other individuals from engaging in the types of activities that have occurred at the site.  A hearing is scheduled for January 9 in Santa Cruz County Superior Court.</p><p>. Several citations have been issued at the site in connection with activities there.</p><p>. In addition, Student Affairs staff have continued to visit the site on a regular basis to check on the health and welfare of any students there, and UCSC police have continued to issue daily warnings about violations of law and campus regulations.</p><p>We want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the many faculty, staff, and students who have engaged in positive and constructive dialogue over the past few weeks regarding this situation.

He just wishes he could get his hands on enough tickets for all his friends and family.</p><p>Nakamura, a graduate student in the Social Documentation Program at UCSC, has created a 22-minute documentary that has been accepted in the "short film" category of the prestigious film festival. The film, <i>Pilgrimage</i>, tells the story of how Japanese Americans have reclaimed the World War II concentration camp at Manzanar, transforming it into a symbol of solidarity and empowerment. <i>Pilgrimage</i> will screen four times during the festival, which runs January 17-27 in Park City, Utah. </p><p>"I really didn't think I had a chance at all of getting in," said Nakamura, a Los Angeles native who was drawn to UCSC's program because of its focus on using film, radio, and photography to make social change. His goal is to produce films that will engage and educate young people, and he is looking toward a career in education. </p><p>Nakamura remembers falling asleep during high school history classes and says he only passed his AP history class by watching documentaries on the History Channel. "There's a specific group that film reaches--people like me," he said. </p><p>"I didn't like school. As a kid growing up, I felt the history I was learning in class wasn't relevant to myself, or my family--and even when it was relevant, it was boring and outdated," said Nakamura. "My goal is to reach the kids who don't see anyone who looks like themselves in their books."</p><p>Nakamura, 27, infuses the soundtracks of his films with hip-hop music, and his thesis project is a film biography of Japanese-American folk musician Chris Iijima. "He and his singing partner were like the Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell of the Asian American movement of the 1960s," he said. "I wanted to make a film about the music and culture of that movement." </p><p>Although his parents are documentary filmmakers, Nakamura didn't explore the medium until he was in college, when he discovered film as a tool for community organizing and social activism. As an Asian American studies student at UCLA, Nakamura made his first film, <i>Yellow Brotherhood</i>, about a youth basketball team in Los Angeles. The team was made up of the children of the founders of a Japanese American anti-gang self-help organization called Yellow Brotherhood. After earning a B.A. in 2003, Nakamura began work on the project that became <i>Pilgrimage,</i> another story that touched his family.</p><p>Nakamura's father, as well as his maternal and paternal grandparents, were incarcerated at Manzanar, the desolate internment camp about 250 miles northeast of Los Angeles. His two uncles were born there. After the war, his relatives, like most Japanese American survivors of the camps, never talked about their experiences. "The government hid history from the country, and many Japanese Americans hid it from their families," explained Nakamura. "My dad said it was like a prison record--something you don't talk about."  </p><p>But Robert Nakamura participated in the first pilgrimage to Manzanar in 1969, which was organized by Japanese American activists inspired by Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington and Cesar Chavez's March from Delano to Sacramento. <i>Pilgrimage</i> tells the story of how Manzanar was transformed from a place of shame into a place of empowerment, and the film draws parallels between the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the harassment of Arab Americans in the post-9/11 era. </p><p>"My father's generation inspired the older generation to talk about what happened. My role, my generation's role, is to make it relevant to what's going on in the world now," said Nakamura. "I think the older generation appreciates me trying to tell their story to the next generation that's coming up." </p><p>As an emerging filmmaker, Nakamura was drawn to UCSC's two-year Master's Program in Social Documentation for its commitment to work that has an impact outside academia. "I was attracted to the program's commitment to social change," said Nakamura, who will graduate this spring. "It's a unique program. Most film schools focus on narrative, feature-length fiction films. No other school is offering a similar program."</p><p>And Nakamura was eager for the opportunity to work with award-winning documentary filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena, an associate professor of community studies. "As an Asian American studies student and a Japanese American, she's one of my heroes," he said. "The faculty I've been able to work with have been amazing. Working with (professor) B. Ruby Rich is huge. It's a big privilege. And (lecturer and filmmaker) Spencer Nakasako is another of my mentors."</p><p>With <i>Pilgrimage</i> well underway when he arrived at UCSC, Nakamura spent much of his first year finishing the film and producing a DVD for distribution to high schools and colleges. "I spent a lot of the spring touring, showing the film on college campuses and at community events," said Nakamura. "As with every independent artist, you have to do everything yourself. There's no distribution company, no corporate money. We have to learn to do things ourselves."</p><p>He is committed to making documentary films with the same aesthetic appeal and production values as mainstream movies, eager to bridge the gap between entertainment and "political" films, and Nakamura is gratified that the audience for such work appears to be growing.</p><p>"It's pure luck that I'm an emerging filmmaker at this time. Getting into Sundance gives someone like me encouragement and confidence," he said. "I'm taking it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154aaa78072704601a012ffd39a20c0"><name>1858</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Elections - Mandatory Orientation for Student Fee Referendum</title><start-date>1199862000000</start-date><display-name>Campus Elections - Mandatory...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1858</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1858</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338499192</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338499192</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Please mark your calendars for the upcoming orientations for those interested in authoring a student fee referendum or opinion poll on the 2008 Campus Elections ballot.

Is its infliction determined by the insulter or the insulted? What does it reveal about the character of both parties, as well as the character of society and its conventions? What is its role in social and legal life? How ready should we be to forgive?</p><p>Those questions and more are posed by UC Santa Cruz professor of humanities Jerome Neu in his new book, <i>Sticks and Stones: The Philosophy of Insults</i> (Oxford University Press, 2008), as he explores the nature, purpose and ultimate effect of insults. </p><p>Employing a wide range of examples-from Aristotle and Shakespeare, to Don Rickles and Eminem, to international politics and modern rap music-Neu examines how notions of insult shape our beliefs about character, honor, free speech, social interaction, and law. Drawing from a multitude of disciplines including philosophy, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, and legal studies, Neu illustrates how the assertions and assumptions of dominance implicit in insults constitute a serious and critical form of power play.</p><p>As Neu notes in the book's foreword: "To find guidance on how to live in the world with the many others who impinge on our boundaries, to think about how much we should put up with those who would put us down, it is necessary to explore the nature and place of insult in our lives." </p><p><i>Sticks and Stones</i> includes chapters on the language of abuse, insult humor, emotions generated by insults, and legal issues such as obscenity, hate speech, libel, slander, and blasphemy. He notes that the perennial schoolyard addage: "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me" may sound true, but it's actually false. In the real world, words do have significant effects, and Neu contends that the popular as well as the standard legal distinctions between speech and conduct are themselves troubled. He points out that there are large theoretical issues related to freedom and limits of speech.</p><p>"The regulation of hate speech on a university campus, for example, is a genuinely difficult business, because hate speech can be truly harmful and disrupting to an academic environment," says Neu. "On the other hand, who are you going to shut up and what words are you going to outlaw?  Most existing hate speech regulations focus on obscene and racial slurs, but polite speech can be equally-if not more-hurtful."</p><p>"The truth is, when discussing controversial issues, people's fundamental views may come under assault," Neu adds. "But it's the function of the university to have students' fundamental views subjected to critical scrutiny, so a certain level of discomfort may be essential to the process. And it is dangerous to forbid certain speech because of the experience of history--there are no limits in the end to who gets shut up."</p><p>Neu found no shortage of material to draw on for the book, touching on topics such as the recent uproar over the publication of Danish cartoons depicting images of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, the European institution of dueling and honor, the origin of rap music in underground insult contests in the black community, and the sexual component of certain types of insult. </p><p>"The last chapter is about forgiveness and how much toleration we should give and expect from others" says Neu. "Hopefully a better understanding of the nature and sources of insults will put us in a better position to think fruitfully of our own interactions with others." </p><p>Neu joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1972, where he teaches courses on Freud for the Psychology Department, philosophy of law for the Legal Studies program, as well as various classes for the Philosophy Department. His previous books include <i>Emotion, Thought, and Therapy</i> and <i>A Tear is an Intellectual Thing: The Meanings of Emotion</i>. He is also the editor of the <i>Cambridge Companion to Freud</i>. </p><p>					</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154af4e8072704601a012ffd6cbcfdd"><name>1862</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New national historic area helps reveal clues about a bygone era</title><summary>Long understood locally to be an important historical resource, the former lime operations area near the base of campus at UCSC is now recognized nationally.

<p>But to UCSC senior environmental planner and archaeologist Sally Morgan, such artifacts unlock a treasure chest of information. They can help fill in some of the blanks in the historical record of life on the 30-acre area just inside the main entrance to the campus that once supported the largest lime manufacturing plant in the state.</p>
<p>"Right off the bat, a perfume bottle and a teacup tell you there were women and children living on the site, which is not something you might have known otherwise," said Morgan. The bottle and sugar bowl likely date to 1900 or a little later, according to Morgan. They were found last fall during digging associated with Ranch View Terrace.</p>
<p>Long understood locally to be an important historical resource, the former lime operations area is now recognized nationally. Dubbed the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, in December the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the nation's official list of significant cultural resources worthy of preservation. The historic district includes the Granary, now a childcare center; the Cookhouse, now the Admissions office; several barns; the Cooperage, where barrels for lime shipping were made; the ruins of former workers' cabins; the Blacksmith Shop; the Carriage House; Cardiff House, now the Women's Center but formerly the residence of lime works owner Henry Cowell; and the lime kilns themselves.</p>
<p>"This complex is probably among the most complete in California," said Morgan. "We have a wide range of historical resources that represent the full range of activities that took place on the site historically, including many standing buildings and structures."</p>
<p>To help people learn about the history of the area and what life was like there in the 19th century, Morgan and others have put together a brochure outlining a walking tour of the district, with a map, information on buildings and remains, and historical photographs. The brochure is adapted from the book <a href="http://www.limekilnlegacies.com"><em>Lime Kiln Legacies</em></a> by UCSC alumnus Frank Perry, Robert W. Piwarzyk, Michael D. Luther, Alverda Orlando, Allan Molho, and Sierra L. Perry.</p>
<p>Before <em>Lime Kiln Legacies,</em> there was no other published, detailed history about the lime kilns at UCSC, according to Perry, who earned a degree in Earth sciences in 1977. The 250-page book is available at the UCSC library.</p>
<p>Lime manufacturing played a vital role in shaping Santa Cruz history, said Perry.</p>
<p>"The university wouldn't be here if it weren't for the lime industry," Perry said.</p>
<p>The walking tour brochure will be available in the next couple of weeks at the parking kiosk at the base of campus, as well as in campus libraries and possibly at various downtown Santa Cruz locations.</p>
<p>Also, Morgan and the brochure-production team will put historic photos and artifacts from the site on display in the Science &amp; Engineering Library in the next few weeks. The artifacts will be exhibited there for the rest of the quarter. Additionally, they are working to establish a UCSC-sponsored community involvement group, the Friends of the Cowell Lime Works District, to educate the public and the student body more about the historic district, do more outreach to the public, and to seek grants and other funding for restoration of the historic buildings.</p>
<p>"Restoration is particularly important because some buildings are in bad shape and are at risk of being lost," said Morgan. "Particularly the Cooperage and the workers' cabins. There were originally at least 10 workers' cabins in the district-now only two remain standing."</p>
<p>The team is working on putting up interpretive signs in front of each historical building. In the interim, they'll work on setting up numbered posts that correspond with the numbers in the brochure.</p>
<p>The firm of Davis and Jordan established a lime works at the site in the early 1850s. Lime was a key component of mortar, plaster, and whitewash, and it was used extensively in the building industries of the time. Later, Henry Cowell acquired the lime works and established more support facilities, including a self-sustaining ranch operation, at the site. The Cowell Ranch operations continued until the university acquired the property around 1960.</p>
<p>Other artifacts found in the area at various times have included tools, horse shoes, an oxen yoke, clothing fasteners, dishware, animal bones, shells, a large, intact pig trough, dishes and bottles believed to date to the 1860s, pieces of a cast-iron Cook House stove, boot soles, and an enameled "Mt. Diablo Cement Agency" sign in excellent condition.</p>
<p>Most of these artifacts aren't valuable in terms of money, said Morgan.</p>
<p>"It's really the information they provide that's of interest," she said. "You can find out so much more about how people lived if you have the archeological material."</p>
<p>To answer questions about what life was like in the past, it is critical to the archaeologist to know the locations in which archaeological artifacts are found, and their physical relationships in the ground and to historic structures and features, she said.</p>
<p>It's important people understand that bottle hunting or other disturbance of archaeological sites is destructive to the historic record, she added.</p>
<p>Any ground-disturbing work done within the new historic district now must be accompanied by the presence of an archeological monitor, said Morgan. But even outside the district, the practice of having a monitor on site is common, she said. If the monitor finds something important, work is stopped or redirected elsewhere on the project while the monitor performs data recovery.</p>
<p>Monitors are generally contractors from local firms such as Pacific Legacy of Santa Cruz. UCSC has no staff archeologists, though there are professors with archeological expertise, said Morgan.</p>
<p>Morgan's hope with the walking tour, exhibit, and Friends group is to develop grassroots support for restoration of some of the historic buildings. Once they're functional buildings, she thinks there could be the potential of campus money to maintain them.</p>
<p>"I'd love to see that happen," said Morgan. "The site is so complex and so evocative of 19th century history on the campus."</p>
<p>And that history has never come fully to light, she said.</p>
<p>"The importance of the site is not well known and hasn't been publicized well," Morgan said, despite long-term interest and efforts by local historians such as Perry and many other community members. "I think the historic district is a resource for students and the community that's very much underused and undervalued."</p>

Conducted by Thompson Scientific and published in the January/February edition of <a href="http://www.sciencewatch.com"><em>Science Watch</em></a>, the survey looked at an elite selection of "high-impact" papers published between 2002 and 2006--those ranking among the top 1 percent in the field for the number of times they have been cited, or referred to, in other research papers.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz had the highest score of any institution for the number of citations per high-impact paper. When ranked by total number of citations, UCSC came in at number 26, just missing the list of the top 25 institutions, according to <em>Science Watch</em> editor Christopher King. The campus's top score for citations per paper resulted from the participation of UCSC researchers in a comparatively small number of highly cited reports as identified in the survey, King said.</p>
<p>In addition, two researchers at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering--James Kent and David Haussler--were ranked fourth and ninth, respectively, on the list of authors with the most high-impact papers in this field.</p>
<p>UCSC's strong showing in this survey reflects the involvement of Haussler, Kent, and their colleagues at UCSC's <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a> (CBSE) in many of the most important recent papers in the field of molecular biology and genetics. These include the most-cited paper in the survey, a 2002 report in <em>Nature</em> on the mouse genome, which has now been cited more than 1,700 times. Of the more than 200 coauthors of the paper, 12 were affiliated with UCSC.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see that the mouse genome paper is the most cited," said Kent, a CBSE associate research scientist. "I did personally put a lot of work into that paper."</p>
<p>Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the CBSE, said the sequencing of the mouse genome was important because it enabled a comparative analysis with the human genome. "It was the first time we were able to compare the genomes of two widely separated mammals. That was the beginning of our research on comparative genomics and led to a lot of exciting papers down the line," he said.</p>
<p>Haussler was a coauthor of 10 of the 13 high-impact papers from UCSC. Kent was a coauthor of 12 of those papers, including two on which he was the lead author. Although several of these high-impact papers were, like the mouse paper, large collaborative efforts with long lists of coauthors, other high-impact papers reported work done primarily at UCSC.</p>
<p>"Some of those are very much home-grown initiatives from our lab that we did the bulk of the research on," Haussler said. He also noted that the period covered in the survey just missed the 2001 publication of the human genome sequence, another highly cited paper that his group was involved in.</p>
<p>Haussler has been a pioneer in the field of bioinformatics, which brings the power of advanced computational techniques to bear on complex problems in molecular biology. He and Kent played a crucial role in the completion of the human genome sequence by an international consortium, and their group has since been involved in other major genome sequencing efforts. Kent, who earned his Ph.D. in molecular biology at UCSC, created the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool used by biomedical researchers throughout the world.</p>
<p>"The Genome Browser and some of the other tools that Jim [Kent] has built are so widely used and have had such an impact, he is kind of a folk hero in this field for building these tools and making them available for other people to use," Haussler said. "Bioinformatics is having a huge impact on molecular biology and genetics; it's a major force in the field, and that really comes through in this survey."</p>
<p>The other trend Haussler noted in the list of UCSC's high-impact papers is the importance of comparative genomics. By comparing the genomes of different organisms using sophisticated computational analyses, Haussler's group has made important findings in several areas. These analyses have yielded clues about the evolutionary history of mammals and other vertebrates, and have also identified important regions in the human genome sequence that were previously unrecognized.</p>
<p>"We have discovered that many regions that had been called 'junk DNA' were actually conserved over long periods of evolution, suggesting that they are biologically important," Haussler said.</p>
<p>Several other UC campuses were highly ranked in the <em>Science Watch</em> survey: UC San Diego (fifth for total number of citations), UC Berkeley (seventh), and UC San Francisco (15th).</p>

A redwood that stands next to the appropriately named Redwood Building at Quarry Plaza lost 60 feet of its top. The foliage fell across a corner of the roof and across the deck. Another redwood lost a 50-foot crown, which dropped onto the Cowell Provost's house. A large oak fell over near the East Remote parking lot, and three redwoods fell by Family Student Housing. A huge Douglas fir dropped near the Moore Creek drainage by Graduate Student Housing, and a cypress was lost on Cardiff Lane. Several trees fell across fire roads in the upper campus, Raven said.</p><p>In December, before the storm, the campus tree crew had trimmed dozen of trees along roads and pathways. Raven said a regular preventive maintenance program managed by campus arborist Roger Edberg kept tree damage to a minimum, but this was a very strong storm. </p><p>During and after the storm, crews cleared roads, culverts, trails, and paths. Raven said crews even asked to work Sunday, a request he readily agreed to. By Monday, when students began returning, most of the fallen material was cleared. "I was very impressed," he said.</p><p> </p><p>Ilse Kolbus, director of physical plant, said she was amazed both by the amount of fallen trees and limbs and at how quickly it was cleared. </p><p>At one point, the campus street sweeper could progress only 100 feet before its bin was full, said Raven. Driver Ron Diethrick would dump the bin in the middle of the road to be picked up by a skip loader driven by Frank Locatelli and trucked away. The sweeper could then continue on for another 100 feet before filling again.</p><p>Raven said the debris would be "green cycled," with trees and limbs chipped and other materials such as redwood duff used in landscaping either on campus or through the city of Santa Cruz green cycling program.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154b8698072704601a012ffdd5ea90e"><name>1868</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sea otter study reveals striking variability in diets and feeding strategies</title><summary>Scientists studying southern sea otters at different sites in California's coastal waters were not surprised to find that the dietary diversity of the population is higher where food is limited.

<p>The new findings by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (online January 14 and in a later print issue). The study found that all sea otters in an area with abundant food resources share the same dietary preferences. Where food is limited, however, a diverse array of feeding strategies emerges, with individual sea otters specializing in particular types of prey.</p>
<p>Tim Tinker, a UCSC research biologist and first author of the paper, said the study has both theoretical implications for the science of ecology and practical implications for wildlife management.</p>
<p>"The traditional way of viewing the relationships between predators and prey and how food webs are structured may be oversimplified," Tinker said. "When you look at the population as a whole, you may see a diversification of the diet in response to limited food resources. But when you look at individuals, you see dietary specialization."</p>
<p>One implication of this dietary specialization for California sea otters is that some otters may be exposed to certain food-borne pathogens much more frequently than otters with different diets. "A lot of sea otters in the Central Coast population are dying from infectious diseases, and this could help us to better understand that disease mortality by allowing us to pinpoint the specific vectors of disease transmission," Tinker said.</p>
<p>Tinker's coauthors on the paper are Gena Bentall, who worked on the study as a UCSC graduate student and is now with the Monterey Bay Aquarium's sea otter research and conservation group; and James Estes, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a wildlife ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. The study compared sea otters on the Central Coast, which has the largest population of southern sea otters, to those in a much smaller population around San Nicolas Island off the coast of Southern California.</p>
<p>The San Nicolas population is the result of an effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reduce the vulnerability of California sea otters to oil spills by establishing a separate population from the main one on the Central Coast. In the late 1980s, about 140 sea otters were relocated to San Nicolas Island. Most of them soon returned to the mainland, but the few that remained have prospered. With plenty of food to go around, the San Nicolas otters are in better shape than their mainland counterparts, and their population is now growing much faster than the Central Coast population.</p>
<p>"The San Nicolas otters are much bigger than the mainland animals, their body condition is better, and they spend less time feeding," Tinker said. "When we looked at individual diets, a few key prey types dominated, and each otter's diet looked pretty much like every other otter's diet."</p>
<p>The otters' preferred prey are the large, energy-rich red sea urchins, which are abundant around San Nicolas Island. On the Central Coast, red sea urchins are much less common than the smaller purple sea urchins. The San Nicolas otters also eat marine snails and crabs, but there is little difference between the population as a whole and individual otters in terms of dietary diversity. Each otter is a generalist, with the same preferences as other otters.</p>
<p>The mainland population is dramatically different. While the diet of the population as a whole is much more diversified than at San Nicolas, individual diets are more specialized. Estes said it is not surprising that animals are highly individual in the way they feed, but the link between individual specialization and resource availability is new.</p>
<p>"What's new in this paper is that individuality is a plastic characteristic that emerges when resources become limited," Estes said. "We're seeing this in sea otters, but it probably occurs broadly in nature. It may apply to people, too. When there were just a few people running around on the face of the Earth, they were probably all doing pretty much the same thing."</p>
<p>Individuality in feeding behavior adds a new level of complexity to the dynamics of food webs. For wildlife managers, it means that each animal has to be considered as an individual and may not be representative of the whole population. But the findings also suggest a potentially useful tool for assessing the status of wildlife populations, Estes said.</p>
<p>"It's very hard to know where a population stands with respect to resource limitation; we're always asking if a population is limited by the availability of food," he said. "We could conceivably look for individuality in foraging behavior as an indication that food limitation is an important factor."</p>
<p>According to Estes, scientists were already convinced before this study was completed that the availability of food is limiting the Central Coast sea otter population. He said the same situation probably prevailed throughout California before fur traders began hunting sea otters in the 18th century, eventually driving them to the brink of extinction. But it is not clear why sea otters are not spreading out into other areas along the California coast where they would find more food than on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>"Why this population does not expand into food rich areas is one of the perplexing challenges we have not been able to figure out," Estes said.</p>

Last fall, girls in grades six through eight at Mission Hill, Branciforte, and Shoreline Middle Schools enrolled in the semester-long, after-school program called "Full of Ourselves" (FOO). </p><p>The class was offered through <a href="http://www.healthygirlssc.org/">Healthy Girls Santa Cruz</a>, a program conceived by Wise-Levine that provides year-round services to support girls' healthy development. "There are a lot of mean girls and put-downs, and junior high is the worst," said Jo Ann Allen, director of student support services for the Santa Cruz County Office of Education (SCCOE). </p><p>Allen likes the FOO curriculum because it focuses on improving girls' self-image, with an emphasis on developing positive coping skills, healthier eating and exercise habits, and teaching girls leadership skills. "I liked the subtlety of the approach," said Allen, who calls the middle school years "a really important developmental stage." </p><p>"It's a lot like early childhood in terms of the cognitive development going on. They want to fit in, to be liked, and they're trying to figure out who they are," she said, adding that contrary to popular belief, children ages 11-15 need as much guidance as preschoolers.</p><p>Developed at Harvard as an eating-disorder prevention program, the goal of the FOO curriculum is to build self-esteem by helping girls develop communication and leadership skills. "Relationships are vital to girls, especially at this age," said Wise-Levine. "School is all about academics, but there are other important types of learning that take place in early adolescence." FOO helps girls learn skills essential to becoming a healthy adult, including communication and assertiveness, she said.</p><p>In addition, the curriculum covers <a href="http://www.healthygirlssc.org/">media literacy training</a>, so girls can become critical consumers of media images of girls and women, and it encourages healthy eating and exercise habits as part of an overall focus on health and well-being. "Eating disorders are one end of a spectrum of problematic body image and eating issues for girls," said Wise-Levine, who cited statistics that underscore the need to address the issues:</p><p>. Sixty percent of teen girls are on a diet</p><p>. Preteen girls are more afraid of fat than cancer</p><p>. Forty-five percent of women who smoke say they use it as a form of weight control</p><p>"All girls struggle with body dissatisfaction, whether they're fat, thin, or in between," said Wise-Levine, adding that 43 percent of normal-weight 13-year-old girls are trying to lose weight. Many girls subscribe to the "myth of a malleable body," rather than accept themselves as they are. "They learn it from adults," she added, noting that Americans spend $50 billion annually on diet and weight-loss products.</p><p>Poor self-esteem is the root cause of many problems faced by girls in the county's support programs, said Allen, who hopes programs like FOO will reach girls before they make bad choices. "It's so clear--if you feel good about yourself, you can conquer the world. But a lot of girls in our society need help getting to that point," she said.</p><p>The original FOO curriculum was tested in 24 schools in the Northeast, where participating students showed increased body image, body satisfaction, and self-esteem after taking the class, according to Wise-Levine. The curriculum includes art activities, role playing, discussion, yoga, and guided meditation. Wise-Levine expanded the yoga component for the Santa Cruz program, and many students told her the class was the one part of the week they looked forward to. </p><p>"They really appreciated having a space just for girls, where they felt safe to express their feelings and be who they are," said Wise-Levine, adding that the challenges facing girls include grappling with the need to fit in, stress about schoolwork, concerns about being judged, boys, cliques, and their relationships with family members and other girls. </p><p>Yoga offered physical benefits and boosted the girls' "sense of personal power," according to Wise-Levine, 27, a yoga instructor and former outdoor educator. "Yoga helps people cope with emotions by learning to be mindful," she said. "It helps people become aware of the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that come up as they're doing the postures, and they can learn to allow, honor, and recognize those feelings." Wise-Levine was impressed by how readily her students embraced those lessons. "I had girls tell me that they are now able to notice their feelings and think about how to act most appropriately in response to those feelings, not just in yoga but in their lives. That's what mindfulness is all about."</p><p>Wise-Levine earned academic credit for teaching the classes, and the project satisfied the six-month field-study required of all community studies majors at UCSC. Working with middle-school girls was rewarding, even when it was challenging, she said. "My sense of strength and self-worth increased as I was trying to guide these girls in developing their own sense of agency and power," she said.</p><p>For Allen, working with Wise-Levine has been a joy. "I've had interns before, but they've all worked within my existing programs," she said. "This was the first time a student came to me with a proposal for her own project. She'd been searching for a way to bring this program to students. She has a passion for this work."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154ca378072704601a012ffd67de40c"><name>1877</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Field or classroom, Soccer Slugs are on the ball</title><summary>Slug soccer has scored goals on and off the field recently with recognition and honors bestowed by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA).</summary><keywords>Slug soccer, National Soccer Coaches Association of America</keywords><description>Slug soccer has scored goals on and off the field recently with recognition and honors bestowed by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA).</description><start-date>1200553200000</start-date><display-name>Field or classroom, Soccer...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1877</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1877</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338507265</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338507265</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/01/images/ramirez.womens.soccer.240.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/01/images/ramirez.womens.soccer.240.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez.womens.soccer.240.jpg</name><file-size>120708</file-size><width>240</width><height>251</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Slug soccer offensive midfielder senior captain Didi Ramirez holds off her defender before she turns to goal in a September match against Westmont College.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/01/images/kono.mens.soccer.240.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/01/images/kono.mens.soccer.240.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kono.mens.soccer.240.jpg</name><file-size>9148</file-size><width>240</width><height>158</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz's sophomore midfielder Davin Kono brings the ball upfield in a September game against Simpson University.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Slug soccer has scored goals on and off the field recently with recognition and honors bestowed by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA).</p>

Since Peace Corps' inception, 638 UCSC alumni have joined the ranks, making it the no. 61 producer of volunteers of all time, according to data from the Peace Corps San Francisco Regional Office. </p><p>UCSC's high ranking doesn't surprise UCSC alumna Robin Smith, 27, of Santa Rosa, who will depart for Moldova in late February to begin her 27-month assignment as an agribusiness volunteer with the Peace Corps. </p><p>"My experience in Santa Cruz was that there are a lot of worldly people," said Smith. "Many of my classmates had traveled to other countries. And there's a lot of student activism and people working in volunteer organizations on campus." </p><p>Smith graduated in 2003 with a degree in politics and went on to earn a master's degree in political economy from the University College of London.</p><p>She wanted to join the Peace Corps because of her regional interest in Central Europe, "which was cultivated in large part by professors at UC Santa Cruz," she said.</p><p>For the purposes of the Peace Corps' ranking, small schools are those with less than 5,000 undergraduates, medium-size schools have between 5,001 to 15,000 undergraduates, and large schools more than 15,000 undergraduates. The full 2008 Peace Corps Top College rankings are available on the organization's <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov">web site</a>.</p><p>In the graduate school rankings, UCSC ranked no. 54 with four alumni with advanced degrees serving as volunteers. </p><p>There are 1,192 institutions of higher learning represented by Peace Corps volunteers serving in 74 countries overseas, according to Peace Corps Director Ron Tschetter. </p><p>"The Peace Corps provides a unique opportunity for graduates to use their education and skills, and apply them in the real world," said Tschetter. </p><p>Overall, UC Berkeley has produced the most Peace Corps volunteers since 1961 with an all-time total of 3,326. </p><p>Several UC institutions--UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, and UC Davis--are in the top-25 Peace Corps ranking for large campuses.  </p><p>This year, there are more than 8,000 volunteers abroad, a 37-year high for volunteers in the field. Since 1961, more than 190,000 volunteers have helped promote a better understanding between Americans and the people of the 139 countries where volunteers have served. </p><p>Informational meetings about the Peace Corps are held on campus throughout the year for those thinking about becoming volunteers. The next meetings will take place on Monday, February 4, and Monday, March 3, from 5:30 to 7 p.m. at Baobob Lounge at Merrill College.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154d01e8072704601a012ff30cfefce"><name>1881</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>LUNAFEST film festival comes to the Rio Theater Jan. 26</title><summary>LUNAFEST, a fundraising film festival dedicated to promoting awareness about women's issues, highlighting women filmmakers, and bringing women together in their communities, will take place at the Rio Theater  on Saturday, January 26, from 7 to 9 p.m.</summary><keywords>LUNAFEST 2008</keywords><description>LUNAFEST, a fundraising film festival dedicated to promoting awareness about women's issues, highlighting women filmmakers, and bringing women together in their communities, will take place at the Rio Theater  on Saturday, January 26, from 7 to 9 p.m.</description><start-date>1200639600000</start-date><display-name>LUNAFEST film festival comes...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1881</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1881</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338508731</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338508731</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/01/images/lunafest.280.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/01/images/lunafest.280.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lunafest.280.jpg</name><file-size>52446</file-size><width>280</width><height>268</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>LUNAFEST, a fundraising film festival dedicated to promoting awareness about women's issues, highlighting women filmmakers, and bringing women together in their communities, will take place at the Rio Theater on Saturday, January 26, from 7 to 9 p.m.</p>

<p>Hosted by the UCSC Student Environmental Center and the UCSC Sustainability Office, the Campus Earth Summit brings together students, staff, faculty, and administrators to challenge the growing threat of climate change and update the "Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus." This year, the Earth Summit takes place in conjunction with "Focus the Nation" events at more than 1,550 institutions nationwide, designed to move the debate on climate change from talk to action.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has long been a leader in environmental education and action. The Summit, whose theme is "Local Solutions to Climate Change," will feature presentations from Chancellor George Blumenthal; Santa Cruz County Treasurer Fred Keeley; Professor Daniel Press, chair of the Environmental Studies department; Matthew St. Clair, sustainability manger for the UC Office of the President; UC Student Regent Ben Allen; UCSC Sustainability Coordinator Aurora Winslade; and student activists.</p>
<p>Attendees will enjoy an organic lunch made from locally grown ingredients. Discussion groups in the afternoon will facilitate the formation of working groups on such issues as Campus Community Connections, Campus Food Systems, Social Justice, Renewable Energy, Curriculum Development, Waste Prevention, Green Building, Green Purchasing, and Transportation. The groups will assess the progress of current sustainability efforts, including a review of the newly published "UCSC Sustainability Assessment" action items, as well as collaborate on creative solutions for the future. The outcome will be used to update the "Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus," a manifesto that envisions a sustainable future for UC Santa Cruz.</p>

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, discovered that female lark buntings show strong preferences for certain traits in the males, but those preferences change from year to year.</p>
<p>Classic examples of sexual selection involve elaborate ornaments, such as the peacock's tail, that evolve as a result of consistent female preferences, so that males with the most exaggerated traits have the most success mating and produce more offspring than less flamboyant competitors. In the case of lark buntings, however, the flexibility shown by females in choosing their mates dampens the trend toward more elaborate ornamentation and may instead maintain variability in male plumage.</p>
<p>"It's counter to the conventional view of female choice as static," said Bruce Lyon, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and coauthor of the paper. "These females are capable of very sophisticated behavior, and they appear to benefit from their flexibility in mate choice by gaining enhanced nesting success."</p>
<p>The study suggests that the male's plumage somehow serves as a signal to the female that he possesses certain traits that will affect the pair's nesting success. Shifting environmental conditions may determine which male traits matter most in any given year, said Alexis Chaine, who worked on the study as a UCSC graduate student and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Center for Scientific Research) in France. Chaine is first author of the paper, which appears in the January 25 issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>"The traits the female is choosing somehow predict how successful the pair will be in nesting," Chaine said. "One possibility is that certain traits are associated with the male being a good forager, and other traits predict how well he could defend the nest from predators. So, if there are lots of ground squirrels, which are a major nest predator, she wants a good defender, but in a year when grasshopper populations are low, she needs a good provider. These are ideas we still need to test."</p>
<p>With a mostly black body and bright white wing patches, the male lark bunting is a distinctive bird of the Great Plains. Females choose a new mate every year, and parenting duties are shared by both members of the pair. The males are territorial during the breeding season, flying up over their territory and singing as they descend to attract a mate. Once they acquire a mate, however, they no longer defend the territory. The researchers found no correlation between the quality of a male's territory and his success in attracting a mate.</p>
<p>The white wing patches and other male plumage traits serve as signals in aggressive interactions between territorial males, Chaine said, meaning that female mate choice is not the only factor influencing those traits. But the researchers found that the role of those signals in competitive interactions between males was consistent from year to year. The level of aggression didn't vary between years either.</p>
<p>"Male competition can't explain the overall pattern, but it may be an important factor in the evolution of male plumage traits," Chaine said.</p>
<p>The variability of the male plumage was one of the first things Lyon noticed when he began studying lark buntings on the Pawnee National Grasslands in Colorado. (The lark bunting is the state bird of Colorado.) Chaine joined Lyon the following year and began an exhaustive long-term study, gathering data from 1999 to 2003.</p>
<p>"We had to conduct studies every year over several years before we could see what was going on," Lyon said. "We saw two patterns of variation in the correlations between male traits and female mate choice. In some cases, it was either on or off--a trait was important to females one year and not important in other years. We also saw reversals--for example, one year the females preferred males with bigger wing patches, and the next year they preferred smaller wing patches."</p>
<p>Lyon cautioned that additional experiments are needed to provide definitive evidence of female preferences. The study was based on statistical correlations, which provide clear evidence that the traits of mated males differ from those of males without mates. "We suspect it's because females are choosing males with particular traits," Lyon said. "Ideally, we would like to test that with field experiments."</p>
<p>The dynamic sexual selection seen in lark buntings is probably occurring in other species as well, he added. That has implications for theoretical models of how sexual selection influences the evolution of male traits.</p>
<p>"The assumption that sexual selection is static is something we've all taken for granted," Chaine said. "This study might cause some people to rethink their systems and take another look at their data."</p>
<p>This research was supported by grants from the National Geographic Society, National Science Foundation, American Museum of Natural History, Sigma Xi, and the American Ornithologist's Union.</p>

(Photo by Guy Lasnier)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the completion of a new fiber-optic project, members of the campus community will be able to tap into an ultra-high-speed Internet network with much greater capacity than the campus's current connection.</p>
<p>The groundwork for the connection is expected to be in place by this time next year. The initial installation will provide a 10-fold increase in speed over the current connection, and will initially improve the campus's core network loop.</p>
<p>The tie-in to the California Research &amp; Education Network 2 (CalREN 2) backbone also brings the potential for high-speed Internet connections for other schools, colleges, governments, and businesses in Santa Cruz County, Chancellor George Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>"It is a huge boost for the competitive advantage of UC Santa Cruz and the Monterey Bay Area, and has the potential to fuel the local economy and enable new opportunities for the City of Santa Cruz," Blumenthal said at a kick-off event January 24.</p>
<p>The dramatic increase in network connection speeds will be made possible by stringing nearly 30 miles of fiber-optic cable from Sunnyvale to Santa Cruz. High cost and treacherous terrain prevented UCSC from joining CalREN earlier.</p>
<p>"Having all the UC campuses connected to the network backbone is absolutely necessary," said Kris Hafner, associate vice president, information resources &amp; communication, UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>UC Office of the President agreed to fund the $5.5 million project after Blumenthal persuaded them of its necessity, said Larry Merkley, UCSC vice provost, information technology. "It gives UCSC a new era of research capability and competitive edge," he said.</p>
<p>CalREN is operated by a nonprofit corporation known as CENIC, the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California. Its president, Jim Dolgonas, said the fiber-optic network links campuses throughout the state and will have important implications for researchers.</p>
<p>Professor Stan Woosley explained how astronomers in Santa Cruz will be able to work with the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii without leaving their desks.</p>
<p>Margaret Morse, acting dean of the Arts, said students in the Digital Arts and New Media program will be able to use the increased bandwidth to collaborate on projects around the country and the world.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the last of the 10 UC campuses to be linked to the network. The cable work is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The 2008 season will combine Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>All's Well That Ends Well</em> with two contemporary American plays--<em>Burn This</em>, by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Lanford Wilson, and <em>Bach at Leipzig</em>, by the critically acclaimed young playwright, Itamar Moses.</p>
<p>It's all part of Barricelli's plan to continue SSC's time-honored tradition of presenting inventive interpretations of Shakespearean plays, while at the same time putting a new emphasis on contemporary works by American playwrights.</p>
<p>"That we can explore new and exciting directions theatrically is a direct result of the strong artistic foundation Paul (Whitworth) has brought to SSC during his leadership," said Barricelli, who took over the reins as SSC's artistic director on January 1. An acclaimed actor with a national reputation for performances in both Shakespearean and modern roles, Barricelli spent eight seasons with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival as an actor and seven years as an associate artist with the American Conservatory Theatre (A.C.T.) in San Francisco.</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> will be directed by Kim Rubinstein (<em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>, 2007), who considers Shakespeare's tragic tale of star-crossed lovers betrayed by an adult world as "the greatest love story ever written" and still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>"At the heart of the play, the ultimate tragedy occurs because the adults didn't listen or listened too late," says Rubinstein. "It is in the small moments of our everyday lives--moments where we don't treat each other with kindness and compassion and listening--that is where the seeds of violence begin." The former associate artistic director of Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, Rubinstein now serves on the faculty of the Theater &amp; Dance Department at UC San Diego where she heads the undergraduate acting program.</p>
<p><em>All's Well That Ends Well</em> will be directed by SSC veteran Tim Ocel, who notes that the play explores the question of nobility--"are you born with it or do you achieve it through your actions?" It tells the story of Helena, a woman whose love for Bertram is unflappable but goes unrequited until her dogged persistence and clever wit finally allow her to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>"This play is on a very human scale; there are no heroics and it is brutally honest," says Ocel, who is based in St. Louis where he directs theater and opera. Ocel is an artistic associate at Geva Theater Center in Rochester, New York, and associate professor of opera at the University of Kansas--Lawrence.</p>
<p>Lanford Wilson's <em>Burn This</em> premiered in New York in 1987 with Joan Allen and John Malkovich in starring roles; Allen won a Tony Award for her performance. The play is set in a lower-Manhattan loft where Anna, a dancer and budding choreographer, her screenwriter boyfriend Burton, and her gay roommate Larry, are recovering from the tragic death of Anna and Larry's roommate Robbie--a talented young dancer. They encounter Pale, Robbie's charismatic older brother, and their lives become irrevocably changed. It's a witty, engaging, and painfully human story by Wilson, whose <em>Talley's Folly</em> received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979.</p>
<p><em>Burn This</em> will be directed by Michael Barakiva, who has worked with the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, Arena Stage, and New Dramatists. A winner of the David Merrick Prize in Drama, Barakiva is based in New York City and will be making his SSC directorial debut.</p>
<p><em>Bach at Leipzig</em> was written by 30-year-old playwright Itamar Moses, who is considered one of the leading new voices in American theater, and whose work has been compared to that of Tom Stoppard. Moses made his mark with this brilliantly written, farcical tale of "a bunch of average guys trying to get ahead in their chosen profession."</p>
<p><em>Bach at Leipzig</em> will be directed by Art Manke, co-founder of A Noise Within, L.A.'s acclaimed classical theater company, where he served as artistic director for its first 10 seasons. Manke directed the acclaimed 2006 production of this play at South Coast Repertory, where he won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Direction.</p>
<p>All four plays will be performed in repertory from July 15 through August 31. Subscriptions for the 2008 season go on sale in mid-April; single tickets will be available in May. For more information, call the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159 or visit the SSC web site at http://shakespearesantacruz.org.</p>

<p>The troupe's performances are just part of the celebration of Black History Month on campus, which included the Jan. 30 <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1800">Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation</a> and will feature performances, a documentary, concerts and lectures, and more.</p>

<p><em>The Trial of One Short-Sighted Black Woman vs. Mammy Louise and Safreeta Mae,</em> which features an imaginary courtroom that examines persistent stereotypes, will be performed in February and March, and is a presentation of the UCSC Theater Arts Department.</p>
<p>The Broadway gospel play, written by Karani M. Leslie and directed by Don Williams, brings up the "Aunt Jemima figure" and the black prostitute as stereotypes. A young, upwardly mobile black woman brings a lawsuit to the imaginary court, complaining that jokes at her expense are based on these demeaning character types. Since there is really no courtroom, the prosecutor and defender can summon any witnesses they want, real or imaginary, and get the whole truth from them.</p>
<p>The show will be performed at the UCSC Stevenson College Event Center at 7 p.m. on February 22-23 and at 3 p.m. February 24. Tickets are $12 for general admission, $9 UCSC students and seniors.</p>
<p>The troupe will also perform off campus at 7 p.m. February 29 and March 1 at Santa Cruz High School. Tickets are $12 for general admission and $9 for UCSC students and seniors. In addition, there will be a performance at 7 p.m. on March 15 at the Oldemeyer Center in Seaside.</p>
<p>The African American Theater Arts Troupe, directed by Don Williams, is designed to enhance the climate of the cultural diversity on the campus and in the community. The group also encourages the development of abilities through annual scholarship awards. It has raised and awarded more than $60,000 in scholarships to UCSC students who work with the African American Theater Arts Troupe.</p>

The application deadline for the program is Tuesday, February 19.  </p><p>   </p><p>CUIP is entering its 15th year as a prestigious internship program at UCSC. The program provides undergraduate students with professional internships in various oncampus units. Opportunities range from the Good Neighbor Intern working with Community Relations to internships in the Cowell Student Health Center working with the Student Health Outreach Programs. For the 2008-09 year, there are a number of internships in the areas of social justice and diversity and sustainability. Over 30 internship proposals can be viewed <a href="http://intern.ucsc.edu/cuip">online.</a> CUIP pays an intern's student fees for a full nine-month academic year.  </p><p>CUIP is a unique program designed for highly qualified students who desire to participate in a challenging oncampus project with a specific goal to be reached by the year's end. Interns take a two-quarter, two-unit class led by the dean of Undergraduate Education, Bill Ladusaw. </p><p>The class, required of all CUIP interns, is titled <i>Teamwork and Institution Building</i> and is held every Monday from 5-7 p.m. in the fall and spring quarters.  The class is designed to enhance the educational value of the interns' experience by insuring that interns reflect on the goals, potential impact, and outcomes of the projects.  Interns get the chance to develop an understanding of the complexities and context of UCSC as an institution and are rewarded with an understanding of how their projects contribute to UCSC's mission and effectiveness. </p><p>The format of the class varies slightly during each of the terms.  Some meetings are composed of presentations and discussions, while other evenings include presentations by campus administrators and discussions about current issues at UCSC. At the end of each term, interns are expected to give formal presentations about their projects.</p><p>Applicants must be in good standing and submit two letters of recommendation, along with a cover letter, resume, and online application. Applicants may apply for up to four internships. </p><p>       </p><p>For more information about the program and read intern success stories, visit the <a href="http://intern.ucsc.edu/cuip">CUIP web site.</a> Additionally, you may contact the Career Center Internship Program Team at (831) 459-3973 or <a href="mailto:cuip@ucsc.edu">cuip@ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154ebfe8072704601a012ff83bc8a34"><name>1899</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student regents urge UCSC students to apply</title><summary>Benjamin Allen, the UC law student who sits on the Board of Regents, and D'Artagnan Scorza, who will take the post July 1, visited UCSC Friday to urge students to apply. &#13;

The student regent sits on the board for a year after serving in a non-voting role as designate for a year. </p><p>Allen, enrolled at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall, and Scorza, a Ph.D. candidate in education at UCLA, are visiting all UC 10 campuses to encourage student regent applications. Allen, who sported a "100% Slug" button during his daylong visit, noted that he would have to alter it to "10% Slug" when visiting other campuses. </p><p>Allen and Scorza met with faculty and administrators at a breakfast hosted by Chancellor Blumenthal. They talked with students at the Student Union during a lunch sponsored by the Student Union Assembly and Graduate Student Association and later held a press conference with student journalists. </p><p>During the breakfast, Allen said he is concerned over whether the University of California can maintain quality, accessibility, affordability and service given the current state budget situation.  He called on the governor and legislature to continue to "invest in quality."

According to a new study, the black hole's gravitational pull on the white dwarf would cause tidal forces sufficient to disrupt the stellar remnant and reignite nuclear burning in it, giving rise to a supernova explosion with an unusual appearance. Observations of such supernovae could confirm the existence of intermediate-mass black holes, currently the subject of much debate among astronomers.</p>
<p>"Our supercomputer simulations show a peculiar supernova that would be a unique signature of an intermediate-mass black hole," said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz and his collaborators--Stephan Rosswog of Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany, and William Hix of Oak Ridge National Laboratory--used detailed computer simulations to follow the entire process of tidal disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole. Their simulations included gas dynamics, gravity, and nuclear physics, requiring weeks of computer time to simulate events that would take place in a fraction of a second. A paper describing their results has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, and a preprint is currently available online.</p>
<p>"Every star that is not too massive ends up as a white dwarf, so they are very common. We were interested in whether tidal disruption can bring this stellar corpse to life again," said Rosswog, the first author of the paper.</p>
<p>A white dwarf can explode as a "type Ia" supernova if it accumulates enough mass by siphoning matter away from a companion star. When it reaches a critical mass (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun), the white dwarf collapses and explodes. Astronomers use these type Ia supernovae as "standard candles" for cosmic distance measurements because their brightness evolves over time in a predictable manner.</p>
<p>The new paper describes a distinctly different mechanism for igniting a white dwarf, in which tidal disruption by a black hole causes drastic compression of the stellar material. The white dwarf is flattened into a pancake shape aligned in the plane of its orbit around the black hole. As each section of the star is squeezed through a point of maximum compression, the extreme pressure causes a sharp increase in temperatures, which triggers explosive burning.</p>
<p>The explosion ejects more than half of the debris from the disrupted star, while the rest of the stellar material falls into the black hole. The infalling material forms a luminous accretion disk that emits x-rays and should be detectable by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the researchers said.</p>
<p>"This is a new mechanism for ignition of a white dwarf that results in a very different type of supernova than the standard type Ia, and it is followed by an x-ray source," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>He estimated that this type of event would occur about 100 times less frequently than the standard type Ia supernovae, but should be detectable by future surveys designed to observe large numbers of supernovae. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), planned for completion in 2013, is expected to discover hundreds of thousands of type Ia supernovae per year.</p>
<p>"These exotic creatures will start showing up in the data from the LSST," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "We want to predict the light curves so we can look for them in the survey data."</p>
<p>The mechanism described in the paper requires a black hole that is neither too small nor too big. Such intermediate-mass black holes (500 to 1,000 times the mass of the Sun) may reside in some globular star clusters, but there is much less evidence for their existence than there is for the relatively small stellar black holes (tens of times the mass of the Sun) or for supermassive black holes (a few million times the mass of the Sun), found at the centers of galaxies.</p>
<p>The new paper describes in detail the disruption of a white dwarf with two-tenths the mass of the Sun by a black hole 1,000 times the mass of the Sun. The researchers also found that they can vary the mass of the white dwarf and still get the same outcome--tidal disruption and ignition of the white dwarf.</p>
<p>"We can ignite the whole mass range of white dwarfs if they get close enough to the black hole," Rosswog said.</p>
<p>This research was supported by the Department of Energy's Program for Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing.</p>

If this proposal is approved, UC will face a $417 million system-wide shortfall when compared to the budget request submitted by UC Regents last November. The Regent's budget request proposed funding for growth in student enrollment, faculty and staff salaries and health benefit costs, and pressing program needs.</p><p>It will be months before we know exactly how much the system budget will be reduced this year or what share of that reduction will be borne by our campus. In the interim, here is what we do know:</p><p>. Our campus leadership will urge that UC funding be sustained to the greatest extent possible. We will welcome your help in making that case and in identifying ways to effectively continue our teaching, research, and public service endeavors within available resources.</p><p>. Given that offers of admission are extended in March, the Regents will soon need to determine what, if any, enrollment growth the system as a whole will absorb. For UCSC, I have proposed that we maintain first-year enrollment at current levels and continue to seek an increase in graduate enrollments.</p><p>. Our local budget planning will assume a significant reduction in state funding. I will direct principal officers to anticipate an estimated 10% reduction in core operating budgets. We will adapt our planning efforts as new information becomes available.</p><p>. We have weathered prior budget cuts, and we will survive these as well. As has historically been the case, we will focus on protecting instructional resources, maintaining momentum in recruiting outstanding faculty, and utilizing careful management strategies to preserve employment.</p><p>The budget challenge facing UC is significant. I know it is unsettling to hear about potential budget cuts without knowing how they might impact us collectively and individually. At this early stage, I wanted to simply acknowledge the challenge and promise to provide you with regular updates.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154f8858072704601a012ff8c53ce3f"><name>1907</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduate applications to UC Santa Cruz soar</title><summary>More high school seniors and prospective transfer students than ever applied to study at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for fall 2008.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831) 459-2495</author><keywords>Fall '08 applications</keywords><description>More high school seniors and prospective transfer students than ever applied to study at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for fall 2008.</description><start-date>1201590000000</start-date><display-name>Undergraduate applications to UC...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1907</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1907</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338519083</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338519083</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More high school seniors and prospective transfer students than ever applied to study at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for fall 2008.</p>
<p>Numbers released today by UC's Office of the President showed one-year increases at UCSC of 13.8 and 11.5 percent, respectively, in freshman and transfer applications. These increases compared to a UC systemwide increase of 9.2 in freshman applications and 8.5 percent in transfer applications received at the university's nine general campuses.</p>

"These numbers not only are testimony to the quality of UCSC's people and programs," said Michael McCawley, UCSC's acting director of admissions. "They reflect the growing awareness throughout California of that quality."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Prospective undergraduates submitted fall 2008 applications during the university's "priority filing" period of November 1-30.</p>
<p>During that month, a total of 27,810 prospective freshmen applied to UC Santa Cruz, compared with 24,436 applicants for fall 2007. A total of 5,245 applicants to UCSC are seeking to transfer from another college or university, up from 4,960 transfer applications for the previous fall.</p>
<p>Increases among prospective freshmen and transfer students were seen in applications in all five of UCSC's academic divisions: Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences. The largest increases were experienced in the Baskin School of Engineering (up 48 percent) and in Social Sciences (up 28.6 percent).</p>
<p>Among prospective freshmen, a new major in Engineering-Bioengineering-drew 413 applications in its first year; and in its second year, the Computer Game Design major attracted 462 applications. In Social Sciences, the Business Management Economics major attracted 2,233 applications, and Psychology drew 1,642 applications. In Physical and Biological Sciences, the Biology major attracted 1,774 applications; Marine Biology, 623; and Health Sciences, 542. In Humanities, applications in the Literature and History majors totaled 1,058 and 481, respectively. In the Arts, Film and Digital Media drew the interest of 608 applicants and the major in Art attracted 441.</p>
<p>Approximately one-third of the prospective freshmen applied to UCSC with an undeclared major.</p>
<p>Applications to the campus from traditionally underrepresented groups also increased, rising 25 and 9.7 percent, respectively, from prospective freshmen and transfer students.</p>
<p>"It's important that the ethnic diversity of UCSC's students more closely mirror the state we serve," McCawley said. "So we are very pleased to see gains of this size, particularly among prospective freshmen."</p>
<p>Among freshman applications to UCSC, all ethnic groups experienced increases for fall 2008: African American, from 759 last year to 972 this year, or 28.1 percent; American Indian, from 154 last year to 180 this year, or 16.9 percent; Asian American, from 9,215 to 10,144, or 10.1 percent; Chicano/Latino, from 7,290 to 9,262, or 24.8 percent; Filipino American, from 856 to 889, or 3.9 percent; and White/other, from 10,048 to 11,069, or 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>Applications from students who did not state an ethnicity also increased, from 1,095 to 1,321, or 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>For fall 2008, UC Santa Cruz is planning to enroll 3,700 new freshmen and 850 new transfer students. McCawley said this target for freshman enrollment remains the same as the number of enrolled freshmen in fall 2007; this target for transfer students is 50 more than the number who enrolled in fall 2007.</p>
<p>"Since our undergraduate enrollment targets are essentially unchanged from this past fall, the increase in applications will make our selection process more competitive than ever," McCawley said.</p>
<p>Applicants to UCSC will be notified of admission decisions beginning on March 15. Admitted freshmen will have until May 1 to file a "statement of intent to register," indicating their intention to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. The deadline for transfers is June 1.</p>

The University of California agreed to partner with Google on the project in 2006, and is one of 28 institutions in seven countries that will have the contents of their extensive libraries scanned by Google Book Search.</p><p>Since fall of 2006, Google has been digitizing books from UC's Northern Regional Library Facility, located in Richmond. With today's shipment from the collections held at UC Santa Cruz's McHenry Library, Google is now expanding its scanning activities to the UC campuses. Digitizing the entire UC library collection is expected to take approximately six years. </p><p>"Scanning the contents of the books in the UCSC Library is a great step forward in improving access to these materials for students, faculty, and other researchers," said University Librarian Virginia Steel. "This promises to significantly enhance their ability to identify relevant resources and to uncover materials that would otherwise have been hard to discover."  </p><p>Steel noted that shipments to Google will occur on a regular schedule and all of the books will be returned to the library once they are scanned. She said that items are expected to be off the shelf no longer than three weeks at a time.</p><p>"Scanning helps increase discovery of materials, but we know that people still prefer to read lengthy works in print formats rather than online," said Steel. "The Google scanning is a non-destructive process; the books are not damaged when they are scanned, and Google's track record for preserving the condition of materials is excellent."</p><p>As the books are scanned, they will be made available on the Google web site. Users will be able to freely view, browse, and read public domain books; for books protected by copyright, users will be provided with information such as a name, title, and where the books can be borrowed or purchased. Authors and publishers who choose not to have their books digitized will be excluded. </p><p>"We would not have been able to afford to digitize our library collections ourselves, so the partnership that UC has established with Google will allow us to accomplish a challenging goal that otherwise would have been difficult to reach," Steel added.</p><p></p><p>							</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154fdc58072704601a012ffb6bfc774"><name>1910</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jonathan Fox publishes new book about accountability politics</title><summary>In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Accountability Politics: Power and Voice in Rural Mexico&lt;/i&gt;, Latin American Studies professor Jonathan Fox explores how the seeds of accountability grow in authoritarian environments.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-4399; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>fox, mexico, accountability, politics, latin american and latino studies, LALS, books, publications</keywords><description>In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Accountability Politics: Power and Voice in Rural Mexico&lt;/i&gt;, Latin American Studies professor Jonathan Fox explores how the seeds of accountability grow in authoritarian environments.</description><start-date>1201676400000</start-date><display-name>Jonathan Fox publishes new...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1910</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1910</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338520465</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338520465</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/01/images/fox_jonathan.06_09_11.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/01/images/fox_jonathan.06_09_11.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fox_jonathan.06_09_11.jpg</name><file-size>17818</file-size><width>170</width><height>272</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jonathan Fox.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In his new book, <i>Accountability Politics: Power and Voice in Rural Mexico</i>, Latin American Studies professor Jonathan Fox explores how the seeds of accountability grow in authoritarian environments. </p><p>The process of embedding accountability into the state is inherently uneven, partial, and contested, according to Fox, who contends that campaigns for public accountability can leave cracks in the system that serve as handholds for subsequent efforts to open up the state to public scrutiny. </p><p>Fox, a leading expert on development policy and democratization, has conducted field research in Mexico since 1982. In <i>Accountability Politics</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, USA, 2008), he traces the "thickening" of rural civil society in Mexico during two decades of citizens' struggles to hold the state accountable, documenting both continuity and change in the periods before, during, and after Mexico's breakthrough democratic elections in 2000.</p><p>Fox investigates how much power-sharing really happens in policy innovations such as participatory social and environmental councils, citizen oversight of elections, local government social investment funds, participation reforms in World Bank projects, and community-managed food programs, as well as new social oversight and public information access reforms. He also documents the simultaneous exodus of millions of Mexicans to the US, where many have come together in a new migrant civil society. Fox concludes with a call for new analytical frameworks in which to understand "transitions to accountability" that would focus on the interaction between participation, transparency, and accountability. </p><p><i>Accountability Politics</i> is the latest book in the Oxford Studies in Democratization series, intended for scholars and students of comparative politics and related disciplines. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154ff528072704601a012ff4f742a58"><name>1911</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Angela Davis explores social problems of incarceration on UCTV</title><keywords>angela davis, uctv</keywords><start-date>1201676400000</start-date><display-name>Angela Davis explores social...</display-name><path>/2008/01/1911</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/01/1911</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338520853</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338520853</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>"The Prison: A Sign of Democracy?"-- a lecture by UCSC history of consciousness professor Angela Davis--will premiere on UCTV, February 4 at 9 a.m., and run throughout the week.

Doyle as the new Vice Chancellor for Information Technology (VCIT) at UC Santa Cruz. She replaces Vice Provost Larry Merkley, who is retiring after serving in the position since February 2003. We extend our thanks to the VCIT Search Committee who served the campus admirably.</p><p>We would like to express sincere gratitude for the dedicated and very successful work accomplished by Larry Merkley during his tenure. Vice Provost Merkley has guided the IT division through many challenges, including the extremely complex IT transformation project, and has done so with equanimity and professionalism, hallmarks of his administration. Vice Provost Merkley's last day at UCSC will be February 7.</p><p>We are delighted that Dr. Doyle will be joining the administration as our campus's new Vice Chancellor for IT. She has a remarkably wide range of experience and success with information technology, and will bring a tremendous breadth of knowledge and expertise to the campus. In addition, Mary Doyle is a second generation Santa Cruz native who is very excited to be "coming home."</p><p>Dr. Doyle is currently the Vice Provost for Planning, Budget, and Resource Management at Washington State University (WSU). Dr. Doyle has been at WSU since 1997, where she was first appointed as Director of Information Technology. She was then promoted to the positions of Vice President for Information Services and WSU's Chief Technology Officer, also holding the title of Vice Provost for Administration. At WSU, Dr. Doyle managed computer security, telecommunications, all levels of computing services and support, along with a statewide interactive video network for higher education, two PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) television stations, and 13 NPR (National Public Radio) radio stations. She was also the technology representative to WSU's Board of Regents, and created the IT Diversity Advisory Group.</p><p>Prior to her work at WSU, Dr. Doyle was at UC Santa Barbara from 1987 to 1997, leaving a post there as the Assistant Provost to the College of Letters and Sciences for WSU. She has also had experience at Arizona State University, the Chase Bank of Arizona, and other private companies and educational institutions. Dr. Doyle earned her Ph.D. in Educational Leadership and Organizations from UC Santa Barbara in 1998.</p><p>Among the many professional organizations and other groups she belongs to, Dr. Doyle is a member of the higher-education nonprofit organization EDUCAUSE, the Association for College and University Telecommunications Professionals, the Society for College and University Planning, and the Microsoft Higher Educational Advisory Group. She has also been a volunteer at the Pullman (Washington) Food Bank, served on both the UCSB Art Museum Council and the WSU Museum of Art Advisory Council, and participated for many years in Surfrider Foundation Beach Cleanup Days.</p><p>As VCIT at UCSC, Dr. Doyle will oversee Information Technology Services, which has an annual budget of $27.5 million and over 270 full-time employees. In this position, she will be responsible for planning and delivering educational technology to the campus-wide computing and communications system. Additionally, Dr. Doyle will create and administer IT policies, identify and recommend new technologies for adoption by UCSC, and be responsible for administering the budget necessary to achieve campus IT goals. The VCIT reports jointly to the Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor.</p><p>We are eager to begin working with Dr. Doyle and are confident that her skills and talents will be a successful match for the campus. Dr. Doyle begins her position here on February 4. Please join us in welcoming Dr. Doyle to our community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost and EVC David S.
