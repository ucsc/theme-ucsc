Although UCSC scientists have made important contributions in many areas of health-related research, and many are leaders in their fields, awareness of their work remains relatively low among people outside the sciences, even on campus.</p><p>"For an institution of our small size, our impact on biomedical research is truly remarkable," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p><p>UCSC researchers are working on cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and infectious diseases such as AIDS, cholera, and malaria. There are groups working on an artificial retina to restore sight to the blind, a glucose sensor for diabetics, and the toxic effects on humans and in the environment of heavy metals such as lead and manganese.</p><p>The campus has been especially effective at fostering creative, interdisciplinary approaches to fundamental human health problems. "Our secret advantage is the ability of our students and faculty to cross traditional departmental lines in order to tackle really tough problems," Thorsett said. "Bringing computer science and wet lab biology together to form a world-class group in bioinformatics and genomics is one good example of that."</p><p>The absence of a medical school at UCSC rules out clinical research involving patients. But clinical advances depend on discoveries in areas such as genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and toxicology. In these areas, UCSC has built strong programs and established an impressive record of accomplishments. </p><p>In a recent survey of published research in molecular biology and genetics, two UCSC scientists--bioinformatics pioneers David Haussler and James Kent--<a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1864">ranked among the top ten authors with the most high-impact papers in this area</a>. </p><p>Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer professor of molecular biology, has won nearly every major honor in his field, including election to the National Academy of Sciences, for discovering the structure of the cellular protein machine. <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=940">His findings are being used to develop new antibiotics to fight drug-resistant infections</a>.</p><p>Understanding the basic biological processes involved in human diseases is an essential step in developing new ways to prevent and treat them. Often, biologists can study these fundamental processes in the test tube or in simple organisms, such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Other studies require the use of animals more closely related to humans, such as mice and rats. Fruit flies don't have mammary glands, for example, so mice are often used for research on breast cancer.</p><p>The use of animals in research, at UCSC and elsewhere, is strictly regulated to ensure that the studies are justified and the animals are treated humanely. Every proposal is reviewed by an oversight committee, and research facilities undergo regular inspections.</p><p>Much of the funding for health-related research comes from the National Institutes of Health, which provides more than $10 million in grants to UCSC researchers every year. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), meanwhile, has provided more than $9 million to fund the campus's growing stem cell research program. UCSC's ability to attract this level of funding through peer-reviewed grant programs is a testament to the quality of its  health-sciences faculty and their ongoing research programs. </p><p>At the same time, the campus has created a comprehensive and innovative health-sciences major to prepare students for careers in medicine. Established in 2003 and administered by the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, the health-sciences program is the campus's fastest growing major and among its most popular. Designed with California's health care needs in mind, the program requires students to become proficient in Spanish and to do an internship in a community health care setting.</p><p>The Spanish-language component of the program teaches students both medical terminology and conversational skills, while the internship allows students to see the day-in, day-out practice of a working health professional. Health-care-professional schools are looking for people with just that kind of field experience, said Grant Hartzog, associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology and a member of the program's advisory committee. </p><p>"It's one way of measuring someone's commitment, and making sure people have a good understanding of what they're getting themselves into," Hartzog said.</p><p>The health sciences major complements the health-related research programs at UCSC. These successful programs benefit students, the state of California, and the world at large, Thorsett said. "Our faculty, researchers, and students are deeply engaged in research that will transform our understanding of health and disease, and our graduates are ready to help meet the increasingly complex technological, scientific, and social challenges that health care faces in California and the world."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91557ee98072704601a012ff73e0f82c"><name>1996</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus reacts to 'heinous' incident at professor's home</title><summary>As news swept through campus last week that six masked protesters had confronted a UCSC faculty member at her home, many expressed shock and dismay at the nature of the altercation.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><description>As news swept through campus last week that six masked protesters had confronted a UCSC faculty member at her home, many expressed shock and dismay at the nature of the altercation.</description><start-date>1204527600000</start-date><display-name>Campus reacts to 'heinous'...</display-name><path>/2008/03/1996</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/1996</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338553509</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338553509</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As news swept through campus last week that six masked protesters had confronted a UCSC faculty member at her home, many expressed shock and dismay at the nature of the altercation.</p><p>Many echoed the sentiments of Chancellor George Blumenthal, who expressed outrage and called the incident "the most serious attack on academic freedom" in the campus's history.</p><p> </p><p>"We cannot succumb to intimidation of the sort that was attempted this weekend," said Blumenthal, when he discussed the incident during his opening remarks at his winter-quarter brown-bag lunch meeting with staff. "This is unacceptable. We will not tolerate it." Blumenthal's remarks were met with sustained applause.</p><p>The confrontation was the latest in a spate of recent incidents, including four cases of residential vandalism and several intimidating telephone calls, that have targeted UCSC faculty, staff, and graduate students active in health-science research.</p><p>On Science Hill last week, several professors expressed frustration that their work is misunderstood, and others alluded to tensions among faculty over the ongoing tree sit. Among those who would work in the building planned for the site of that four-month-old protest, pockets of faculty support for that protest are viewed by some researchers as a profoundly discouraging assault on their fundamental ability to pursue research. </p><p>The sentiment that a home attack "crossed the line" was mentioned by several individuals. </p><p>"It's a heinous thing that happened," said Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and chair of the department. "There are all kinds of ways to protest, but when you have people being attacked in their homes, you've long since crossed the line. How is that defensible?"</p><p>Many appeared disheartened by what they saw as increasing polarization between people with opposing viewpoints. </p><p>"As someone in the sciences, it's really scary to hear that people are willing to confront science with violence," said one student, who was studying in the lobby area of the Physical and Biological Sciences building. "It also makes me wonder why people had to take it to that level," added the senior, who is majoring in environmental studies and plant science.</p><p>Literature professor Tyrus Miller, co-provost of Cowell College, called the attack "reprehensible" and urged faculty to show solidarity with colleagues who have been subject to intimidation "whether it is a professor dealing with controversial political topics in his or her classroom, or the conduct of legitimate scientific research."</p><p>Another undergraduate who is majoring in mathematics and physics, called the protesters tactics "unacceptable." </p><p>"It's the same scare tactics extremists are using in other countries to support their ideas," said the student, who has been monitoring reactions to the confrontation on the web. "It's unacceptable under any circumstances to use those tactics."</p><p>One faculty member, who declined to give his name, said tersely, "It's a criminal act. It's terrorism." </p><p>"Maybe they don't understand the kind of work we do," he wondered aloud, prompting a colleague to interject. "It's coming from not knowing the science and what's being done," she said. </p><p>Psychology professor Alan Kawamoto expressed disbelief at the personal nature of the confrontation. "There have been animal-rights protests on campus before, but by going to someone's personal residence, it becomes a personal invasion and not a protest against certain kinds of activities." </p><p>Referring to earlier incidents in which protesters have targeted UCSC researchers, some scientists expressed frustration and fatigue. </p><p>"We're annoyed and somewhat angered," said Alan Zahler, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology. "The research done here is of fundamental importance, and we are widely recognized for that. It's hard to grasp because it makes no rational sense to us."</p><p>Zahler's department is actively looking for colleagues who do vertebrate developmental biology and vertebrate stem cell research because "those are the questions that need to be asked," he said, emphasizing that researchers are not testing products on animals.</p><p>Nevertheless, Zahler expressed doubt that greater awareness about the types of research being conducted at UCSC would discourage protesters.</p><p>"I don't know what drives people who work in underground movements and wear masks on their faces," he said wearily. "Nobody would have any problem discussing their research--especially if those discussions took place at work. In fact, it would be hard to stop most of us from talking about our research once we got started. The research defines our careers. But to bring this argument to their home and frighten their children? Then it's not a discussion. It violates everything the university stands for."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915580478072704601a012ff1f970f66"><name>1997</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Breast-cancer researcher undeterred by protests</title><summary>The UCSC scientist targeted at her home by protesters is undeterred by the violent nature of the confrontation and says cancer remains her primary foe.&#13;

"That was back when they didn't manage cancer well, and they certainly didn't manage the pain well, and I just remember how horrifying it was to see someone die like that."</p><p>Cancer has struck her immediate family twice since then: Both of her sisters have been diagnosed, one with cervical cancer at the age of 20, and the other with colon cancer.</p><p>"That's why I think what I do is so important," she said. "Cancer touches all of us. I'm very clear that being a biomedical researcher is who I am. I couldn't do anything else."</p><p>Her interest in science began as an undergraduate at a small, liberal arts residential college within a large public university.</p><p>"I wasn't a kid with a chemistry set," she said. "I come from a liberal arts family. I had no models for becoming a scientist. I went to college thinking I'd be a writer. I was an English major."</p><p>Then she got a work-study job in a water-quality lab and thought she would become an environmental scientist--until she heard a talk on cancer research. "I became fascinated with how genes are regulated and, more importantly, how they are de-regulated during cancer," she recalled. "As I got deeper into the field, I realized I could satisfy my curiosity  and help people like my sisters and grandmother."</p><p>It was as a postdoctoral researcher that she conducted ground breaking work on the molecular cues that direct the development of the nervous system, which paved the way for her current work trying to understand how these same cues operate during breast cancer development. This research promises to identify novel therapeutic targets and generate new treatment strategies. </p><p>She joined the UCSC faculty in part because of the campus's residential colleges, a grading system that includes narrative evaluations, and the opportunities undergraduates here have to participate in scientific research.</p><p>"I wanted to teach and have a lab that incorporates students in research, because personally I found it difficult to have this opportunity as an undergraduate," she said. "For me, coming to Santa Cruz was a choice. I received an offer from a medical school, but I wanted to be here because I felt the supportive environment at UCSC would allow me to successfully balance having a family, being a teacher, and doing research."</p><p>Today, seven undergraduates are a central part of the team of researchers in her lab, which costs about $250,000 a year to operate. Undergraduates perform a lot of the work, and she called them a "fabulous group." </p><p>"They are willing to invest time and effort to participate in the research, and in return they learn about the magic of scientific exploration. Together, we discover what nobody knows," she said, her voice rising in awe.</p><p>In fact, she thought she would have to close her lab until she qualified a few weeks ago for a major grant from the National Institutes of Health for her breast cancer research. "It's been a hard eight years with the Bush administration," she said. "Science funding is at an all-time low. It seems that the government chooses to wage two wars rather than invest in science in America."</p><p>News of the grant was an enormous relief. "I feel like I have a new lease on my scientific career," she said. But about three weeks ago, protesters chalked intimidating graffiti on her front walkway. And on February 24, a group of black-clad, hooded intruders with bandanas covering their faces stormed the front of her home. "They terrified my children and me," she said. "My husband was able to drive them away and a neighbor called the police. "</p><p>"We have a lot of political discussions in our house," said the researcher, whose daughter and son are under the age of 10. "We have talked a lot about the first amendment recently and how it is okay to speak up for what you believe in, but it is not okay for intruders to come onto our property." </p><p>"My daughter is really proud of me," the researcher said of her oldest child. "She knows the research I do is important and may contribute to a cure for breast cancer."</p><p> </p><p>"Growing up, my sister had cervical cancer, and today there's an immunization for young women to protect them against this disease," she said. "Now that I am in my 40s, I see friends getting breast cancer. I hope research groups like mine can be as successful in developing a cure for this disease as other research teams have been for cervical cancer. I believe saving human lives is important enough to justify the use of animals for this type of research. But I recognize that there is significant debate on this issue." </p><p>The care of animals used in scientific research is strictly regulated. "There's excellent oversight of the work I do," she said. "I justify the use of every animal, and sure, that process is arduous, but it's a good thing. We sit down and carefully think through every experiment."</p><p>At the end of the day, she takes pride in her accomplishments.</p><p>"I am proud to be a scientist and a public servant," she said. "My husband and I believe in service to the community, and we live our beliefs."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915588d18072704601a012ff053e6d68"><name>2002</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Save the date: Chancellor to be inaugurated Friday, June 6</title><summary>The formal inauguration of George Blumenthal as UCSC's 10th chancellor will take place on Friday, June 6.</summary><keywords>George Blumenthal, inauguration, UCSC's 10th chancellor</keywords><description>The formal inauguration of George Blumenthal as UCSC's 10th chancellor will take place on Friday, June 6.</description><start-date>1205132400000</start-date><display-name>Save the date: Chancellor...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2002</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2002</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338556058</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338556058</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The formal inauguration of George Blumenthal as UCSC's 10th chancellor will take place on Friday, June 6.

With more than 200 scientific publications, 20 book chapters, and three books, he was a world authority on protein folding. Mistakes in this molecular process lead to degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease. Tony's research was to understand what goes wrong and to design treatments to repair the damage or prevent it from happening. He worked tirelessly towards the goal of designing potential drugs and therapeutic methods to combat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>
<p>Widely respected in the scientific community for his research accomplishments. Tony received many invitations to give talks on his research and was elected to the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in 2004. He won the BioSTAR Outreach Ambassador of the Year Award in 2002 and the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences' Outstanding Faculty Award in 2007.</p>
<p>Well respected by both graduate and undergraduate students for his teaching, approachability and command of the subjects, Tony mentored more than 60 graduate students, over 50 postdoctoral associates, and more than 150 undergraduates.</p>
<p>Tony provided extraordinary service to his department, the campus and his professional community. He served as a preceptor at Merrill College and as the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department Chair. His service included participation on numerous senate committees over the years and he was a regularly invited reviewer of journal articles, books and proposals as well as study sections and panels for NSF and NIH.</p>
<p>Tony was an avid bike rider as well as an accomplished fine-art photographer, exhibiting his work in Santa Cruz County's Open Studios.</p>
<p>Throughout Tony's career, he conducted groundbreaking research, provided outstanding teaching on all levels and contributed exemplary service to the biophysical chemistry communities as well as to our campus. We were fortunate to have had him as a colleague and friend.</p>
<p>We do not yet have any information regarding memorial services that may be planned.</p>
<p>Please join me in expressing our sincere condolences to Tony's wife, Shirley, his daughter Christa, other family members and his many colleagues and friends.</p>

Rice is one of four Santa Cruz County artists selected from a pool of 46 visual artists that will receive the grants to pursue their work.</p>
<p>The Rydell fellowships were established by long-time Santa Cruz cultural icons Roy and Frances Rydell and are administered by the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County. They are awarded solely on artistic merit by a panel of arts professionals from outside the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>A lifelong resident of the California coast, Rice came to Santa Cruz as a student at UCSC in 1974. Three years later, she established Moving Parts Press <a href="http://www.movingpartspress.com">web site</a> and began her career as a printer, teacher, literary/fine arts publisher, and book artist.</p>
<p>Work from Moving Parts Press has been included in exhibitions and collections both nationally and internationally--from book shows in New York and Frankfurt to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Moving Parts Press has also received numerous awards and grants from organizations that include the National Endowment for the Arts and the French Ministry of Culture.</p>

But some UCSC employees go to work in their pajamas. </p><p>They're telecommuters. For some staff members, a computer with a high-speed connection and the appropriate software, a phone, any relevant files or paperwork, and a formal telecommuting agreement are all that's needed to work from home. </p><p>Though the campus doesn't keep figures on how many of its employees take part in such alternative work arrangements, the topic is one the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab">Staff Advisory Board</a> wants to make more visible. </p><p>"Telecommuting is an important issue for staff, both in terms of retention--increasing productivity and making staff feel supported--and environmental issues--the amount of people and cars coming on campus," said Eric Grabiel, chair of the 12-member Staff Advisory Board.</p><p> </p><p>To that end, the SAB will host a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1994">panel discussion</a> for all staff on telecommuting and alternative work schedules from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 12, in Room 71 of Social Sciences 2.</p><p>The panel discussion will cover UCSC policy and guide participants to the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr-procedures/section-e/e13.pdf">currently available resources</a>, the benefits of telecommuting and alternative schedules, and best practices and strategies for working with your supervisor to propose and develop an alternative work schedule or plan. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation.</p><p> </p><p>Assistant Chancellor Ashish Sahni, who telecommutes on Wednesdays, will participate as a panelist via conference call. </p><p>Chancellor George Blumenthal supports telecommuting as long as it makes sense for the job and is equally beneficial to the employee, the manager, and the unit, with clear expectations on all sides. </p><p>"In fact, a member of my immediate office telecommutes one day a week, and we regularly evaluate the success of that arrangement," said Blumenthal. "It's important that we do all that we can to make UCSC even more of a family-friendly campus."</p><p>Retention and productivity are two of the most important reasons to increase awareness of a telecommuting option, said Grabiel. </p><p>"Work/life balance for staff is an issue," said Grabiel.  "I would like to see recommendations to the administration that build greater incentives, support, encouragement, technical advisement, and responsibility on the part of managers and supervisors to increase the usage and development of telecommuting."</p><p>Telecommuting and alternative work schedules are commplace among faculty at UCSC, said Grabiel. </p><p>The advisory board sees the issue as one of staff welfare and "would like to see more formal campus support, encouragement, and recognition to units and supervisors who promote and support telecommuting," Grabiel said.</p><p> </p><p>One of the first things to consider when considering a telecommuting arrangement is whether a particular job allows for it, said Cathy Schoenfeld, manager of policy and personnel systems with Staff Human Resources. </p><p>And, she said, "if you're going to be working from home, do you have the computer setup, connectivity, phone, total availability? Because it should be exactly as it is at work, and you need to have the ability to follow through on your assignments." </p><p>Work calls can be forwarded to a designated number, said Grabiel.</p><p>"So a telecommuter can seamlessly never miss a call, and it's invisible to the person making the call," he said.</p><p>Though there is currently no formal campus initiative to increase or develop telecommuting, the practice is supported by Staff HR for work/life balance reasons, said Schoenfeld, who, herself, telecommutes one day a week. A UCSC employee since 1985, she's been on her once-a-week telecommuting arrangement for about a year.  </p><p>"It helps productivity, retention, and recruitment, and quite frankly, you're able to get projects done," she said. </p><p>She's noticed that telecommuting one day a week increases her work output because it eliminates the commute and allows her the quiet time she needs to concentrate. </p><p>UC is not mandated to provide equipment for telecommuting, said Schoenfeld, but decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to Wednesday's workshop, the Staff Advisory Board also hopes to conduct a survey among staff this spring that will ask questions and gather input on telecommuting.</p><p>For more information, contact the Staff Advisory Board at <a href="mailto:staffadv@ucsc.edu">staffadv@ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915596f68072704601a012ffa112ca26"><name>2011</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Memorial to honor Tony Fink, April 13</title><start-date>1204786800000</start-date><display-name>Memorial to honor Tony...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2011</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2011</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338559678</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338559678</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Many of you may know that Tony Fink, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry on our campus, died on Sunday following a yearlong illness.

<p>The closest stars to our Sun are in the three-star system called Alpha Centauri, a popular destination for interstellar travel in works of science fiction. UCSC graduate student Javiera Guedes used computer simulations of planet formation to show that terrestrial planets are likely to have formed around the star Alpha Centauri B and to be orbiting in the "habitable zone" where liquid water can exist on the planet's surface. The researchers then showed that such planets could be observed using a dedicated telescope.</p>
<p>"If they exist, we can observe them," said Guedes, who is the first author of a paper describing the new findings. The paper has been accepted for publication by the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>
<p>Coauthor Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, said a number of factors converge to make Alpha Centauri B an excellent candidate for finding terrestrial planets. The Doppler detection method, which has revealed the majority of the 228 known extrasolar planets, measures shifts in the light from a star to detect the tiny wobble induced by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. Factors that favor the use of this technique for Alpha Centauri B include the brightness of the star and its position in the sky, which gives it a long period of observability each year from the Southern Hemisphere, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Detecting small, rocky planets the size of Earth is challenging, however, because they induce a relatively small wobble in their host stars. According to Laughlin, five years of observations using a dedicated telescope would be needed to detect an Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri B.</p>
<p>Coauthor Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University is leading an observational program to intensively monitor Alpha Centauri using the 1.5-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The researchers hope to detect real planets similar to the ones that emerged in the computer simulations.</p>
<p>"I think the planets are there, and it's worth a try to have a look," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>To study planet formation around Alpha Centauri B, the team ran repeated computer simulations, evolving the system for the equivalent of 200 million years each time. Because of variations in the initial conditions, each simulation led to the formation of a different planetary system. In every case, however, a system of multiple planets evolved with at least one planet about the size of Earth. In many cases, the simulated planets had orbits lying within the habitable zone of the star.</p>
<p>In addition to Guedes, Laughlin, and Fischer, the authors of the paper include UCSC postdoctoral researcher Eugenio Rivera and graduate student Erica Davis, and Elisa Quintana of the SETI Institute. This research was supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>

How should we respond when people are being uncivil?" Martin Shaw asked senate members during her presentation of the resolution. </p><p>Shaw offered the resolution because she felt that the use of pepper spray and batons by police on November 7--the first day of a four-month tree-sit--did not follow campus policies developed in the wake of 2005's "Tent University" controversy. </p><p>Shaw was chair of the Tent University and Restructuring Emergency Response Procedures Task Force, formed after the Tent University demonstration to provide guidance for similar protests in the future.</p><p>But in light of the ongoing tree-sit protest on Science Hill and the recent attack at the home of a UCSC researcher, many faculty, including a large number of scientists, were strongly opposed to the resolution. </p><p>Science faculty said the tree-sit--which began in the pre-dawn hours of November 7 and which later that day involved protesters opposed to the campus's Long-Range Development Plan--has left the Physical Sciences Building in lockdown. Faculty speaking at the meeting said the ongoing protest, in which demonstrators have committed acts of vandalism, including spreading human waste in science building bathrooms and setting off false fire alarms, has endangered faculty, staff, and students--and restricted student access to faculty.</p><p>"The tree-sitters and their supporters claim freedom of speech and freedom of expression," said Olof Einarsdottir, professor and chair of chemistry. "But their acts have denied the rights of serious students who want to attend classes and meet with faculty." </p><p>The problem is not the police response, added Martin Chemers, social psychologist and former acting chancellor. It's an increase in the level of violence on campus during the past few years.</p><p>"This is not your grandfather's demonstration," Chemers said. "This is a new, different kind of demonstration, and I don't think we should be imagining these to be just innocent college students trying to have a say in our deliberations." </p><p>Because of the recent escalation of violence related to protests, EVC Kliger announced his intention to establish a campuswide program in which differences can be discussed and resolutions reached.</p><p>"The goal of the program will be to model proactive conflict resolution strategies and expand alternative dispute resolution options for the UCSC community--administrators, faculty, staff, and students," Kliger said.</p><p>Many faculty were in favor of Martin Shaw's proposal, saying a framework for peaceful resolution and faculty involvement in demonstrations needs to be in place. </p><p>"I support this resolution wholeheartedly," said Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies. "I'm an unqualified supporter of the philosophical principles of nonviolence, and I believe that this resolution falls within those principles." </p><p>Anthropology professor Shelly Errington also offered support for the resolution but expressed surprise and regret over the impact recent actions have had on her science colleagues. "I have been swept away with the things our colleagues on Science Hill have been saying about what they've been suffering," said Errington. "This is really, really appalling."</p><p>She added, however, "the point is we do not have an effective way to bring together our campus to deal with this kind of demonstration . and this resolution is to try to get a dialogue going." </p><p>When Allen Van Gelder, professor of computer science, made a motion to send the resolution to the Senate's Committee on Faculty Welfare, participants agreed by a hand vote of 31 to 19. </p><p>Immediately following the vote, Joel Yellin, professor of environmental science and law, offered a resolution commending the chancellor and executive vice chancellor for their efforts to ensure the safety of the campus community. The resolution was approved by a vote of 23 to 16. </p><p>Asked about the fate of her resolution after the meeting, Martin Shaw said she thought it would not be seen again. "I think it will die in committee," she said. </p><p>Martin Shaw said her resolution was not about issues prompting the recent demonstrations--the LRDP, for example--but about how those incidents are handled. She had hoped to separate the two. "It didn't work. It was the wrong moment," she said.</p><p>No immediate changes regarding police response to demonstrations are planned, Chancellor George Blumenthal said after the meeting. But, he added, the meeting had underscored much common ground.</p><p>"We share the values of students to demonstrate peacefully," Blumenthal said. ""We will be working with Senate leadership to find the best way forward." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155a0c48072704601a012ffca7997e5"><name>2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sign up for fresh, organic produce from the UCSC Farm&#13;

<p>Ray took pride in his work as the property manager in Materiel Management, now known as University Business Services, where he had oversight for receiving, surplus operations, and equipment management.</p>
<p>Ray's colleagues remember him as the most ethical person they ever worked with, according to Lisa Rose, director of University Business Services. He treated his operation as if it were his own business.</p>
<p>After his retirement from the university, Ray volunteered thousands of hours with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's San Lorenzo Valley Office, receiving multiple awards for his contributions. Giving of himself to help others was an integral part of Ray's values, said Rose.</p>

According to Harder, eradication of the introduced pest may not be possible and is probably unnecessary.</p>
<p>Native to Australia, LBAM feeds on a wide range of plants and was first detected in California in 2006. When the moth was discovered on the Central Coast in 2007, Harder was concerned about its potential effects on the Arboretum's plant collections. The UCSC Arboretum maintains an extensive assemblage of plants from Australia and New Zealand, as well as other southern hemisphere plants and California natives.</p>
<p>In January, Harder and Jeff Rosendale, a Watsonville nursery owner, traveled to New Zealand, where LBAM was introduced more than 100 years ago, for a three-week fact-finding study. They found that it is considered a minor pest there and does not cause economically significant crop damage or harm native plants.</p>
<p>"It's not that bad a pest in New Zealand," Harder said. "It is effectively controlled almost exclusively by natural predators in both agricultural settings and wild lands."</p>
<p>A <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/pdf/HarderNZReportFINAL.pdf">report</a> by Harder and Rosendale was posted last week on the web site of State Assemblymember John Laird, one of several Bay Area legislators who have introduced bills to address the LBAM eradication effort.</p>
<p>Harder's findings were the subject of news stories in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle, Santa Cruz Sentinel, San Jose Mercury News, Monterey Herald</em>, and <em>Salinas Californian</em>. He also fielded calls from Bay Area radio stations KCBS, KRCB, KSCO, and KUSP.</p>

The results have significant implications for the study of the diet of early human ancestors, because anthropologists have long noted similarities between the teeth of hominids and orangutans, which appear to have independently evolved thickly enameled teeth that are well-adapted to the consumption of hard or gritty foods. </p><p>The new study, which correlates differences in the teeth of chimpanzees and orangutans with differences in their diets, appears in the current online issue of the Journal of Human Evolution in a paper entitled, "Functional Ecology and Evolution of Hominoid Molar Enamel Thickness: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii." </p><p> </p><p>"Orangutans have really thick enamel on their teeth and ridges across the basin of their molars, compared to chimpanzees, which have much thinner enamel," said Erin Vogel, associate researcher and lecturer in anthropology at UCSC. "Researchers have speculated for years about the function of this divergent morphology, but no one has ever measured the mechanical properties of their foods in the wild."</p><p>In the field, Vogel and coauthor Nathaniel J. Dominy, assistant professor of anthropology at UCSC, systematically tested the foods eaten by orangutans and chimpanzees for hardness and toughness, uncovering differences that correlate with morphological differences in the two species' teeth. The study features data gathered by Vogel during nearly a year she spent observing 21 orangutans in Borneo, and chimpanzee data gathered in Uganda by Dominy. Vogel and Dominy used a new standardized engineering technology to study the properties of foods, generating data that are truly comparable across different continents, a significant advance over previous studies of monkey foods.</p><p>Although orangutans and chimpanzees both prefer to eat ripe fruit, they turn to other sources of sustenance when fruit is unavailable. Those foods--called "fallback foods"--vary considerably and in ways that could explain why their teeth evolved so differently, said Vogel.</p><p>"When fruit is scarce, orangutans feed on foods that are harder and tougher than what chimps eat, including tree bark and really hard seeds that would probably crack the tooth of any other primate," said Vogel. "By contrast, chimpanzees rely primarily on leaves during fallback periods, so they need those sharp blades formed by thin enamel to fracture the leaves."</p><p>The findings indicate that fallback foods may have exerted selective pressure on tooth evolution, particularly on molar enamel. "For orangutans, those thick, ridged surfaces are a functional adaptation to the routine consumption of relatively tough and hard foods," said Vogel, noting also that fruit isn't consistently available in Southeast Asia, which prompts the apes to frequently supplement their diet with other foods.</p><p>The findings have implications for inferring the diet of early human ancestors, and they provide valuable comparative data for researchers exploring the diets of hominids. "We know early human ancestors had thicker enamel and very robust jaws, which this study indicates could have been adaptations to eating harder, gritty foods, including the underground storage organs of plants," said Vogel. Dominy has conducted pathbreaking resarch on the diet of early humans, which likely included bulbs, corms, and other underground plant parts.</p><p>The next phase of Vogel's research will be to analyze the teeth and diets of orangutans on the island of Sumatra, where the apes eat fewer seeds and bark than those on Borneo. "Orangutans in Borneo have more robust jaws than those on Sumatra, which would seem to correlate with differences in their diets," noted Vogel.</p><p>In addition to Vogel and Dominy, coauthors of the paper were Janneke T. van Woerden of the University of Utrecht; Peter W. Lucas of George Washington University; Sri S. Utami Atmoko of Universitas Nasional in Jakarta; and Carl P. van Schaik of the University of Zurich.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Editor's Note</b>: Vogel may be reached at (831) 459-1757 or evogel@ucsc.edu; Dominy may be reached at (831) 459-2541 or njdominy@ucsc.edu.</p><p>Contact the author at <a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155ad5f8072704601a012ffbe18b40d"><name>2025</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book spotlights the experiences of Mexicans in Chicago</title><summary>Chicago is home to one of the largest populations of Mexicans in the United States, and the experiences of Mexican immigrants in the Windy City offer a revealing lesson in how the forces of racism work, according to the author of the new book &lt;i&gt;Mexican C</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>arredondo, mexican, race, chicago, book</keywords><description>Chicago is home to one of the largest populations of Mexicans in the United States, and the experiences of Mexican immigrants in the Windy City offer a revealing lesson in how the forces of racism work, according to the author of the new book &lt;i&gt;Mexican C</description><start-date>1205737200000</start-date><display-name>New book spotlights the...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2025</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2025</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338565421</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338565421</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/03/images/arredondo.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/03/images/arredondo.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arredondo.250.jpg</name><file-size>110498</file-size><width>250</width><height>326</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gabriela Arredondo's new book examines the forces of racism.

"Industry lobbied for exemptions to legislative restrictions and began recruiting in Mexico and Texas, looking for workers--especially nonunion laborers--lured with promises of opportunity and paid transportation," she said.</p><p>Those efforts coincided with turmoil in Mexico during and after the revolution of 1910, setting the stage for what Arredondo calls a "distinctive moment" in the formation of Mexican identity in the United States. </p><p>"This was the first time significant numbers of Mexicans moved to the United States--it's a much older migration than most people realize," she said. "They entered a preexisting world of multiethnic groups, yet the experiences of Mexican immigrants in Chicago didn't follow the same trajectory of assimilation and adjustment as the European immigrants before them."</p><p>The Mexican Revolution provided intellectual, ideological, and practical tools that encouraged Mexicans to "self-define as a group" in Mexico, said Arredondo. "Upon leaving Mexico, most identified with their hometowns or home states, but when they got to Chicago, they began to identify as Mexican, even as they increasingly became targets of discrimination and objects of prejudice."</p><p>Armed with revolutionary pride in Mexico, they battled growing racism, deportation, and marginalization, according to Arredondo, adding, "Over the years, 'Mexican' began to carry derogatory connotations with powerful consequences." </p><p>By 1929, upward of 30,000 Mexicans in Chicago made up only one percent of the city's population, but in the workplaces and neighborhoods of Packingtown, the Near West Side, and South Chicago, Mexicans were a "very significant presence," said Arredondo, whose research uncovered evidence of conflict over women between immigrant groups. </p><p>"There weren't a lot of Mexican women, so Mexican men would date Polish women, or Irish women, and the men would have it out in the workplace," she said. "Most of the evidence and writing and oral histories that have survived are about men, so I also tried to find women, and their stories really shed light on what was going on."</p><p>That first wave of Mexican immigration also coincided with the Progressive Social Reform movement, one goal of which was to assimilate immigrants into U.S. society. Mexicans jockeyed for position in the city's ethnic and racial hierarchies but lost out to other immigrant groups, said Arredondo.</p><p>"During the inter-war period, that's when being Mexican in Chicago meant being a race," said Arredondo. "It wasn't just ethnic. It became racial. They were poor, minimally educated non-citizens with limited skills, people who remained foreign. It was very powerful, very much about exclusion, segregation, expulsion, and deportation." </p><p>As repatriation and deportation of Mexicans increased in the 1930s, the fear of being deported brought Mexicans together as a group and solidified their status as outsiders, said Arredondo. By 1939, discrimination against Mexicans was codified in work practices, housing, and a myriad of social situations in their everyday lives.</p><p>The economic strains of the Great Depression exacerbated existing tensions between Mexicans and other immigrants, asserted Arredondo. "But racism is not just economic," she said. "There's something else that goes on in the daily interactions people are having."</p><p>"The economy was booming in the 1920s, yet even then, conflicts between Mexicans and their immigrant neighbors were sharp," she said. "And prior to 1916, Chicagoans had had no exposure to sizable numbers of Mexicans. There was nothing that preordained them to being anti-Mexican. But discrimination starts and deepens."</p><p>Noting that the U.S. Border Patrol was established in 1924, Arredondo sees parallels between the early waves of Mexican immigration and current tensions over border security. "I'm the kind of historian who likes to go back to the past to understand the present," she said. "As happened in Chicago in the 1920s, if the meaning of Mexican becomes very derogatory to the police or politicians or nativist groups, for instance, it starts to get codified in behaviors and expectations, resulting in police brutality or racial profiling, and we see deportations of U.S. citizens, de-lousing stations at the border, and the kinds of groups we see monitoring the border today."</p><p>"This chapter of our history presents an interesting window into how race works," said Arredondo. "Race as a process operates in very subtle ways. It doesn't have to be a lynching or a cataclysmic event. It's created and given life in our everyday interactions with each other."</p><p>####</p><p>Contact the author at <a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155b0768072704601a012ffac92ea38"><name>2027</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Become a docent at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden</title><summary>Do you enjoy gardening, learning about food and farming issues, and sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge with others?

If the answer is "yes!," then consider becoming a tour guide at two of Santa Cruz's most beautiful locations. The UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden is looking for volunteer docents to help lead tours of the 25-acre organic farm and 3-acre Alan Chadwick Garden on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>A docent training will take place on six Monday afternoons from 3:30 pm to 6:30 p.m., beginning April 7 and ending May 12, at the UCSC Farm's Louise Cain Gatehouse. The first session will include a no-obligation orientation for those who want to know more about the opportunities available to docents.</p>
<p>Farm &amp; Garden docents help with a range of activities that include tours, public education events, work days, and other efforts that support the Farm &amp; Garden's community outreach work.</p>

Tau Beta Pi, founded in 1885, is the largest engineering honor association in the world, with nearly 500,000 members.</p>
<p>The ceremony included the induction into the assocation of 20 UCSC alumni and 13 current students. The chapter was also honored to include one faculty member--Patrick Mantey, Baskin professor of computer engineering--who had not been formally inducted although he helped set up a Tau Beta Pi chapter at the University of Notre Dame as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>Tau Beta Pi vice president Solange Dao and secretary-treasurer Jim Froula officiated at the installation of the UCSC chapter and initiation of new members. Members of many local chapters attended the ceremony and a subsequent banquet, including contingents from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, San Francisco State University, University of the Pacific, and the Bay Area Alumni Chapter.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, visitors toured the engineering school's Undergraduate Hardware Lab, a new facility sponsored by the honor society and the UCSC chapters of the Society of Women Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), with funding from a $90,000 grant from Agilent.</p>
<p>Tau Beta Pi recognizes students of distinguished scholarship and exemplary character, emphasizing integrity, excellence, and dedication to service. Only the top one-eighth of juniors and one-fifth of seniors may be considered for membership, and students must perform service projects prior to initiation.</p>
<p>"It is both a recognition and an obligation. The dedication to giving back to the school and to society continues throughout the lifetime of membership with Tau Beta Pi," said Richard Hughey, professor of computer engineering and a faculty adviser to the honor society.</p>
<p>Affiliation with Tau Beta Pi was a goal of UCSC's Engineering Honor Society since its formation in 2004. UCSC's petition for a campus chapter was approved last year (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1697">earlier story</a>).</p>
<p>"A lot of people worked very hard for this, and it is a big honor for all of us," said chapter president Erik Pasternak. "We will, of course, continue to hold tutorials, demos, and other events on campus to encourage engineering and help teach new students."</p>
<p>Although membership in the chapter was limited to computer-engineering and electrical-engineering majors during the petitioning process, bioengineering majors will be eligible at the next initiation, and the chapter may also petition the association's annual convention to include other majors, Hughey said.</p>
<p>Hughey credited the past and present officers of the society for providing exceptional leadership. In particular, he singled out Pasternak and past presidents Angela Schmid, Andrew Hill, Ian Dunbar-Hall, and John Burr.</p>
<p>"The society has been fortunate to have had exceptional officers and members," Hughey said.</p>

Such a robotic climber would be an essential component of a "space elevator," a concept for transporting material into space via a cable or tether extending from the surface of the Earth into space.</p>
<p>The competition, sponsored by the Aerospace Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers, was held at the 2008 Earth and Space Conference ("Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments"), March 3 to 5, in Long Beach. The UCSC students--Bill Hogan, Kevin Hichborn, Scott Therien, and Laurel DeMarco--claimed the Fluor Daniel "Perpetual trophy for collegiate competition in extraterrestrial robotics."</p>
<p>The four electrical engineering students built the climber as their capstone senior design project. Although it would not be suitable for a real space elevator, the overall concept is the same, they said.</p>
<p>"The concept of a solar-powered climbing machine that attaches to a tether and climbs up is the same as our project. But in a real space elevator, the tether would be different and the climber would have to carry a lot more weight," Hogan said.</p>
<p>The scale of an actual space elevator would be mind-boggling. For the tether to reach geosynchronous orbit, it would have to be 22,236 miles long, Hogan said. In Long Beach, the robotic climbers went up a 20-foot ribbon of two-inch webbing.</p>
<p>"The goal of the competition is to stimulate design ideas and get people thinking about how to tackle the problem," Therien said. "So the way we attached the climber to the tether and the mechanism for pulling itself up might be used in a real space elevator."</p>
<p>This was an especially challenging senior design project because of the wide range of problems that had to be solved, said John Vesecky, professor and chair of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering. Vesecky served as a faculty adviser to the team along with the other instructors for the senior design course--Pak Chan, associate professor of computer engineering, and Gabriel Elkaim, assistant professor of computer engineering. Lecturer Steve Petersen advised the group on the design of the power supply.</p>
<p>"We are proud as the dickens of these folks, first of all for taking on this challenging project, and then for doing all of the mechanical engineering that it required, as well as the electrical engineering and computer engineering," Vesecky said. "They worked very smoothly as a team."</p>
<p>The project actually grew out of the team's desire to do something involving solar power or renewable energy, Hogan said. Elkaim, a robotics expert, suggested the space elevator competition as an interesting application of solar technology, although it involves an artificial light source rather than the Sun to power the climber.</p>
<p>The students worked together on the overall design and problem-solving, while each focused on a different subsystem. For example, DeMarco did all the software programming, Therien and Hogan worked on the solar array, and Hichborn worked on the remote control system. They weren't sure their climber would work until about 10 days before the competition. But in the end it outperformed the other entries, especially in its ability to carry a payload.</p>
<p>"We stopped adding weight when we reached three pounds, which is the weight of the climber, because we were so far ahead of the others," Hogan said.</p>
<p>The UCSC team shared first place with another team that had almost the same overall score, although technically the other team's design did not meet the guidelines for the competition due to a misunderstanding. Their climber used solar power to charge a battery, but could not run directly off solar power.</p>
<p>"It wasn't their fault, so they were allowed to compete. I felt bad for them, because they had put a lot of work into it and had come all the way from Ohio," Hogan said. The UCSC team's overall score was just a fraction of a percentage point higher than the other team's, he said.</p>

The proposed policy is the result of a collaborative effort of the Joint Academic Senate/Administration Task Force (comprised of campus faculty representation and members from the Academic Senate, Office of the President and campus administrators) formed to review the merit process for Officers of the University.</p><p>The proposed policy is modeled on the performance review process currently in place for the Chancellors, Deans and other faculty members and represents the current best practices of performance management programs at many organizations, including performance review practices in place currently at a number of UC campuses. The proposed policy was developed to provide a systematic process for establishing goals and expectations, and reviewing the accomplishments, of Senior Management Group employees who are Officers of the University.</p><p>The proposed policy is applicable to Officers of the University as defined under Regents Standing Order 100.1.a, including: President of the University, Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, other Vice Presidents, Associate Vice Presidents, Assistant Vice Presidents, University Auditor, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Director and Deputy Director of the DOE Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Chief Executive Officers at the Medical Centers.</p><p>Deans are excluded from this policy at this time since they are subject to the regular academic review process. Principal Officers of The Regents and the other members of the Senior Management Group may be subject to a similar review process at a future date, pending consultation and approval by The Regents.</p><p>The new proposed policy is available at the following URL: <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/index.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/index.html</a></p><p>As this is a UC system-wide review, we are asking for your comments to the proposed revisions by April 4, 2008.</p><p>Please forward your comments to Terilynn Bench in the Academic Personnel Office, <a href="mailto:tbench@ucsc.edu">tbench@ucsc.edu</a>  or call 459-5380.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Willeen McQuitta, Director of Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155ba418072704601a012ffcc913912"><name>2033</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CruzPay Student Employee Rollout</title><start-date>1205737200000</start-date><display-name>CruzPay Student Employee Rollout...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2033</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2033</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338568713</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338568713</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are writing to provide you with additional information on the upcoming plans to bring student employees into the CruzPay electronic time reporting system.

<p>"The university can take pride in the many positive and proactive actions that it has already taken over the last few years to ensure the safety and security of the entire campus community," states the report, released March 12. "However, despite this proactive record of recent accomplishments ... it became clear to the Task Force during the course of its review that much can be done."</p>
<p>The 85-page report, prepared by a Campus Security Task Force commissioned last year by UC President Robert Dynes, examined UC's preparedness in security, emergency notification, student mental health services, and general emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>The Campus Security Task Force, made up of university security, student affairs, and emergency preparedness experts, will present the report during the Regents meetings in San Francisco this week.</p>
<p>Virtually all other colleges and universities around the country have been undertaking similar exercises since the tragedy at Virginia Tech, said Tom Vani, UCSC vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services and a member of the UC-wide task force. The Virginia Tech incident, in which a gunman last April killed 32 people and himself, became the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.</p>
<p>"The report concludes that, at this point in time, the university is adequately prepared to address a situation similar to that faced at Virginia Tech," Vani said. "But it also says that there are areas in which we need even more improvement--and it directs each campus to provide an assessment and plan to do this."</p>
<p>Since Virginia Tech, the nation has seen several more shootings. One of the most significant violent incidents happened in February at Northern Illinois University, where a man killed five students and himself in a shooting spree.</p>
<p>Though the report states UC has been preparing and training to respond to an "active shooter" incident since well before Virginia Tech, it includes a number of recommendations for continued progress in each area of study. It also says the 3 percent increase in UC's registration fee for 2007-08 will be dedicated specifically to enhancing mental health services, providing approximately $4 million.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing mental health challenges</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz received its share of the increased mental health funding this fall, reports Felicia McGinty, UCSC vice chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, students are coming to us with greater mental health support needs, so it's important that we be able to identify students with those needs and provide services to them or make the appropriate referrals," McGinty said.</p>
<p>Possible reasons for that increased need include higher stress levels among young adults who enroll in college today, said campus officials. Also, they said, advances in the medical treatment of mental illness have made it possible for those who in the past wouldn't have been able to attend college or live independently to do so now.</p>
<p>"As the Virginia Tech and even more recent Northern Illinois University tragedies remind us, campus security and mental health remain pressing issues for university campuses," said President Dynes. "Ensuring the safety and well-being of our students is one of the University of California's highest priorities, and we must constantly strive to improve our efforts in these critical areas. The task force has given us an important road map to do that."</p>
<p><strong>Steps UCSC has taken</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 19,000 people are on the UCSC campus on any given day during the school year, estimated Chris Gaylord, UCSC's new emergency planner and fire captain. The nighttime population is about 7,000.</p>
<p>With this population in mind, UC Santa Cruz has moved forward to implement a number of security, mental health, and emergency response measures, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initiating recruitment of a case manager and additional mental health professionals in an effort to improve the ratio of therapists to students. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Decreasing the wait time for counseling appointments and extending full mental health services throughout the summer. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Improving crisis communication through the planning and implementation of a system capable of distributing mass emails, phone messages, and text messages to cell phones. (ITS and campus emergency personnel have selected the W.A.R.N. system for this purpose and are now in negotiations with the vendor regarding the scope of the contract, aiming to have the contract finalized before the one-year anniversary of Virginia Tech. The service will be phased in beginning a few months after finalizing the contract.) <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Conducting training for key officials who would gather at the campus's emergency response center, a place dedicated for sharing information, communicating with the campus and broader community, and managing an unfolding crisis. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Expanding police personnel available for an emergency. (The department has hired an additional captain and will be hiring two sergeants and three more officers. The force, now numbering 21, will be brought to 26.)<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Funding and filling an emergency planner position.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Developing a campus safety and security <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/">web site</a> in order to provide one visible place for emergency resources and news.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Designing a <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/poster.html">poster</a> describing what to do in an emergency or crisis and distributing to members of the campus community.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Planning additional outreach to alert students, staff, and faculty of the resources available to them and the need to be prepared.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Systemwide initiatives include:</p>

<ul>
<li>UC campus police engaging in active shooter scenario training.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Establishing direct radio communications with local public safety agencies.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Expanded emergency mass notification systems at all campuses.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>UC campuses have also developed workplace violence training and education for faculty, staff, and students. In addition, many UC campuses have implemented a number of physical security measures and safeguards, including panic or alarm systems, and emergency call boxes.</p>
<p>"Universities around the nation have always done this kind of planning and preparedness work, but the recent tragic events have underscored the critical need for preparedness and vigilance," said Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for the Colleges and University Housing Services at UCSC.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities have "certainly seen an increase in shootings and violent crime," Scott said. "So now it's even more important to be prepared and have a variety of protocols to deal with these types of situations."</p>

And loving it.</p><p>For 18 undergraduates who just completed a new anthropology class that included four weeks of sweaty, gritty field research in Costa Rica, the discomforts of the jungle were a small price to pay for the opportunity to wake to the sounds of howler monkeys, work side-by-side with leading primatologists, and put years of classroom learning to the test. </p><p>"It seems like a cliché, but it was definitely a life-changing experience," said anthropology major Sarah Dyer. "College has made me a thinker, and this class taught me how to apply my thinking. That's priceless."</p><p>Dyer and 17 others enrolled in <i>Field Methods in Primatology</i>, a 15-unit "super course" with assistant professor Nathaniel J. Dominy. The first four weeks featured intensive study of UCSC's forest ecology as a warm-up for the immersion experience in Costa Rica, where each student undertook an original research project that culminated in a 35- to 50-page paper and an oral presentation during a symposium modeled after a professional academic conference.</p><p>Students undertook research projects that included exploring the links between locomotion and joint stress, facial gestures and communication, and social hierarchy and levels of stress hormones.</p><p>Andrew Cunningham, a senior majoring in anthropology, delayed graduation to take the course and said the experience shifted his post-college plans.</p><p>"It really inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. It's amazing to collect data that's yours and yours alone," said Cunningham, who analyzed the saliva of howler monkeys for the presence of a digestive enzyme that promises to shed light on the relationship among different primates. "It's hard but also awesome to have this class be the end of my undergraduate experience. I think something like this should be required."</p><p>Cunningham had assisted in the labs of several anthropology professors before taking this class. "As undergraduates, you interact with grad students and professors to some extent, but working on your own research and helping them do theirs--it wasn't just us being students. It was us feeling like researchers," he said. "I just want to be able to do the research, to study primates and answer some of these questions about humans and our relatives." </p><p>For his part, Dominy is committed to giving undergraduates access to extraordinary research opportunities, even in this era of dwindling resources and liability concerns. He and anthropology graduate students Brooke Crowley and Marissa Ramsier accompanied the undergraduates.</p><p>"You've just had a minicourse in how to be a researcher," Dominy told his students during a debriefing two days after they returned from Costa Rica. "Everything you've done is exactly what researchers do. Those data are hard-fought, hard-won data. No one else got it. That's an achievement. That's part of the hook, part of why researchers do it."</p><p>Students felt tested by the academic rigor of the class and challenged on a personal level by the hardships and discomforts of international travel, ranging from rustic accommodations and voracious mosquitoes to Internet withdrawal. Despite the challenges, including the $1,500 cost of the trip, all said they would do it again--in a heartbeat. </p><p>Jacob Hall, a senior majoring in neuroscience and behavior, called the class "the capstone" of his college years. "It's the best thing I've done as an undergraduate, by far," said Hall. </p><p>Inspired by the work of renowned biologist Robert Sapolsky, who studies stress in baboons, Hall measured the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the feces of howler monkeys. Fascinated by monkeys since he was a child, Hall said he is now rethinking his plans for medical school. "Primate behavior has opened up a whole new field. I have a lot to think about."</p><p>Like his classmates, he spoke highly of his professor.</p><p>"Coming into this, I didn't know quite how big Nate was, but as the trip went on, we'd hear about him being interviewed by NPR and ABC News. For a 22-year-old, that's huge," said Hall. "But he comes off as one of us. He got hurt like us, he got sick like us. He'd joke around with us. And then, when you needed him to be the genius he is, he could answer all your questions. He bridges the gap between the professor's world and undergraduates." </p><p>Reflecting on the entire experience, Hall said he felt enriched by more than the research opportunity. "You can take pictures but people don't understand the humidity, the smells, the sounds," said Hall, who recalled waking up at 5 a.m. to the sounds of howler monkeys surrounding his cabin "all howling at same time." Another time, he was certain he heard the growl of a jaguar.</p><p>"People talk about coming home and experiencing sensory overload, but for me, it's the opposite," said Hall. "In Costa Rica, I had so many new experiences every day, and coming back here, it feels slow. It's all so familiar. It's the same thing every day. I feel such a drive to go back now. I look around and wonder, where are the jungle animals?" </p><p>Anthropology major Dyer said she wanted to take the class so badly that she tried hard to stand out in Dominy's fall-quarter <i>Primate Behavior</i> class. "I have always wanted to do field work," said Dyer, who observed the locomotion of spider monkeys and howler monkeys to study the relationship of their prehensile tails to the shoulder joint. Hypothesizing that the tail relieves some of the stress placed on the joint as animals swing from tree to tree, Dyer hopes her investigation will add to the understanding of muscle function that could one day aid in the prevention of osteoarthritis. "It's about building on what other people have started," she said.</p><p>In a theme echoed by others, Dyer expressed deep gratitude for the class and for her classmates. "We all helped each other when we got stuck or frustrated," she recalled. "We got to know each other on a personal level. We were so lucky." </p><p>Reflecting on the class, Dominy reiterated his assertion that even a few days in the field are more valuable than many weeks in the classroom, and he expressed satisfaction with the impact the trip had had on his students.</p><p>"We want to provide an education that's memorable and fulfilling," he said. "Part of our responsibility as an undergraduate institution is to help launch students on the next phase of their lives."</p><p></p><p>Contact the author at <a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155c40f8072704601a012ffed9d57a5"><name>2039</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Blood and Oil: New environmental studies class proves popular with students</title><summary>In only two years, the new class &lt;i&gt;Blood and Oil: Energy, the Middle East, and War&lt;/i&gt; has become legendary on campus.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Blood and Oil, Alan Richards</keywords><description>In only two years, the new class &lt;i&gt;Blood and Oil: Energy, the Middle East, and War&lt;/i&gt; has become legendary on campus.</description><start-date>1206514800000</start-date><display-name>Blood and Oil: New...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2039</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2039</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338571220</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338571220</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/03/images/richards.alan.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/03/images/richards.alan.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>richards.alan.300.jpg</name><file-size>44447</file-size><width>300</width><height>223</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Students are captivated by Alan Richards's lectures about the Middle East.

"There's so much history, and it's really complicated, but knowing the history makes it a lot easier to comprehend what's going on today with the war, the international oil business, our foreign policy. There are so many different forces acting in the Middle East."</p><p>Richards sets an ambitious agenda. His goals are twofold: to equip students with a historically based "multi-layered" understanding of the Middle East that will help them understand current events, and to help them develop an analytical approach to investigating other conflicts around the world.</p><p>"It requires a lot of work, and it requires that we think outside the box. We will bring the tools of economics, politics, psychology, and sociology to bear," Richards told the class on the first day. "This is a serious topic. People die every day. I assume you'll work."</p><p>An interdisciplinary scholar known for his powerful delivery, Richards proceeded to quote Samuel Beckett, Albert Einstein, William Faulkner, Harry Truman, Aristotle, Voltaire, Hobbes, and Machiavelli during that first lecture. Then he posed a question guaranteed to fill the room again two days later: "What are we doing in the Middle East? I would argue that very little of what's happening is necessary for U.S. national interests."</p><p>Skyler Hackley, a senior majoring in environmental studies and philosophy, called Richards a "commanding" lecturer and one of the best instructors he's had at UCSC. "He prepares every lecture, and it's an incredible experience just to listen to him talk," said Hackley. "He's so well-informed. He cuts away any misconceptions."</p><p>Richards paces back and forth as he lectures, underscoring key points on the blackboard until his hands are yellow with chalk dust. He often sums up complex material with dry understatements, such as "This subject is deeply weird." </p><p>Such moments of levity are infrequent but welcome as Richards undertakes the Herculean task of presenting 20 lectures, each of which could be the focus of a 10-week class. He draws connections between today's tensions and the stresses that raged through Europe and the United States during their own periods of rapid industrialization and social transformation during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. "The Middle East and North Africa are undergoing their own great transformations now," said Richards. "They are undergoing economic changes, social changes, and demographic changes." </p><p>Two-thirds of the population of the Middle East is under the age of 30, more people are educated than ever before, and huge numbers have moved to the cities in search of opportunities. Yet the rising aspirations of youth are being met by soaring rates of unemployment, government ineptitude and corruption, and an international political and military crisis. "As always, it is a confluence of forces that's creating the profound dissatisfaction we see today," said Richards.</p><p>Historically, "great transformations" have always been accompanied by dramatic revolutions in energy use, and Richards challenges students to see how historical patterns of energy consumption--first of wood, then coal, and now oil--drive political alliances and provoke violent confrontations. "Middle East violence is not exceptional," he said. "It is to be expected."</p><p>Richards is perhaps an unlikely source of such eye-opening revelations, given that he grew up in Texas, the son of a petrogeologist who taught at Southern Methodist University. But he was never drawn to the oil business. Instead, he studied Arabic and Middle East Studies at Harvard and earned a Ph.D. in economic history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He spent two years in Cairo, where he was director of the UC Education Abroad Program and worked as a consultant to the World Bank and the United Nations, and then did contract work out of Washington, D.C., with the Agency for International Development before joining the UCSC faculty in 1976. His expertise has been sought by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and by military strategists at the U.S. Central Command in Florida, who invited him to brief top Pentagon officials in 2004 about the war in Iraq, and his textbook, <i>A Political Economy of the Middle East,</i> is a classic. </p><p>"He knows so much," said Gilmore. "Some classes are difficult to sit through, but in his, it's 'Tell me more.'"</p><p>Richards says he likes to teach classes "about things that matter," and he feels he is making a difference.</p><p>"Americans understand fundamentally nothing about the Middle East," he said, faulting the U.S. educational system, the mainstream media's superficial coverage of the region, and an insular national mindset. "It's very gratifying to be told by students things like, 'Wow, I never had any idea about any of this,' and 'Things look really different to me now.'" </p><p>For him, the threat of climate change has only increased the urgency of his message. "If we don't break our dependence on fossil fuels, which is oil and also coal--coal is even worse--as a species, we are cooked, quite literally," he said. </p><p>Leadership will be key to the ability of the United States to break its oil habit, according to Richards, whose students learned about the 20-percent drop in U.S. oil consumption that took place in the 1970s during Jimmy Carter's administration. "There are straightforward things we could do that could dramatically change our patterns of energy use," he said. </p><p>That message is welcome news to Erin Middleton, a senior majoring in environmental studies and mathematics who is taking a course from Richards every quarter this year "because he's that cool." </p><p>"I think it's phenomenal, the way this class has broadened my mind," she said. "I'm finally understanding some links." Although a more interactive class might appeal to some students, Middleton said she never tires of Richards's lectures. "There's so much I want to hear him say. And he does such a good job of showing that we know a lot about this and that change is possible."</p><p>Middleton is less optimistic about the war and the humanitarian aspects of the conflicts in the Middle East--and with good reason, according to Richards.</p><p>"Our presence in Iraq destabilizes the Middle East, although most Americans believe the opposite," he said. "So our first task is deconstructing these socially inherited ideas. And that's the good news. None of this is genetically programmed. It isn't in our bone marrow. We can decide to do things differently."</p><p></p><p>Contact the author at <a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155c5868072704601a012ff1239e86c"><name>2040</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recognize outstanding student employees with a SERAP award</title><start-date>1205996400000</start-date><display-name>Recognize outstanding student employees...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2040</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2040</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338571604</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338571604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Career Center is pleased to announce that campus supervisors will once again have an opportunity to publicly reward and recognize their outstanding student employees who continue to dedicate their abundant talent and skills to UCSC.</p>

He heads one of the largest university systems in the country with 15 campuses, 185,000 students and an annual operating budget of $10.7 billion.  Yudof previously was president of the University of Minnesota and a longtime faculty member, dean and provost at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>"After an intensive and thoughtful search, we have concluded that Mark Yudof is clearly the best candidate for the presidency of the world's leading public research university," said Blum.  "Chancellor Yudof is simply outstanding in the field.  He has demonstrated superb leadership at the helm of another distinguished multi-campus system, and his record of accomplishment in a lifetime of service to public higher education speaks for itself.  The members of the search committee are hopeful that the full Board of Regents will concur with our recommendation."</p><p>The new chief executive would replace President Robert C. Dynes, who last August announced his intention to step down no later than June 2008 after nearly five years in the position.</p><p>Yudof, 63, currently heads a public university system with nine academic campuses and six health institutions.  Before being named chancellor of the UT system he served five years as president of the University of Minnesota, where he achieved particular success in building both state funding and private support for the university.</p><p>"Chancellor Yudof brings strong leadership, a commitment to academic excellence and diversity, and a deep appreciation of shared governance," said Professor Michael Brown, chair of the UC Academic Senate.  "I believe the faculty will be pleased with his appointment."</p><p>A highly regarded legal scholar and the recipient of many professional awards, Yudof is an expert on constitutional law, freedom of expression and education law.  He has continued to teach throughout his administrative career.  His academic works include four editions of the book Educational Policy and the Law; one of the co-authors of the book is Professor David Kirp of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.</p><p>"Mark Yudof is an outstanding choice to lead the University of California - no one comes close," said Kirp, a leading expert on higher education leadership and author of the book Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education.  "At both Texas and Minnesota, he has demonstrated a unique combination of commitment to academic values, skill at managing and restructuring complex institutions, and effective engagement with public leaders.  These skills are critical to the success of chief executives in systems of public higher education today."</p><p>Before serving as chief executive at Texas and Minnesota, Yudof was a faculty member and administrator at UT Austin for 26 years.  He began his career there in 1971 as an assistant professor of law and later became dean of the School of Law from 1984 to 1994 and executive vice president and provost from 1994 to 1997, when he left for Minnesota.</p><p>Marye Anne Fox, chancellor of UC San Diego and a longtime colleague of Yudof's at UT Austin, called him a brilliant and highly original thinker with a demonstrated record of building excellence, a reputation for honesty, and a strong commitment to academic values.</p><p>"Mark is an eloquent spokesman for higher education, a mentor to students and faculty, and a parent who sympathizes with the need to minimize barriers to college entry for students," said Fox, who was a member of the chemistry faculty and vice president for research at UT Austin.  "He is a strong defender of academic freedom and shared governance with the faculty, and he places a high priority on building effective working relationships with state elected leaders.  His attention to the importance of diversity and to the value of building aggressive inter-institutional collaborations also makes him well-suited to addressing the needs of the UC system."</p><p>Yudof, a native of Philadelphia, earned a bachelor's degree and an LL.B. degree from the University of Pennsylvania.  He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Law Institute and a member of The President's Council on Service and Civic Participation, an appointment President George W. Bush made in 2006.</p><p>His wife, Judy, is the immediate past international president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and was the only woman president in the organization's 89-year history. She also serves on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Council in Washington, D.C., and on the international board of Hillel.</p><p>The University of California, recognized worldwide for its academic distinction, includes more than 220,000 students, 170,000 faculty and staff and an $18 billion annual budget at its 10 campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara.  The university offers programs in more than 150 disciplines, many of which are ranked among the top 10 nationally, and for the last 12 years has generated more patents than any other university in the nation. UC's five medical centers support the clinical teaching programs of the university's medical and health sciences schools and handle more than three million patient visits each year. The UC system also is involved in managing the U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories at Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos.</p><p>The presidential search committee consists of Blum; Regent Sherry L. Lansing, the vice chair; Regent Benjamin Allen, the 2007-08 student Regent; Regent Eleanor Brewer, representing the Alumni Associations of the University of California; and Regents Russell S. Gould, Eddie Island, Norman J. Pattiz, Leslie Tang Schilling and Paul Wachter.  Staff adviser Lynda Brewer and faculty representative Michael Brown also advised the committee. The search process has involved consulting with constituent groups from across all 10 campuses, including representative advisory committees of faculty, students, staff and alumni.</p><p>The University of California will have no further comment until the Board of Regents acts on the presidential appointment, Blum said.

The month-long series of concerts is also a showcase for new original works by UCSC faculty and graduate students, as well as a number of Bay Area composers. </p><p>"This a major collaborative event presented by the UCSC Music Department," noted music professor and Porter College Provost David Evan Jones, director of the 2008 festival. "Each year there is a different director and each one takes a different tack. The basic theme this year comes out of the focus on our program in world music composition, and the concerts channel the energy and varied interests of our faculty."</p><p>Guest performers include internationally known Korean P'ansori singer Chan E. Park-who will perform solo on the Buk (Korean barrel drum); visiting West Javanese composer Nano S, and New York clarinetist/composer Daniel Goode.</p><p>The festival kicks off on April 5 with a concert titled "The 51% Majority: Modern Works by Female Composers," performed by UC Davis's Empyrean Ensemble.

That evening will include a new piece created by music professor Hi Kyung Kim for Bay Area percussionist Ward Spangler, as well as "Cubist Staircase," the latest from David Evan Jones. "The title of my piece comes from Cubist images of jazz musicians from the 1920's," said Jones. "It sounds like a Cubist rendering of jazz--it repeats pitches and pulses like pixels and compulsively ascends again and again throughout the piece like a staircase." </p><p><i>April in Santa Cruz</i> draws to a close on April 29 with "Imagining Gamelan," featuring performances by members of the UCSC Gamelan program led by professor Linda Burman-Hall and lecturer Undang Sumarna; and the UCSC Percussion Ensemble, directed by William Winant in collaboration with the UCSC Contemporary Music Ensemble. </p><p>The complete schedule of events:</p><p><i>April in Santa Cruz Contemporary Music Festival</i> </p><p>Saturday, April 5 </p><p><b>Empyrean Ensemble: "The 51% Majority: Modern Works by Female Composers"</b> </p><p>UC Davis group performs contemporary music by Judith Weir, Sofia Gubaidulina, Unsuk Chin, Yu-Hui Chang, and world premieres by Laurie San Martin and Anne Callaway. </p><p>7:30 p.m. Music Center Recital Hall.

<p>Sociologist <strong>Marcia Millman</strong> was quoted prominently in a <em>New York Times</em> article about the news that the gang-life memoir <em>Love and Consequences</em> was a fake, a revelation made by the author's sister. Millman, author of the book <em>The Perfect Sister: What Draws Us Together, What Drives Us Apart,</em> noted that people were almost as fascinated by the sisterly relationship as by the hoax.</p>
<p>. . . Also in the <em>New York Times,</em> <strong>Steve Gliessman</strong> of environmental studies was quoted in a trend story about the growing number of young people who are becoming farmers.

<p>. . . Finally, the <em>New York Times</em> called on social psychology's <strong>Elliot Aronson</strong> for a story about buyer's remorse that focused on the "blissful ignorance" phenomenon. Aronson, an expert in cognitive dissonance, discussed the ways consumers justify their decisions and ultimately come to terms with their purchases. Aronson was also tapped by the <em>Las Vegas Sun</em> for insight into the news that a group of Las Vegas medical clinics reused syringes. Postulating that the psychological theory of "social facilitation" was at work, Aronson described how people can lull themselves into thinking their actions aren't dangerous. The story was distributed to numerous newspapers by the Scripps Howard News Service.</p>

New evidence from an eight-year study by U.S. and Chinese researchers indicates that the plateau rose in stages, with uplift occurring first in the central plateau and later in regions to the north and south.</p>
<p>"The middle part of the plateau was uplifted first at least 40 million years ago, while the Himalayan Range in the south and also the mountains to the north were uplifted significantly later," said Xixi Zhao, a research scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The team found marine fossils suggesting that the now lofty Himalayas remained below sea level at a time when the central plateau was already at or near its modern elevation, Zhao said. The average elevation of the plateau today is more than 4,500 meters (14,850 feet).</p>
<p>The researchers published their findings in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (online the week of March 24 and later in a print edition). Zhao, who is affiliated with the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, is the second author of the paper. First author Chengshan Wang of the China University of Geosciences in Beijing has been collaborating with Zhao and other UCSC researchers since 1996.</p>
<p>Known as "the roof of the world," the Tibetan Plateau was created by the ongoing collision of tectonic plates as India plows northward into Asia. Coauthor Robert Coe, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, said ideas about how the uplift of the plateau occurred have been evolving since well before his first visit to Tibet in 1988.</p>
<p>"People used to talk about the whole plateau coming up at once, but it has become clear that different parts of the plateau were elevated at different times," Coe said. "Our work shows that the central part of the plateau was uplifted first, and it seems to fit pretty well with other studies."</p>
<p>The rise of the Tibetan Plateau led to dramatic changes in the climate, both regionally and globally. For climate researchers trying to understand major episodes of global climate change in Earth's past, the timing of the uplift is a crucial piece of information.</p>
<p>"One of the traditional views of when Tibet became a high plateau is that it's a relatively recent phenomenon that happened in the last 15 million years," said coauthor Peter Lippert, a UCSC graduate student who has spent five field seasons studying the geology of the plateau. "The existence of a high plateau at least 40 million years ago could have important climatic implications."</p>
<p>The team of U.S. and Chinese geologists based their findings on extensive field studies conducted mostly in a remote interior region of the Tibetan Plateau. They focused on an area called the Hoh Xil Basin in the north-central part of the plateau. The area's geologic history is recorded in layers of sedimentary rock 5,000 meters thick. Now a part of the high plateau, it was once a basin on the northern edge of the central plateau, Lippert said.</p>
<p>"The structure of the basin and way the sediments were deposited show that it is the type of basin that forms at the base of large mountains. So we've shown that there was high topography to the south of the Hoh Xil Basin at least 40 million years ago," he said.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the team's conclusions. In addition to field studies, the researchers used a variety of laboratory techniques to analyze and date the rocks. Past changes in Earth's magnetic field, recorded in the magnetization of the rocks, provide one method of dating. Called magnetostratigraphy, this analysis was performed in Coe's laboratory at UCSC. Another dating technique used in the study, called apatite fission-track analysis, is based on the damage trails left in apatite crystals by the decay of radiogenic isotopes.</p>
<p>The researchers also discovered volcanic rock in an area of the central plateau south of the Hoh Xil Basin. The flat bed of hardened lava lies on top of tilted and folded layers of sedimentary rocks; geochronology techniques dated it to 40 million years ago.</p>
<p>"The presence of these flat-lying volcanic rocks tells us that the sedimentary rock was deformed prior to the volcanism, and it extends the age of volcanism in this part of Tibet from 15 million to 40 million years ago," Lippert said.</p>
<p>In the Himalayas, the team found fossils of marine plankton called radiolarians that turned out to be 5 million years younger than any previously discovered marine fossils from that area. The discovery narrows the window of time during which the Himalayas could have been uplifted. When the central part of the Tibetan plateau was uplifted more than 40 million years ago, Mount Everest and the rest of the Himalayas were still part of a deep ocean basin, Zhao said.</p>
<p>The Himalayan region is very complicated, however, and other groups are working to determine the timing of its uplift more precisely, said Lippert. "Our main contribution has been the data we gathered from the north-central part of the plateau, which has not been well studied," he said.</p>
<p>Zhao noted that the U.S. researchers could not have gained access to this area without the support of their Chinese colleagues. This long-term collaboration has included exchanges of graduate students between UCSC and Chinese universities, as well as opportunities for UCSC undergraduates to conduct field research in Tibet. "It has been a very good research collaboration, with a strong educational component as well," Zhao said.</p>
<p>In addition to Wang, Zhao, Lippert, and Coe, the coauthors of the paper include Zhifei Liu of Tongji University in Shanghai; Stephan Graham of Stanford University; Haisheng Yi, Lidong Zhu, and Shun Liu of Chengdu University of Technology in Chengdu; and Yalin Li of China University of Geosciences in Beijing. This research was supported in part by grants from the National Key Basic Research Program of China, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC.</p>

The problem was successfully fixed at approximately 1:00 pm and power has been restored to affected areas.</p><p>The outage this morning was due to an unexpected equipment failure on the 21,000-volt  (21kv) electrical system that powers the upper campus. A failing underground switch was discovered, and the potential for serious electrical system damage and power outage was imminent. In order to correct the problem, power was temporarily shut down in affected areas so that emergency repairs could be done.</p><p>Coincidentally, work was already planned this week to reroute the 21kv cables bypassing the switch. Unfortunately, the switch began to fail before this work could be accomplished.  Now that the switch has been corrected, work will continue on this part of the campus electrical system to bypass other suspect equipment on the 21kv, system.  Physical Plant does not anticipate further problems, and pending some other system failure, this work is not expected to result in power loss to the campus.</p><p>For your information, a new switch will be installed in December 2008 as part of campus electrical infrastructure improvements.  This upgrade will improve the campuses electrical infrastructure and minimize power failures in the future.  As always, we recognize the inconvenience such outages cause for campus operations, and appreciate the patience and understanding of impacted campus community members.</p><p>If you have any questions, please contact the Physical Plant work-order desk at 459-4444 and they will direct you to the appropriate person.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Public Information Office</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155db7c8072704601a012ffc81ada7d"><name>2055</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Inauguration of Chancellor Blumenthal to take place Friday, June 6</title><keywords>Chancellor Blumenthal, UCSC inauguration, inauguration of Chancellor Blumenthal</keywords><start-date>1206428400000</start-date><display-name>Inauguration of Chancellor Blumenthal...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2055</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2055</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338577204</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338577204</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/03/images/blumenthal_george.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/03/images/blumenthal_george.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blumenthal_george.250.jpg</name><file-size>56286</file-size><width>250</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>George Blumenthal</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We're very pleased to share the news that the inauguration of George Blumenthal as UC Santa Cruz's 10th Chancellor will take place on Friday, June 6, 2008.

The ceremony will close with a reception open to all attendees. A Steering Committee of faculty, staff, and students is overseeing coordinating the many details that will shape this special event.</p><p>It's been obvious to members of our Steering Committee that this Chancellor, with a UCSC affiliation that extends more than 35 years, takes special pride in the accomplishments of our current and former students. In fact, at Chancellor Blumenthal's request, his inauguration has been scheduled to complement the campus's annual Student Achievement Awards ceremony, which will be held on the East Field following the inaugural reception.</p><p>It is our hope--and the Chancellor's--that his inauguration will call attention to an event that each year showcases the very impressive work of our students.</p><p>A web site (<a href="http://inauguration.ucsc.edu">http://inauguration.ucsc.edu</a>) dedicated to this inauguration already includes information explaining how faculty planning to participate in the traditional academic procession can order regalia. Other information and details will be added to the site as they become known.</p><p>We sincerely hope that as many of you as possible will be able to attend Chancellor Blumenthal's inauguration. It will be a ceremony that celebrates UCSC's remarkable past and dynamic present, while giving our new Chancellor an opportunity to share his vision for UCSC's future.  It will be a moment for all of us to reflect on and to take pride in this campus that we all share.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC  Community</audience><admin>Deans Stephen Thorsett and Georges Van Den Abbeele, Chairs, Inaugural Steering Committee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155de648072704601a012ffee348b96"><name>2057</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC computer scientist Phokion Kolaitis earns 'Test-of-Time' award</title><summary>Phokion Kolaitis, professor of computer science at UCSC, published a paper in 1998 that has now been recognized as a major influence in the field of database systems.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Phokion Kolaitis</keywords><description>Phokion Kolaitis, professor of computer science at UCSC, published a paper in 1998 that has now been recognized as a major influence in the field of database systems.</description><start-date>1206514800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC computer scientist Phokion...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2057</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2057</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338577930</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338577930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/03/images/kolaitis.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/03/images/kolaitis.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kolaitis.150.jpg</name><file-size>60560</file-size><width>150</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Phokion Kolaitis</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Phokion Kolaitis, professor of computer science at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, published a paper in 1998 that has now been recognized as a major influence in the field of database systems. The paper earned Kolaitis the Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award given for the first time this year by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS). </p><p>ACM PODS is the premier international conference on database theory. The symposium's award committee recognized two papers from 1998 as having "the most impact (in terms of research, methodology, or transfer to practice) over the intervening decade," and selected them as the 2008 award winners. </p><p>The paper by Kolaitis, coauthored with Moshe Vardi and published in the Proceeedings of PODS 1998, is titled "Conjunctive-query containment and constraint satisfaction." The paper relates two important problems in the areas of databases and artificial intelligence and provides a deep complexity analysis, according to the award committee's citation. (The other paper chosen for the award is "Complexity of answering queries using materialized views," by Serge Abiteboul and Oliver Duschka.)</p><p>Currently on leave of absence from UCSC, Kolaitis is at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, where he is the senior manager of the Computer Science Principles and Methodologies Department. His research interests include logic in computer science, database theory, and computational complexity.</p><p>A Fellow of the ACM, Kolaitis has received several IBM research awards and has held a Guggenheim Fellowship. He earned a diploma in mathematics at the University of Athens and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics at UCLA.

When traveling to participate in off-campus activities sponsored and supervised by University faculty and/or staff (NCAA excluded), registered UC students will be covered worldwide, 24 hours a day, for a wide variety of accidents and incidents while away from campus. The new coverage is broader and more generous and is provided at no cost to the student. However, registered students are now required to register for all out-of-state and out-of-country UC trips to ensure their student off-campus travel accident coverage. The coverage (insurance contract governs) includes:</p>
<p>* Emergency medical evacuation - if you become ill or are injured while 100 or more miles from home, ACE will arrange emergency transportation.</p>
<p>*Accident/Sickness medical expense - $10,000 maximum per occurrence for domestic travel/$100,000 maximum per occurrence for out-of-country travel.</p>
<p>*Security extraction - if you are in a dangerous situation anywhere in the world, ACE can arrange to get you out.</p>
<p>*Travel assistance services - if you need to find a hospital, lose your passport, or need other assistance, you can call ACE and their affiliate, Europ Assistance, for help via their toll free number.</p>
<p>Action Required:</p>
<p>Prior to departure, registered students must complete the UC Business Travel Form at <a href="http://www.uctrips-insurance.org/">http://www.uctrips-insurance.org/</a>.

Under his leadership, the University of Minnesota four-campus system earned increased national prominence and enhanced public and private financial support.</p><p>A former law professor, Yudof also served as a dean and provost at the University of Texas's Austin campus. From this experience, he understands the importance of attracting and retaining top students, faculty, and staff.</p><p>Mark Yudof is an outstanding choice to lead our 10-campus system. He brings to UC extensive leadership experience, intellectual depth, uncommon political acumen, and a genuine, down-to-earth nature that will serve him well as he tackles the unique opportunities and challenges facing UC and each of its campuses.</p><p>UC campus chancellors met with Yudof this morning prior to the Regent's vote. I was heartened by his unbridled enthusiasm for UC, clear appreciation for its greatness, and devotion to leading us to even greater distinction as the world's preeminent public university.</p><p>I'm also convinced that Mark Yudof will help UC Santa Cruz continue on its upward trajectory as a top-ranked research university and the leading provider of top-quality undergraduate and graduate education. I look forward to welcoming him to our campus when he begins his presidency.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9155eb5b8072704601a012ff8a92db8e"><name>2064</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SUA Elections and Spring Quarter Announcements</title><start-date>1206428400000</start-date><display-name>SUA Elections and Spring...</display-name><path>/2008/03/2064</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/2064</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338581254</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338581254</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write to provide you information regarding the 2008 - 2009 Student Union Assembly (SUA) elections process as well as a few SUA Chair's Office announcements.

<p>Spring Quarter Events and Announcements:</p>
<p>- The Chair's Office interns of SUA are hosting a series of informational events that speak to every student on campus. Jamba Juice will help host our first event on April 9th by selling their most popular drinks for only $4.00. Then we will have Cold Stones for those ice cream lovers later in April. During the first couple of weeks the 10 colleges should expect a challenge game. Over the internet where the 10 colleges can play games online to battle each other, for fun of course. We have another informational exposure that includes In-And -Out, taking place in the Quarry later on in May.</p>
<p>All of these to be followed by a TownHall meeting that will happen towards the end of the quarter between the students and administrators about some of the concerning issues here at UCSC. We are expecting a productive Spring Quarter 2008, come and join us and look out for fliers. The town hall to be hosted by the interns of the chair of SUA is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, May 7, and will consist of a two-hour moderated forum between students and administration designed to address a host of campus wide issues related to academics, student life, development, student fees, and other issues of pertinence. Please mark your calendars so that you may come out and voice your opinions regarding these and other matters. For more information or if you would like to assist in planning the town hall forum, please contact Geoff Trautman (SUA Programming Intern) at <a href="mail%20to:gtrautma@ucsc.edu">gtrautma@ucsc.edu</a> or Christi Suchil (SUA Chair) at <a href="mailto:Chair0708@ucsc.edu"></a>.</p>
<p>Latin American Philosophy (Philosophy 80-E)</p>
<p>Prof. Rasmus Winther <a href="mail%20to:rgw@ucsc.edu">rgw@ucsc.edu</a></p>
<p>This course addresses important thinkers, particularly philosophers, in Latin America. Would any possible general school of Latin American</p>
<p>Philosophy/Thought have to appeal to quintessential Western philosophical questions regarding knowledge, values and reality? What difference does Latin American ethnic and national diversity, as well as strong political and social inequality, make to the development of core philosophical questions and frameworks? In order to attempt to answer these questions, we explore the intellectual, cultural, and historical background of Latin America by first reading *The Idea of Latin America* by Walter Mignolo and parts of *Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent* by Eduardo Galeano. We then turn to important historical thinkers such as Sor Juana de la Cruz, SimÃ³n Bolivar, and Jorge Luis Borges. We end by investigating the rich variety of contemporary Latin American Thought, including the work of the revolutionary Subcomandante Marcos, the "pedagogy of hope" of Freire as well as more orthodox contemporary analytic and continental philosophers working particularly in</p>
<p>Mexico and Argentina. Perhaps the very notion of a Latin American</p>
<p>Philosophy is an example of *orientalism*? The expectation is that this course will challenge you to reconsider how you see the nature, dynamics, historicity and cultural-specificity of Philosophy/ Thought.</p>
<p>I hope you take some of this information and use it to you advantage. Feel free to contact myself or any other SUA office (or perhaps your college representative) for more information or to get involved.</p>

Although UCSC scientists have made important contributions in many areas of health-related research, and many are leaders in their fields, awareness of their work remains relatively low among people outside the sciences, even on campus.</p><p>"For an institution of our small size, our impact on biomedical research is truly remarkable," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p><p>UCSC researchers are working on cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and infectious diseases such as AIDS, cholera, and malaria. There are groups working on an artificial retina to restore sight to the blind, a glucose sensor for diabetics, and the toxic effects on humans and in the environment of heavy metals such as lead and manganese.</p><p>The campus has been especially effective at fostering creative, interdisciplinary approaches to fundamental human health problems. "Our secret advantage is the ability of our students and faculty to cross traditional departmental lines in order to tackle really tough problems," Thorsett said. "Bringing computer science and wet lab biology together to form a world-class group in bioinformatics and genomics is one good example of that."</p><p>The absence of a medical school at UCSC rules out clinical research involving patients. But clinical advances depend on discoveries in areas such as genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and toxicology. In these areas, UCSC has built strong programs and established an impressive record of accomplishments.</p><p>In a recent survey of published research in molecular biology and genetics, two UCSC scientists--bioinformatics pioneers David Haussler and James Kent--<a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1864">ranked among the top ten authors with the most high-impact papers in this area</a>.</p><p>Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer professor of molecular biology, has won nearly every major honor in his field, including election to the National Academy of Sciences, for discovering the structure of the cellular protein machine. <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=940">His findings are being used to develop new antibiotics to fight drug-resistant infections</a>.</p><p>Much of the funding for health-related research comes from the National Institutes of Health, which provides more than $10 million in grants to UCSC researchers every year. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), meanwhile, has provided more than $9 million to fund the campus's growing stem cell research program. UCSC's ability to attract this level of funding through peer-reviewed grant programs is a testament to the quality of its health-sciences faculty and their ongoing research programs.</p><p>At the same time, the campus has created a comprehensive and innovative health-sciences major to prepare students for careers in medicine. Established in 2003 and administered by the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, the health-sciences program is the campus's fastest growing major and among its most popular. Designed with California's health care needs in mind, the program requires students to become proficient in Spanish and to do an internship in a community health care setting.</p><p>The Spanish-language component of the program teaches students both medical terminology and conversational skills, while the internship allows students to see the day-in, day-out practice of a working health professional. Health-care-professional schools are looking for people with just that kind of field experience, said Grant Hartzog, associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology and a member of the program's advisory committee.</p><p>"It's one way of measuring someone's commitment, and making sure people have a good understanding of what they're getting themselves into," Hartzog said.</p><p>The health sciences major complements the health-related research programs at UCSC. These successful programs benefit students, the state of California, and the world at large, Thorsett said. "Our faculty, researchers, and students are deeply engaged in research that will transform our understanding of health and disease, and our graduates are ready to help meet the increasingly complex technological, scientific, and social challenges that health care faces in California and the world."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27138398072704601a012ffbb9b3e21"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625583113</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625583113</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27138398072704601a012ffbb9b3e21"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625583113</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625583113</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
