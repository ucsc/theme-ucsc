You are part of an exceptional teaching and research university. Over the past week, I've had the pleasure of meeting with new students, their parents, new faculty, and graduate students. I am very impressed with the optimism and enthusiasm I've encountered.</p><p>I want to begin by thanking the hundreds of staff, faculty, and students who helped guide the campus through a busy and challenging summer, and prepared for the arrival of new undergraduate and graduate students. Some of you contribute in ways visible to many, while others' efforts occur behind-the-scenes. The campus community appreciates all that you do.</p><p>I am delighted to report that due to the diligence of many individuals and a spirit of cooperation among all parties, we reached a landmark agreement with the City and County of Santa Cruz and others on future campus development plans. We now can - and will - move forward with plans to improve our facilities and thereby enhance our teaching and research capacity. This agreement has also helped us to forge a strong working relationship with our community.</p><p>As you may have heard, two UCSC researchers and their families were targets of vile firebomb attacks in early August. It is truly gratifying to see the high level of campus and community support for these researchers and their families. UCSC scientists contribute vitally to efforts that address human health and other global challenges. They have our unwavering support.</p><p>So where are we as a campus? And where are we going? First, let me be clear that UCSC continues on a clear upward trajectory. This progress is demonstrated by several empirical measures: an increasingly selective and diverse class of incoming students; stronger philanthropic support; continued accolades for our outstanding faculty and distinguished alumni; and much more. UCSC is a national leader in quality undergraduate education and interdisciplinary research that has significant global impact.</p><p>One indicator of the quality and success of our campus is its ability to attract a group of stellar new faculty. In talking with many of the new faculty members who joined us this quarter, I was struck by their sense of excitement. They are involved in many interesting disciplines and bring fresh new perspectives and energy to campus. Their arrival comes at a time when we are revisiting our general education requirements, so their interest and involvement is most welcome.</p><p>Still another measure of UCSC's stature is the quality of new students and the degree of engagement on the part of their families. I had the opportunity to visit with many of the more than 1,600 parents who took part in receptions during student move-in weekend. Their enthusiasm and engagement reaffirmed for me that UCSC has become a "first choice" UC for more and more students.</p><p>We are, of course, not without our challenges. The state budget was finally passed and presents a sobering picture; we are facing considerable cuts even as the costs of running the university increase. At UCSC, our priority is to minimize the effects of state budget cuts on our instruction and research.</p><p>Despite the budget challenges, we have begun to implement UCSC's academic plan. We will continue working to revitalize and strengthen the undergraduate experience while we increase graduate enrollments. We will also accelerate our fund-raising efforts to meet our academic goals and ambitions. By mid-year, the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change will identify ways for UCSC to continue to reduce its carbon footprint. And we will take new steps to nurture and enhance campus diversity. I will share details about these and other campus priorities in future messages.</p><p>I wish you all an exciting and productive quarter and a great new academic year.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91581c1c8072704601a012ff3c4defe2"><name>2460</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Bill Domhoff was quoted in a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; column about the super-rich that appeared in the paper's "Week in Review" section.</summary><description>Bill Domhoff was quoted in a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; column about the super-rich that appeared in the paper's "Week in Review" section.</description><start-date>1223017200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2460</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2460</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338724836</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338724836</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</i></p><p>Bill Domhoff was quoted in a <i><b>New York Times</b></i> column about the super-rich that appeared in the paper's "Week in Review" section. </p><p>Biologist James Estes was interviewed by <b>CBC Radio</b> (Canada) about his research on sea otters in the Aleutian Islands. </p><p>The <i><b>San Jose Mercury News</b></i> published a story about the fossilized remains of a mammoth that will be featured in an upcoming exhibit being developed in collaboration with psychology professor Maureen Callanan. </p><p>Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki has fielded a flurry of election-related calls lately.

This prohibition against political campaign activity has been in effect for more than half a century and bars certain tax-exempt organizations from engaging on behalf of or in opposition to political candidates. Various University policies reflect this prohibition.</p><p>First, the University's policy on "Restrictions on the Use of University Resources and Facilities for Political Activities"(<a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/9-18-70.html">http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/9-18-70.html</a>) contains useful guidance on how to avoid the presentation of opinions in a way that mistakenly implies endorsement by the University. The policy provides that in correspondence, statements, or other materials relating to political activities (such as the expression of support or opposition to ballot measures or candidates for political office), the University title of a faculty or staff member should be used for identification purposes only. If such identification "might reasonably be construed as implying the support, endorsement, advancement, or opposition of the University," the identification should be accompanied by an explicit disclaimer that the individual is speaking for himself or herself and not as a representative of the University or any of its offices or units.</p><p>A University employee may allow use of his/her name and title for identification purposes in the same manner as others who sign an expression of support or opposition. However, an express disclaimer of University endorsement is required where the context might reasonably cause confusion as to whether the endorsement is made in an official or unofficial capacity.

(Photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>"Basically," muses Mary Silver, peering into a sample of tiny drifting algae (plankton) taken from the Santa Cruz wharf, "I'm an old-fashioned naturalist who looks at organisms with my eyes and my microscope."</p>
<p>Her research toolkit is, of course, much more high-tech than that, including underwater robots and remotely operated vehicles for deep ocean sampling. But Silver's perspective as a naturalist is at the heart of her career, which now spans more than three decades.</p>
<p>The oceanographer, 66, is best known for her landmark "marine snow" research, revealing the key role this constant shower of mainly organic detritus plays in ocean ecosystems. In recent years, Silver has shifted her attention to the harmful algal blooms (HABs) that plague coastal waters, tracing how HAB toxins cascade through marine food webs to poison fish, birds, marine mammals, and eventually humans.</p>
<p>Silver's research accomplishments more than secure her place in the annals of oceanography, but she is also widely recognized for her pioneering role as a woman field scientist.</p>
<p>"When I was a grad student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the mid 1960s, almost all researchers were male," recalls Silver. She was one of the first women to serve as chief scientist on a Scripps research vessel-and when the cook on that voyage asked her to mend his pants, "I did," she says dryly, "with a great sense of both the irony and the humor of the situation!"</p>
<p>In 1972, Silver became the third woman faculty member of UCSC's Division of Natural Sciences. She was only the second to have children, and had few role models as she balanced the birth of her first child with the demands of tenure review. According to fellow UCSC professor of ocean sciences Peggy Delaney, "Mary led the way for people with strong family commitments to go to sea; we wouldn't be here without her."</p>
<p>Silver is a valuable mentor for grad students and young faculty-and she is equally dedicated to undergraduate teaching. Top faculty rarely teach large introductory classes, but Silver loves the 200-student course Life in the Sea. "Students are so open-minded and excited," she says. "I learn as much from them as they do from me."</p>
<p>Silver plans to retire at some point but will continue teaching and research, especially, she says with enthusiasm, "spending time at sea." She will also play more music (she is an accomplished pianist and a novice hammer dulcimer player) and pursue an emerging love of photography. Silver is rapidly gaining recognition for her exquisite shots of microscopic marine organisms.</p>

But Lauf, 25, also loves teaching science--and he's found an unusual way to mesh his passions.</p>
<p>In April, Lauf and partner Danene Jones set off on a seven-month, 2,000-mile bicycle trek through Australia's Cape York Peninsula, taking their Cycling Scientists program to dozens of remote outback schools. Their dynamic shows and workshops put bikes center stage to help kids explore physics, sustainable energy, and sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>"The story line of the show is based on our cycling adventure," says Lauf. "A bicycle stand lets me 'ride' on stage, and I often jump on and off, sometimes with flaming rocket balloons on my back. A bike-powered dynamo runs lights and buzzers to show the transformation of moving energy to electrical energy."</p>
<p>A potted cactus named Charlie helps demonstrate the effects of gravity. "We swing him like a giant pendulum toward a terrified teacher's face. Just before impact, we place a balloon in front of the teacher, and Charlie slams into the balloon, popping it with his spikes."</p>
<p>But the most popular demonstration is Wheel Up a Hill. "We make a bicycle wheel</p>
<p>roll up an incline by attaching a hidden weight to the rim; the weight falls and pulls the wheel up. Kids are stunned every single time."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no such uphill magic for Lauf and Jones as they pedal their heavily loaded bikes (each carries more than 80 pounds of gear, not including food and water) up some of Australia's toughest climbs. Although Lauf keeps a sharp eye out for crocodiles, the biggest problems so far have been torrential rains and a windstorm that sent Jones's tent sailing down the highway. That and getting enough to eat. "With all this cycling, it's unbelievable how much food we consume," joked Lauf, whose lanky 6-foot frame is becoming lankier by the day.</p>
<p>Lauf and Jones are already hatching plans for new projects that mix adventure, sustainable transportation, and education. "We welcome suggestions," says Lauf. "Maybe Niagara Falls in a barrel?</p>
<p>The Sierras by pogo stick?"</p>

<p>In honor of the campus's 43rd year, here are 43 things we bet you didn't know about UC Santa Cruz. We think many of them will surprise and delight you--and maybe even inspire you to send us a few of your own.</p>
<h4>Contrary to popular opinion</h4>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Despite its reputation for having some of the top science programs in the country, the <strong>10 most popular undergraduate degrees</strong> last year were psychology, business management economics, literature, politics, history, environmental studies, sociology, anthropology, film and digital media, and community studies.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> UCSC's history of using narrative evaluations has led many to think the campus has never issued grades. In fact, <strong>faculty voted in 2001 to issue grades</strong>--in addition to the distinctive narrative system.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Huge lecture classes are the norm at most public universities, but at UCSC, 72 percent of upper-division courses and 58 percent of lower-division courses have <strong>fewer than 30 students.</strong></p>

</div>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Firmly committed to NCAA Division III status, UCSC isn't considered a sports powerhouse. But there are teams successfully competing at the national level; for example, men's tennis was the first D-III team to win both an indoor and outdoor tennis championship in the same year. Under coach Bob Hansen, the UCSC men's tennis team has won a total of <strong>six national championships.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Despite a budget that is about half the size of similar schools, UCSC's athletics program counted <strong>15 All-American athletes</strong> last year.</p>
<h4>Nurturing brainiacs</h4>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Starting from very modest beginnings in the early 1980s, UCSC's Linguistics Department has grown to be an internationally recognized force in linguistic theory. Its undergraduate program is ranked <strong>No. 1 in North America,</strong> and its graduate program is in the top five. Its graduates are sought after by high-tech companies for developing intelligent search engines, more-intelligent dialog systems, better voice recognition and synthesis systems, and increasingly, in the key areas of naming and branding.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Work being done at UCSC may one day allow the blind to see. Clinical trials are under way for an <strong>artificial retina</strong> developed by bioelectronics engineer Wentai Liu and collaborators. Ten patients are enrolled in the U.S. trial and have received the new implant.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Military strategists at U.S. Central Command invited environmental studies professor Alan Richards to <strong>brief top Pentagon officials</strong> about the war in Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> In 1984, three UCSC cosmologists and a British astronomer published a paper detailing their <strong>theory of Cold Dark Matter,</strong> which explained the existence of an invisible form of matter that can be detected only through its gravitational effects on visible matter in space. Today, their theory is the basis for the modern picture of structure formation in the universe. The scientists were Martin Rees (now the royal astronomer of Britain), Joel Primack, Sandra Faber, and the campus's newest chancellor, George Blumenthal.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> A UCSC professor found a silver lining in a failed effort to create an AIDS vaccine. Phillip Berman, chair of biomolecular engineering, helped develop an <strong>HIV data browser</strong> that gives researchers access to data from the vaccine's clinical trials that may help them better understand how the virus evolves and causes new infections.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> UCSC physicists and astronomers are among the most respected in the world. The campus was ranked <strong>first in the country</strong> for the impact of its faculty in the field of physics and fifth in space sciences for 2007. The newsletter <i>Science Watch</i> reported that a study of the number of times a published paper is cited by other researchers--a measure of important findings and ideas--put UCSC's faculty on top.</p>

<p><strong>12.</strong> Plane land right on time? You may have UCSC to thank for that some day. UCSC is managing a 10-year, $330 million national research program under an agreement between NASA and UC to work on <strong>human space exploration, air traffic management, and nanotechnology.</strong> Among projects at the University Affiliated Research Center at Moffett Field is software development that will help air traffic controllers reduce delays and increase safety for air travelers.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> UCSC astronomer Jerry Nelson helped design <strong>the world's largest optical telescopes</strong>--the twin Keck Telescopes in Hawaii. Now, Nelson is project scientist for an even bigger telescope, one that will allow astronomers to look back in time to when the first stars and galaxies were forming. The new telescope will have a 30-meter mirror, providing 10 times the light-gathering area of each of the Kecks.</p>

<p><strong>14.</strong> In 2000, UCSC researchers were the <strong>first to assemble the DNA sequence of the human genome</strong> and make it publicly available. Today, thousands of biomedical researchers worldwide use UCSC's Genome Browser in their work to uncover the causes of diseases and develop treatments.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> If you want to work faster, researchers at UCSC learned it helps to get a robot. The campus opened a Chemical Screening Center in 2007 that uses <strong>six robots and a library of 55,000 compounds</strong> to test chemical compounds for use in treating cancer, malaria, Parkinson's disease, and inflammation, among other ailments. The robots can help perform up to 30,000 experiments a day.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>16.</strong> Studying how the ungainly looking Weddell seal can hold its breath for as long as 90 minutes under the Antarctic sea ice may have implications for <strong>understanding stroke and aging in humans.</strong> A study led by UCSC professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Terrie Williams is looking at how these seals protect themselves from the effects of low levels of oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> UCSC has garnered $16 million in funding for its <strong>stem cell research center,</strong> which is doing studies that have the potential to help treat stroke, spinal cord injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain heart diseases and cancers.</p>
<h4>Alumni aim high</h4>
<p><strong>18. Five UCSC alumni have won Pulitzer Prizes.</strong> <i>Washington Post</i> reporter and Merrill College alumna Dana Priest won Pulitzers in 2006 and 2008 for reporting on the government's "black site" prisons and the mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Hector Tobar, a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter, won a Pulitzer in 1992 for coverage of the L.A. riots; Laurie Garrett won in 1996 for her reporting on the Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire; Annie Wells won in 1997 for her photo of a California flood victim; and Associated Press National Writer Martha Mendoza won a Pulitzer in 2000 for an investigative story about the massacre of South Korean refugees by the U.S. military during the Korean War.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> Since the campus opened 43 years ago, 638 UCSC alumni have heeded the call to work in developing countries for the Peace Corps. The number puts UCSC <strong>sixth in ranking among medium-sized schools</strong> for the number of alumni it has sent to the Peace Corps.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>20.</strong> One of the country's most prolific writers, with 23 million copies of her books in print, graduated from UCSC. <strong>Best-selling romance novelist</strong> Jayne Ann Krentz (Stevenson '70), who also writes under the names Amanda Quick and Jayne Castle, even included the work of one of her favorite professors, G. William Domhoff, in her 2004 novel <i>Falling Awake.</i></p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> NPR's famous duo, <strong>the Kitchen Sisters,</strong> Nikki Silva (Porter '73) and Davia Nelson (Stevenson '75), are graduates of UCSC. Over the years, the two women have attracted devoted listeners to several series, including <i>Lost &amp; Found Sound, Hidden Kitchens,</i> and the <i>Sonic Memorial Project,</i> an audio archive of the World Trade Center.</p>
<h4>Legend has it</h4>

<p><img alt="Drawing of a banana slug and a sea lion" src="images/rivalry.160.jpg"/></p>

</div>
<p><strong>22.</strong> UCSC's <strong>famous banana slug</strong> mascot almost didn't survive the '80s. Back when the university joined the NCAA, the chancellor and a group of student athletes changed the campus mascot to the sea lion, figuring a slimy yellow slug didn't have the cachet they wanted. But students revolted and, in a 1986 referendum, voted by a 15-to-1 margin to keep the banana slug, thereby guaranteeing UCSC would always join the Whittier Poets and the Ohio Wesleyan Battling Bishops on the list of most unusual mascots in the country.</p>
<p><strong>23.</strong> When the UC Regents were considering a site for a new Central Coast campus, the story goes, they considered possible locations in the Almaden Valley in Santa Clara County as well as Santa Cruz. But coming over the Santa Cruz Mountains on a blistering summer day, they felt the <strong>cool ocean breezes</strong> and picked the Cowell Ranch property in Santa Cruz.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>24.</strong> The reason dogs aren't allowed on campus is due, in part, to <strong>a goat named Samantha.</strong> Samantha, who had become besotted with a police horse named Sam and was its constant companion, was killed by a big Shepherd/Lab mix whose owner had brought it to campus for a run. The campus was already considering a no-dog policy, but Samantha's 1978 death was the last straw. You can still see Samantha's gravestone on a hill on the left side of Coolidge Drive and signs that warn against bringing dogs to the campus.</p>
<p><strong>25.</strong> UCSC has a long <strong>history of protests,</strong> but one had an especially ignominious ending. A protest over People's Park in Berkeley had brought a camp-in to the lawn of University House, and administrators had spent hours in negotiations, finally persuading campers to leave. But as protesters packed up, then-Chancellor Dean McHenry decided to take matters into his own hands and turned the sprinklers on the protesters. Needless to say, negotiators were quickly back at square one.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>26.</strong> Over the years, reports of ghostly apparitions on a fire road below Cowell College have prompted the area to be named <strong>Haunted Meadow.</strong> It was in that area on May 14, 1903, that Sarah Agnes Cowell was killed when she was thrown from a buggy after the horse bolted.</p>
<p><strong>27. Humans first arrived</strong> on what is now the campus 12,000-16,000 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>28.</strong> Within the campus boundaries are at least 50 <strong>sinkholes,</strong> dozens of springs, a number of creeks that stop abruptly and disappear underground, and two small caves. This type of topography, called karst, is common in some parts of the world but rare in the western United States.</p>

<p><strong>29.</strong> The largest holding of <strong>Edward Weston photographs</strong> in the country is in the University Library's Special Collections Department. Over the years, the library has lent a number of the influential Central Coast photographer's 900 project prints to institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the San Francisco Museum of Art.</p>
<p><strong>30. Deadheads</strong> may one day be making pilgrimages to UCSC Library's Special Collections Department--as they once did to the iconic Fillmore auditorium in San Francisco. The famous American jam band donated all of its memorabilia, from stage props to original documents and tie-dyed T-shirts, to UCSC, where it will be housed in a room appropriately dubbed Dead Central.</p>
<p><strong>31.</strong> When avant-garde <strong>composer John Cage</strong> wasn't creating music, he was hunting for mushrooms. The celebrated composer's entire mycological collection, including field guides and a mushroom tie he wore, is held by the University Library's Special Collections Department.</p>
<p><strong>32.</strong> A lot of what happens in UCSC's science and engineering departments may seem like science fiction. But if you're looking for real science fiction, you'll find some of the most famous works of the genre archived at McHenry Library. Hugo Award-winning <strong>science fiction writer Robert Heinlein</strong>--author of Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, and other classics--lived in Santa Cruz for two decades and was one of the first "friends" of McHenry Library. The author's complete archive, including original manuscripts, is available at UCSC's Special Collections.</p>
<h4>Fascinating factoids</h4>
<p><strong>33.</strong> Among all U.S. engineering schools, UCSC ranked third in the percentage of <strong>masters degrees awarded to women.</strong> In 2007, 44.2 percent of master's degrees awarded by UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering went to women.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>34.</strong> More than <strong>77,340 degrees</strong> have been awarded at UC Santa Cruz since its first graduating class in 1967.</p>
<p><strong>35.</strong> Thirty-six percent of last year's freshman class were the <strong>first in their families</strong> to attend college.</p>
<p><strong>36.</strong> The UCSC campus is home to more than <strong>500 plant species,</strong> an extraordinary level of diversity on its 2,000 acres.</p>
<p><strong>37.</strong> UCSC started a very popular <strong>computer game design</strong> major in 2006, the first of its kind in the UC system.</p>
<p><strong>38.</strong> UCSC athletic teams have taunted opposing teams by wearing T-shirts with the slogan, "Banana Slugs-No Known Predators." But that's not exactly true. On campus, <strong>known predators</strong> include California giant salamanders, garter snakes, shrews, and raccoons. Even humans have been known to eat banana slugs, in emergencies.</p>
<h4>Growing greener</h4>
<p><strong>39.</strong> More than 1,000 graduates of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture have fanned out around the globe, cultivating the seeds of sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>40.</strong> Per capita <strong>campus water consumption has fallen 40 percent</strong> since the 1980s as a result of conservation efforts.</p>

<p><img alt="Photo of a wind turbine" src="images/windturbine.140.jpg"/></p>
</div>
<p><strong>41.</strong> UCSC buys enough renewable power certificates to offset 100 percent of the electricity that powers the campus, making UCSC the <strong>sixth-largest campus purchaser of "green power"</strong> in the country, according to the EPA.</p>
<p><strong>42.</strong> Since their introduction on campus in fall 2007, Zipcars have become so popular that the UCSC fleet is the best-utilized and <strong>fastest-growing car-share program</strong> of any university in the country.</p>
<p><strong>43.</strong> About a quarter of the produce served on campus is <strong>certified organic,</strong> and approximately half of that comes from local farmers.</p>

The shattered family moved into Cordero's mother's home to plan their next move.</p><p>"I figured I could either go straight to work and barely pay the rent," she remembers, "or look for a way to make a better life for myself and my family. I decided to go back to school and realize my dreams."</p><p>Returning to community college years after she had first started, she received an A.A. degree and transferred to UCSC. Today, she is on track to graduate with a B.A. in psychology and plans to pursue a graduate degree and a career in organizational or clinical work. The future looks bright.</p><p>Success did not come easy, though.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a 'normal' student," Cordero says. "As a parent, I'm rushing from campus to pick up my kids from school, start dinner, and get them going on their homework. . . . Sometimes it gets lonely being the only parent in a classroom of younger students." </p><p>But with help from campus advisers and motivation from inspiring professors, "I'm making it work," she says, enthusiastically.</p><p>Cordero got a major boost last year when she was one of 34 undergraduates selected for a $3,000 Alumni Association Scholarship Fund award. The coveted scholarships are given to students with demonstrated financial need and the ability to overcome obstacles to higher education. Getting the renewable award was "validation that I'm worth it," says Cordero, and allows her to mesh family obligations with the demands of her senior year: an internship, graduate school applications, a full course load, and "continuing to be a 100 percent focused mom."</p><p>Donations to the UCSC Alumni Association Scholarship Fund provide support for motivated students such as Cordero, and may be made at <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu">giving.ucsc.edu.</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9158297c8072704601a012ffb1154a89"><name>2468</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founders Day dinner on October 24 </title><start-date>1223276400000</start-date><display-name>Founders Day dinner on...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2468</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2468</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338728264</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338728264</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Since its opening 43 years ago, UC Santa Cruz has achieved real distinction as a place where excellence is defined by the very special qualities of its people and programs.</p><p>On Friday, October 24, the campus's glorious past and its very promising future will be celebrated at UC Santa Cruz's second annual Founders Day dinner. It is my sincere hope that as many of you as possible can join me at this splendid event.</p><p>It is very appropriate that the theme of this celebratory event is "Fulfilling the Promise."

A 1981 graduate of Merrill College, she is an award-winning reporter for the Washington Post, who earned her second Pulitzer Prize in April for a 2007 exposé of the mistreatment of wounded Iraq war veterans at Walter Reed Medical Center.</p><p>* Narinder Singh Kapany will receive the Fiat Lux Award. This award is given by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation to alumni and friends who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university's programs and goals. A research scientist, professor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, Dr. Kapany is acknowledged by many as the "father of fiber optics."</p><p>* Patricia Zavella will be honored as UCSC's Faculty Research Lecturer for 2007-08. This award is the foremost academic research honor bestowed by UCSC's Academic Senate. A professor of Latin American and Latino Studies, she is one of the world's leading scholars in the fields of feminist ethnography and Chicana studies.</p><p>I am sure you will agree that the evening's honorees are very deserving of our appreciation and our recognition.

The dean selects recipients from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee, chaired by sociology professor Andrew Szasz, consisted of associate professor of psychology Heather Bullock, environmental studies professor Alan Richards, and research associate professor of community studies Andrea Steiner.</p><p>In addition, economics professor Daniel Friedman received the 2008 Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Division of Social Sciences. The award was established last year by social sciences dean Sheldon Kamieniecki to honor the contributions of Chemers, a professor of psychology and former acting chancellor of UCSC. It recognizes a senior faculty member who has made a major impact on her or his discipline through research and publications. Friedman works in the areas of experimental/laboratory-based economics, learning behavior and evolutionary game theory, fairness and social institutions, and their role in efficient economies.

(Phil Carter photos)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Raul Flores's father was a boy growing up in Mexico City, he loved going to the library, immersing himself in the knowledge contained in the books there, delighting in the feel of the pages, savoring their smell.</p>
<p>His dad instilled in Flores that same reverence for a library's offerings. But as a 21st-century college student, Flores, 21, goes to the library for much more than books.</p>
<p>A third-year sociology major from Mission Hills, Flores might hit the library's Media Center to check out DVDs or videotapes for class, including movies such as <em>El Rojo Amanecer,</em> about the Tlatelolco Massacre in Mexico City in 1968. He might then sit at one of the terminals in the Information Commons and search online databases for sociological articles. After working for a while, he typically meets up with friends at the library to work some more, chat, and hang out.</p>
<p>Libraries "are a lot more digital than they were in my parents' generation," says Flores. "Everything's a lot more interconnected."</p>

<p>Flores is part of a sweeping shift in how students use university libraries and, in turn, how libraries are redefining their role on college campuses.</p>

<p>Today's undergraduates--most born between 1986 and 1990--have come of age with the Internet, Google, cell phones, e-mail, RSS feeds, blogs, podcasts, file sharing, text messaging, laptops, PDAs, and wireless access. And university libraries must adapt to meet the demands of this new, digital age-and the expectations of a new, hyperconnected user.</p>

<p>"When I became a librarian, you pretty much had to go to a library to find out what they had," says UCSC University Librarian Virginia Steel. "Now, with resources like Google and other online services, you can just link to the contents of a library from anywhere."</p>

<p>In January, for example, UCSC became the first UC campus to loan a shipment of books from its library to the Google Books Library Project, which is scanning books to make the full text publicly searchable online.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean that libraries, as physical presences, are disappearing.</p>

UCSC's McHenry Library is not only moving its catalogs and collections to the Internet, but the building is being redesigned, expanded, and reorganized to accommodate new styles of learning, rapidly evolving ways of accessing and presenting information, a trend toward social gathering, and a shift in how libraries interact with their clientele. <br/>
<br/>

<p>At McHenry, a new annex has added 81,600 square feet of light-filled space in a modern, concrete-and-glass structure. Other renovations and enhancements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>An electronic research center with 60 stations to access library resources<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>An instructional design center to help faculty make innovative use of technology in instruction and research<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A "cyber study" room and the Global Village cafÃ©--an Internet cafÃ© providing <br/>
<br/>
<p>social gathering space and online access</p>

</li>
<li>Distance-learning facilities, providing support for students and faculty at remote locations, such as Silicon Valley<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Wireless networking throughout the building and outside<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Additional electronic workstations and a number of group study rooms to foster collaborative learning</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Learning through collaboration</h4>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Students collaborate much more in their learning than they did in the past," says Joan Lippincott, associate executive director of the Coalition for Networked Information in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In her observation, students today may be learning with others in a group, and may also have friends who are just there hanging out.</p>
<p>"In my generation, you had a social life in the dorm or wherever and an academic life in the classroom or library," says Lippincott, who labels herself a baby boomer. "Today's students have a much more fluid arrangement of academic and social life."</p>
<p>Libraries are also trying to pay attention to learning styles that depart from the traditional model of solitary reading, says Erika Linke, president of the Association of College and Research Libraries and associate dean of University Libraries at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>"Education today is characterized by people working together to collaborate," Linke says. "We're acknowledging different styles of learning, inquiry, and study."</p>
<p>For second-year UCSC community studies student Andres Rodriguez, UCSC's library is a far cry from the one he frequented in his hometown of Woodland.</p>
<p>"In college, people use it to socialize with other people," says Rodriguez, 20. He often uses the library for group study sessions for midterms and finals.</p>
<p>That's not to say McHenry, UCSC's Science &amp; Engineering Library, and other, off-campus libraries aren't still quiet places for study and contemplation. But now, library staffs are creating both quiet zones and areas where people can be noisier, says Lippincott.</p>

<h4>'Library 2.0'</h4>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Fifty to 100 years ago, libraries were designed around particular structures and schemes for organizing information, says UCSC's Steel.</p>
<p>"But with the advent of the web, people expect a more responsive and flexible type of structure," she says. "They've gotten used to ubiquitous Internet access."</p>
<p>To respond to the demand, UCSC Library staff decided last spring to embark on a "Library 2.0" initiative adapted from a program developed by a North Carolina librarian.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of new technologies such as instant messaging, wikis, blogging, and RSS feeds, and this was a way to get everyone on the library staff up to speed at the same time and think of ways to use these new technologies that were emerging," says Sue Chesley-Perry, digital initiatives librarian for both McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering.</p>
<p>Now, librarians go where the students are, says Perry. For example, many librarians have Facebook pages to make themselves available for questions. And several librarians who teach research workshops for specific classes are using a blog instead of a web page.</p>
<p>Despite the many new technologies, books still have an important place in research, learning, and teaching.</p>
<p>"In my classes, I tell students how to find the different data-bases and how to use them," says Brij Lunine, a UCSC lecturer in writing. "But I still make my students get into the stacks because you often find the best stuff next to the book you were looking for."</p>
<p>Student Flores agrees that, despite the shift to an online research model, a physical library is still an important part of the culture.</p>
<p>"It sounds corny, but I'd like to see my kids come to an institution like this," says Flores, gesturing to the vaulted ceilings and book-filled shelves at McHenry Library.</p>
<p>Libraries' rapid shift from print to electronic media has raised a host of complex questions around intellectual property, ownership, licensing, and preservation. While those issues will have to be solved, that's part of the excitement of being a librarian at this particular juncture, says UCSC's Steel.</p>
<p>"We're poised between the old and the new, and every day brings with it new, interesting problems to think about," she says. "The whole information environment is changing so rapidly. It's really exciting to be part of this."</p>

Built by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the LHC represents a triumph of science and international cooperation, involving thousands of physicists from hundreds of universities and laboratories in more than 80 countries. UCSC physicists played a prominent role in the design and construction of one of the LHC's main particle detectors (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2374">earlier story</a>).</p><p>When it begins operation, the LHC will simulate conditions that existed a fraction of a microsecond after the Big Bang, the primal explosion from which the universe originated.  Experiments are expected to yield new information that will alter our understanding of the physical world, including the discovery of new forms of matter and new laws of physics.</p><p>Specially commissioned by CERN for the inauguration ceremony, <i>Origins</i> features the imagery of Frans Lanting and the music of Philip Glass in a multimedia show that celebrates the wonders of the cosmos and the glory of life on Earth. Choreographed by visual designer Alexander V.

"We're interested in how parents' ways of thinking are related to their experiences with science, and how they communicate these ways of thinking to their children," said Callanan.</p><p>The project is a collaboration among Children's Discovery Museum, UCSC, and the Museum of Paleontology at UC Berkeley, with funding from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>Callanan and a team of graduate students that includes Megan Luce, a doctoral candidate in psychology, will research the educational value of the "informal learning" that takes place in the museum setting. "We'll be exploring how kids understand the evidence and relate it to theory and scientific explanations, and how parents guide children in that process," said Luce. </p><p>Callanan, who has collaborated with Children's Discovery Museum for nearly a decade, is also helping designers plan the new exhibition. Scheduled to open in 2011, the exhibit will feature a life-sized model of the full mammoth, as well as some of the fossilized remains, which include much of the skull, the tusks, teeth, and parts of a femur, the hip, and pelvis. The mammoth has been dubbed "Lupe" for the spot along the Guadalupe River where its remains were discovered in 2005. </p><p>"We are very excited to be able to continue our progressive research partnership with Maureen Callanan and her developmental psychology students through this new four-year project to create a major interactive exhibit based on the mammoth discovery," said Marilee Jennings, executive director of Children's Discovery Museum. "Our past work together has been instrumental in bridging gender and cultural issues in museum exhibit design, making what we design and build relevant and engaging to children of varying ages and backgrounds."</p><p>Exhibit stations will give young visitors many opportunities to investigate. "The stations will focus on questions kids are likely to have, like 'What is it?' and 'How old was it?' and 'How big was it?' " said Callanan. How children and families pursue those questions is the grist for Callanan's mill. </p><p>Lupe was about six-feet tall when it perished, compared to adults who could reach up to 13 feet. But some questions--like whether the mammoth was male or female and the cause of its death--remain unresolved, which gives the museum an opportunity to teach another important lesson about how scientific knowledge evolves over time, said Callanan.</p><p>"Focusing on the evidence is good for critical thinking and it helps children learn to think logically," said Callanan. "One goal is to help kids feel comfortable as people who can think about things like a scientist."</p><p>The fact that Lupe's remains were found in the vicinity of the museum is an added bonus, especially for young residents of downtown San Jose, said Callanan. "It will get them thinking about what the area was like back when this animal was walking around," she said.</p><p>The remains were discovered by San Jose resident Roger Castillo while he was walking his dog along the Guadalupe River in 2005. "He was being a scientist," noted Callanan. "He saw something and wanted to understand it, so he began asking questions."

<p>The APS awards over 40 prizes each year, but rarely do two awards go to the same university. "To get two in one year in the same department is a real coup," said David Belanger, professor and chair of physics at UCSC.</p>
<p>The Onsager and Rahman prizes were established to recognize outstanding work in theoretical statistical physics and computational physics, respectively. Both Shastry and Young are experts in condensed-matter physics and study the phenomena that allow researchers to understand, create, and exploit new materials. Advances in this field often lead to new applications, such as better superconductors and green energy technologies.</p>
<p>Shastry studies the complicated interactions of strongly correlated systems, of which the best known are high-temperature superconductors. High-temperature superconductors are easier to cool and may eventually replace the low-temperature superconductors currently used to create the magnetic fields for MRI machines and magnetic levitation trains. In addition to explaining these superconductors, Shastry's work has advanced the understanding of thermoelectric materials, which may someday be used to capture waste heat and convert it to useable energy.</p>
<p>The Lars Onsager Prize recognizes Shastry "for pioneering work in developing and solving models of strongly correlated systems and for wide-ranging contributions to phenomenological many-body theory, which have advanced the analysis of experiments on strongly correlated materials."</p>
<p>Shastry earned his B.Sc. in physics from Nagpur University, his M.Sc. from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and his Ph.D. from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003 and was elected an APS fellow in 2006. In 2000, he was elected a fellow of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World.</p>
<p>Young's research in theoretical condensed-matter physics focuses on numerical studies of phase transitions in disordered magnetic systems called spin glasses. Spin glasses are used as experimental platforms for research because they can be probed precisely with magnetic fields, and because they are relatively simple to simulate. The properties of these unusual materials change when they undergo phase transitions, analogous to the transition of liquid water to ice. Young studies these transitions, including their effects in superconducting materials. His work in spin glasses lays the foundation for solving many similar problems in other fields, such as protein folding in biology and optimization problems in computer science.</p>
<p>The Aneesur Rahman Prize recognizes Young "for his innovative and definitive numerical studies of spin glasses and the vortex glass state of high-temperature superconductors."</p>
<p>Young earned his M.A. and D.Phil. in physics from Oxford University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1985 and was elected an APS fellow in 1989. He was honored by UCSC in 2003 with the Excellence in Teaching Award and by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences with its 2004-2005 Outstanding Faculty Award. The APS selected him as one of its inaugural group of "Outstanding Referees" earlier this year.</p>
<p>The prizes will be presented at the American Physical Society meeting in Pittsburgh in March 2009.</p>

Offered through the UCSC Office of International Education (OIE), this innovative program matches EAP alumni (domestic students returning from participating in EAP studies abroad) with EAP reciprocity students (incoming international students studying at UCSC). The event provides an opportunity for international students to enhance their UCSC experience by building personal connections and a social network that will last throughout their stay in Santa Cruz; the event also enables EAP alumni to stay connected to their study abroad experience.</p><p>Students arrived at Woodstock's Pizza outdoor patio, anxious and eager to meet their international friends for the first time. Students exchanged travel stories, ate pizza, and made connections with people from different cultural backgrounds. Raffle prizes were donated by local businesses, including gift certificates from Charlie Hong Kong's restaurant, and coffee or tea "bucks" from Café Pergolesi.  At the end of the Meet and Greet, students left to socialize in the downtown area with their new friends.</p><p>Event organizers, EAP Advisor Kate Gioia and International Student Advisor Hayat Succar, were pleased with the enthusiastic student response to the event and grateful to Woodstock's for their generous support.  "This type of programming will help to foster international awareness and to strengthen intercultural relationships both within UCSC and in the greater Santa Cruz community," Succar said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91583e808072704601a012ff736a79c0"><name>2481</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCOP releases 2009 health insurance rates </title><summary>2009 health insurance rates have been released by the UC Office of the President.</summary><description>2009 health insurance rates have been released by the UC Office of the President.</description><start-date>1223535600000</start-date><display-name>UCOP releases 2009 health...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2481</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2481</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338733645</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338733645</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President has recently released information regarding 2009 Health Insurance Rates.

The renovated McHenry Library will also include a room named "Dead Central," just inside the front door, where some items from the archive will be permanently displayed and other exhibits will rotate in and out. Other universities, including Stanford and UC Berkeley, vied for the archive.

"If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"</p><p>Library staff expects the processing of the archive to take at least two years, though parts of the collections will be debuted in stages as processing progresses. The archive includes business records, correspondence, photographs, tickets, backstage passes, flyers, posters, shirts, press clips, and awards.

The archive will also feature large stage backdrops, stained-glass pieces, props from live performances, and an extensive collection of Deadhead fan mail and gifts.</p><p>Because of the monumental size and scope of the archive, a fundraising campaign has been launched to support it and to endow a permanent Grateful Dead archivist position, according to Christine Bunting, head of Special Collections at the University Library. </p><p>.

Dad worked for UC Santa Cruz for 27 years as a Project Architect, Educational Facilities Planner, and Director of Capital Planning. He was 82 and passed away on October 4, 2008.</p>

<p>Dad would tell of being interviewed by Chancellor McHenry in the fields of the old Cowell Ranch in 1964. He was hired as a Project Architect and immediately began managing four capital projects that were already in design; McHenry Library, Cowell College, Stevenson College, and the East Field House (gymnasium). Dad was involved with the planning and construction of almost every facility that has been erected on the campus. He retired from UCSC in 1991 and a great deal of his planning continued to be implemented up to the new millennium.</p>

<p>Dad graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, and from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture. He designed a home which was built for our family in 1965 and where he lived his final days. He was proud of his service to his country and retired as a Major in the Army. Dad loved to travel and had the opportunity to visit 70 different countries and all seven continents. Â He was a member of the American Institute of Architects, Theta Chi Fraternity, UCSC Retirees Association, Friends of the UCSC Library, Friends of the UCSC Arboretum, Sons in Retirement, Founding Sponsor of the National Museum of the U.S. Army, and Pre-marriage Sponsor at Saint Joseph's Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Dad is survived by my mother, Maxine Lane, who retired in 1991 as Contracts and Grants Officer after 22 years of employment at UCSC. He is also survived by his four children, eight grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. I will always be reminded of my father's accomplishments as I walk our beautiful campus and run into the many people who knew him, loved him, and worked with him.</p>

<p>The family prefers remembrances to the UCSC Foundation, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, California 95064 for the UCSC Retirees Association Scholarship Fund. Please see the obituary for memorial services on Sunday, October 12, and the following Monday.</p>

Their findings, published this week, are shocking: almost 3,000 sea turtles were found dead along a 27-mile stretch of coast during a five-year period from 2003 to 2007.</p>
<p>Led by Hoyt Peckham, a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the study underscores the enormous impact of bycatch (marine life accidentally killed by fishing operations) on sea turtles. Bycatch and, to a lesser degree, poaching are both significant threats to the survival of the endangered Pacific loggerhead sea turtle population, Peckham said.</p>
<p>"We saw what are apparently the highest documented stranding and fisheries bycatch rates in the world," he said. "But the high bycatch rates offer us all an unexpected conservation opportunity. By working with just a handful of fishermen to diminish their bycatch, we can save hundreds of turtles."</p>
<p>Peckham and his coauthors, whose findings appear in a special bycatch issue of <em>Endangered Species Research</em>, are working to increase awareness of the problems facing sea turtles in Baja California Sur. They hope this report will encourage Mexico's government agencies to finalize creation of a refuge that protects turtles and encourages sustainable fishing in the area.</p>
<p>"We have counted so many dead turtles. We have piles of data on thousands of carcasses. What we need now are conservation actions and viable solutions," said Wallace J. Nichols, research associate with the California Academy of Sciences and a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>The authors partnered with local fishermen not only to assess bycatch but also to increase awareness of its far-reaching effects and work toward ending the threat.</p>
<p>"Once they are aware of the ocean-wide impacts of their local bycatch, fishermen often strive to fish more cleanly by switching to different techniques, target species, or areas," Peckham said. "As a result, stranding rates were down in 2008."</p>
<p>In addition, local fishermen are working with the Mexican government to designate a sea turtle refuge that would officially protect an area the researchers identified as a "hotspot" of turtle bycatch.</p>
<p>Conservation tourism offers another potential solution to these problems by giving fishermen an alternative to dwindling, inefficient fisheries, Peckham said. Through training and a steady tourism market, many fishermen and former poachers have come to value sea turtles more highly alive than dead, because conducting tours can yield more income than fishing, he added. One organization that has promoted ecotourism in this area is the Ocean Conservancy through its <a href="http://www.seeturtles.org">SEE Turtles</a> program. The program links travelers with critical sea turtle conservation sites so that vacation dollars can both protect the sea turtles and enhance the livelihood of community residents who protect them.</p>
<p>North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles travel more than 7,000 miles from Japan to Baja California Sur to feed and grow in nearshore waters, spending up to 30 years there before returning to Japan to breed. The number of nesting females in Japan has declined by 50 to 80 percent over the past 10 years, Peckham said.</p>
<p>In addition to Peckham and Nichols, the authors of the new study include Tim Tinker, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; David Maldonado Diaz and Alexander Gaos of Grupo Tortuguero, a nonprofit conservation group based in La Paz; and Volker Koch and Agnese Mancini of the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur.</p>

Violent stellar interactions serve as natural experiments, enabling scientists to study exotic phenomena that cannot be created in a laboratory.</p>
<p>"Some of the wildest, most elusive phenomena are revealing themselves as we begin to explore the universe in a more systematic way," said Ramirez-Ruiz, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and the latest young scientist at UCSC to receive a prestigious Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>"Observational astronomy is moving toward an era of celestial cinematography," he said. "Instead of static images of the sky, we are going to have a stream of data showing how the universe evolves in real time."</p>
<p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz is developing the conceptual framework needed to understand the observational data coming from new telescopes and astronomical surveys. He uses computer simulations to explore transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars--especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. The simulations yield signatures for what certain events should look like, which can then be compared to observations.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz works closely with observational astronomers and has been instrumental in many productive collaborations, according to Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a leader in the field of high-energy astrophysics.</p>
<p>"He is one of the top young scientists in his generation," Woosley said. "He works with everybody and is very good at getting observers and theorists together to pursue their common interests."</p>
<p>A native of Mexico City, Ramirez-Ruiz came to UCSC in part because of the opportunities for collaborative projects between UC and Mexican scientists. He is currently involved in a project to build a 6.5-meter telescope in Mexico for the synoptic all-sky infrared (SASIR) survey.</p>
<p>"Of course, the strength of the department was the main factor that attracted me to UCSC, but I also saw opportunities to make lasting connections and contributions to my country, and it has worked out really well," said Ramirez-Ruiz, who was named one of the 10 Best Mexican Young Scientists by a leading Mexican science magazine in 2006.</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowship gives Ramirez-Ruiz $875,000 over the next five years to support his research. He is the ninth UCSC faculty member to receive a Packard Fellowship, awarded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to support young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity. Previous recipients include astronomer Constance Rockosi in 2006 and anthropologist Nathaniel Dominy in 2007.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz earned a B.S. in physics at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge (U.K.). Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a long-term member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p>

The agreement, "forged a new way of relating to our community," he said, and "we need to build upon it in the future."</p><p>Joking that he had been avoiding talking about the budget, Blumenthal said, the campus will have to endure budget cuts but that planning has been underway for months. He said he is determined to "minimize cuts to instruction and research." </p><p>The cuts will be challenging to everyone, he said, adding "we've been here before in our history. I can remember more periods of budget cuts than I care to." He encouraged patience and "continued commitment to UCSC because we're going to get through this. This is not forever."  Blumenthal promised to update the campus when more information is available. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915855d18072704601a012ff5d926214"><name>2496</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Policy on Reemployment of UC Retired Employees </title><start-date>1224140400000</start-date><display-name>Policy on Reemployment of...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2496</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2496</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338739594</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338739594</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University invites your comments on the proposed policy on Re-employment of UC Retired employees into Senior Management Group and Staff positions. </p><p> </p><p>This policy governs the reemployment of all former UC employees (Senior Management Group (SMG) members, staff personnel and academic appointees) who have separated from University employment and have elected monthly retirement income or a lump sum cashout from the University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP), and who are rehired into SMG or staff positions.</p><p> </p><p>The policy which replaces the Guidelines for Rehire of UC Retirees was developed to:</p><p>(1)   ensure compliance with Internal Revenue Service restrictions on distributions of pension benefits prior to an employee's separation from service  or attainment of  "normal retirement age" as defined under UCRP  and</p><p>(2)   address the University's concerns regarding operation of a public retirement plan, administrative feasibility, and compliance with University policy.</p><p> </p><p>Details about the proposed policy may be found at: <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/Reemployment_UCRetired_EmployeesOct%202008.pdf">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/Reemployment_UCRetired_EmployeesOct%202008.pdf</a></p><p> </p><p>Comments may be provided by November 3, 2008.

His work on coevolution and plant-animal interactions have been particularly influential, Lundberg said.</p><p>Thompson, the author of three books on coevolution, studies how interactions among species organize Earth's biodiversity over broad geographic landscapes. "One of the great problems to solve in biology is how coevolution has fueled the diversification of life and organized it into complex webs of interacting species," he said. </p><p>The goal of Thompson's work has been to develop a science of coevolutionary biology that takes into account how species coevolve across complex and ever-changing environments. </p><p>"We now know that geographic mosaics of coevolution can become altered over time scales as short as a few decades," he said. "That observation makes our developing understanding of the coevolutionary process increasingly relevant to conservation biology, restoration biology, epidemiology, and agriculture at a time when our societies are transforming all the major ecosystems on Earth. My decades of studying coevolving interactions have made me appreciate the irreplaceable importance to science and society of the few remaining wilderness areas on Earth."</p><p>Thompson will give the Per Brinck Oikos Award Lecture at the Swedish Oikos Society meeting in Uppsala, Sweden, in February 2009. The award is sponsored by the Per Brinck Foundation at the editorial office of the journal <i>Oikos</i> and Wiley/Blackwell Publishing.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91585a5e8072704601a012ff40039ee2"><name>2499</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Detours during Bay Street resurfacing through Oct. 31</title><start-date>1224140400000</start-date><display-name>Detours during Bay Street...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2499</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2499</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338740778</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338740778</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz City Public Works Department has notified the campus that the final phase of the Bay Street Resurfacing Project, from Mission Street to Escalona Drive, is scheduled to begin by Monday, October 20th and continue through Friday, October 31st.

<p>In all, the campus will be closed for nine days of which four days are scheduled holidays (December 24, 25, 31, 2008 and January 1, 2009), two days are weekend days, and three days (December 26, 29, and 30, 2008) are campus closure days.</p>
<p>The closure may result in employees being required to use vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for the three days of December 26, 29 and 30, 2008. Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation will be allowed to use up to three days of vacation leave prior to actual accrual. Employees normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use vacation even if the required waiting period hasn't been completed.</p>

<p>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure. Fiscal-year appointees will be expected to use vacation for this period, if the closure precludes their working.</p>

<p>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus closure period should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming in November 2008. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.</p>

<p>Scheduled campus electrical outages during campus closure may impact those units who normally maintain operations during the closure periods. Information regarding these scheduled electrical outages will be sent in the near future.</p>

<p>Now a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, Costa is a leading authority on marine mammals, seabirds, and the impacts of humans on marine environments. His appointment this year to UCSC's Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health recognizes Costa's important contributions in these areas and provides support for his research and related activities.</p>
<p>Costa said he plans to use the funds from the endowed chair to support graduate students and to expand his public outreach efforts at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. His work with albatrosses, elephant seals, and other "charismatic megafauna" has frequently drawn the attention of the public and the media.</p>
<p>"I find it increasingly important to find ways of communicating our research to the public," he said.</p>
<p>Costa has used funds from his research grants to help develop new displays at the Seymour Center, including a "Dynamic Planet" display that projects the movements of elephant seals and sooty shearwaters onto a translucent globe of the Earth. With funds from the Ocean Health chair, he plans to develop a display focusing on albatross research, including tracks of albatross flights on the Dynamic Planet and videos describing the research.</p>
<p>"The idea is to assist in the development of displays and videos at the Seymour Center that will be modified or updated each year of the endowment," he said.</p>
<p>Most of Costa's current research focuses on how marine mammals and seabirds seek and find food. In particular, he is interested in how the foraging behavior and success of these animals depends on climate-driven oceanographic processes, such as coastal upwelling and shifting boundaries between warm and cold masses of ocean water. These studies are critically important for understanding how climate change will affect populations of marine mammals and seabirds, Costa said.</p>
<p>"Marine predators rely on ocean processes to concentrate their prey in a predictable way," he said. "But we don't understand how these processes are linked with foraging behavior, or what changes might happen as a result of human influences on the ocean environment."</p>
<p>Costa has been a pioneer in the use of electronic tags to track the movements of marine animals. He and his collaborators have developed tags for elephant seals and other marine mammals that not only track their movements but also gather oceanographic data and send the information back to researchers via satellites. This work has been especially valuable in obtaining water temperatures in the Southern Ocean near the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, part of which broke off earlier this year as a result of the warming climate.</p>
<p>"Our seals have been collecting temperature and salinity profiles in the immediate vicinity of the Wilkins Ice Shelf since 2005," Costa said.</p>
<p>In 2000, Costa joined Barbara Block of Stanford University and others to establish the <a href="http://www.topp.org">Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP)</a> program, which has been gathering data from 23 top marine predators to document their movements and predict habitat changes due to climate change. Costa directs the marine mammal and seabird portions of the TOPP program. Researchers tag animals with temporary electronic devices that gather information on animal movements and habitat use, as well as oceanographic data.</p>
<p>"Studies like these are essential," Costa said. "This information will allow us to protect important marine organisms, and it will enable us to differentiate human-induced changes from natural variations in the marine environment."</p>
<p>The Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health was established in 1998 and is intended for an outstanding scholar with research interests in the area of ocean health. Costa's five-year appointment to the chair includes $25,000 per year to support teaching, research, outreach, and graduate fellowships. He is the third faculty member to hold the chair, succeeding Kenneth Bruland, professor of ocean sciences.</p>
<p>Costa received his B.A. in biology from UCLA and his Ph.D. in zoology from UCSC. He then worked for five years as a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1991. A fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, Costa has been a visiting scholar at the British Antarctic Survey and the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology and was the first Zoologist in Residence at the University of Tasmania in Australia. In 2006, the Costa Spur in Antarctica, a promontory in the Ross Sea, was named in recognition of his contributions to Antarctic research.</p>

The gas was expelled from the quasar and its enormous black hole sometime in the space of four years around 10 billion years ago--an extremely brief and ancient blip detectable only through the unlikely convergence of two separate observational efforts. </p><p>"It was completely serendipitous," said Fred Hamann, a UF astronomy professor. "In fact, the only way it could have happened is through serendipity."</p><p>The discovery was initiated when UCSC undergraduate Kyle Kaplan earlier this spring noticed peculiarities in the spectra, or wavelengths of light, that had been observed and recorded from the quasar. Kaplan was working with Jason X. Prochaska, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, who had gathered the spectra in 2006 (together with former UCSC undergraduate Stephane Herbert-Fort) as part of an effort to study the galaxies between the quasar and Earth. Prochaska  was aware of Hamann's work on quasars and asked him to take a closer look.</p><p>"It is much to Kyle's credit that he chose not to ignore these changes in the quasar, which were unrelated to his research," Prochaska said. "As with many great discoveries in astronomy, one must always be open to the unexpected." </p><p>A paper about the research appeared online this month in the <i>Letters of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>.</p><p>Quasars are enormously bright cores of very distant galaxies thought to contain supermassive black holes a billion times larger than our sun. They are seen only in the centers of very distant galaxies that formed long ago--galaxies whose light is just now reaching Earth after billions of years in transit. The quasar in question is about 10.3 billion light years from Earth.</p><p>The black holes within quasars are invisible, but the cosmic material cascading toward them builds up and forms hot "accretion" disks, the source of quasars' intense light. Some of the incoming material also can be expelled from quasars to form enormous gas clouds that zoom out at extremely high speeds. With the quasar in question, the gas is flowing at an astonishing rate of 58 million mph, Hamann said.</p><p>But while astronomers had observed the presence of such gas clouds with other quasars, they had never witnessed one actually coming into being--until now.</p><p>Following up on Kaplan's observations, Hamann and other astronomers checked the 2006 spectra against the spectra of the same region recorded in a separate sky survey in 2002. To their surprise, they found no evidence of the gas cloud in 2002.</p><p>"So that's how we know this appeared between 2002 and 2006," Hamann said.</p><p>The discovery opens a window to understanding more about how quasars come into being and their role in the evolution of galaxies. </p><p>"The fact that we saw one appear in so short a time frame means that it's a volatile type of structure," Hamann said.

For another, it was as shocking as being shot by the wife he'd battered for years. </p><p>For both men, these events marked the beginning of a process of questioning their manhood that led them to a new definition of masculinity centered around the values of feminism. </p><p>Although the details are different, transformation is a theme that runs through the life stories of 20 black men whose experiences are presented in the new book <i>Ain't I a Feminist? African American Men Speak Out on Fatherhood, Friendship, Forgiveness, and Freedom</i> (Albany, NY: State University New York Press; 2008). The book is an interview-based study of contemporary African American feminist men that underscores how profoundly sexism harms men as well as women, said author Aaronette M. White, associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"These men challenge narrow definitions of manhood and masculinity," said White. "They challenge us to broaden our definition of what it means to be a man." And their triumphs signal a path that has the potential to overcome persistent problems of domestic violence, broken families, and estranged relationships, she said.</p><p>Feminists, according to White's definition, believe there is an unfair imbalance of power between women and men and that the imbalance ought to be corrected, and they are willing to take actions, privately and publicly, to correct the imbalance.</p><p>For black men, feminism can be a positive force that enhances romantic relationships, friendships with other men, and relationships with children, said White, whose findings are based on in-depth interviews and an extensive written survey administered to each participant. Her subjects, whose identities are not revealed in the book, were hand-selected from a pool of about 50 men, all of whom were self-identified feminists.</p><p>"These men have defied the odds," said White, whose book breaks new ground in the empirical study of black feminist men. "Their lives help define what it means to be a feminist and an ethical human being."</p><p>The book's title, <i>Ain't I a Feminist?</i>, refers to a phrase attributed to Sojourner Truth, the former slave and abolitionist who delivered a powerful speech entitled "Ain't I a Woman?" to the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in 1851. During the political struggle over the 15th Amendment, which ultimately gave black men the right to vote, Truth argued that women, too, deserved access to the ballot--and not only white women.</p><p>"I consider these men to be the sons of Sojourner Truth, because they refuse to place race above gender, or gender above race," White said of her subjects. "Feminism benefits everyone. Feminism is truly for everyone."</p><p>But being a black man and a feminist isn't easy, said White, noting that feminist women friends provided valuable support and inspiration to feminist men as the men challenge social norms in their search for nontraditional ways of being "masculine." "One of the things they have to come to grips with is their sexuality and their own internalized homophobia, because there's a whole world out there that believes that if a man is a feminist, he must be gay," she said. "They have to feel strong in whatever their sexuality is."</p><p>Another theme that emerged from the interviews was empathy for mothers. The men also embrace feminist parenting practices that oppose corporal punishment, and they believe a man's role includes nurturing the emotional well-being of family members and not just providing financial support. Finally, they value a vision of "politically conscious" parenting that encompasses anti-racist and anti-homophobic childrearing.</p><p>White, who concedes that she began the project with "a healthy dose of skepticism about the sincerity of men's involvement in feminism," said her research has convinced her of the transformative power of feminism in the lives of black men in particular, and men in general. </p><p>"We need to begin teaching women's studies and discussing gender issues in preschool and elementary grades to promote feminist values of nonviolence, humility, empathy, and accountability," said White. "And we need to reform workplace policies that bar men from participating fully in family life. We need paid family leave, we need to enforce equal pay for equal work."</p><p>"Becoming a feminist includes a combination of individual and institutional changes that provide opportunities for women and men to think and act in ways that challenge sexist, racist, and homophobic norms," she said.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: White may be reached at (831) 459-3557 or via e-mail at awhite1@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91586d2c8072704601a012ff10c4ed6b"><name>2511</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumnus looks to expand support for innovative program</title><summary>Victoria Wilder Eisenberg lived in more than 20 foster homes while she was growing up.

Despite that formidable obstacle, last year Eisenberg reached a goal that only about 28 percent of Americans have attained: getting a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>Eisenberg got help in achieving that milestone from the Smith Renaissance Society, a grassroots, alumni-initiated effort that provides financial, academic, and emotional support to UCSC students who are orphans, veterans of the foster-care or juvenile-justice systems, or others who have been forced to experience life on their own.</p>
<p>"As you can imagine, trying to fit into the college experience was hard," says Eisenberg, "because I knew I wasn't like everyone else, especially those who had families."</p>
<p>The Smith Society was founded in 1999 by Bill Dickinson (Cowell '68, pictured below), who, like Eisenberg, had been on his own when he arrived on the newly opened UCSC campus in 1965.</p>
<p>Since graduating, Dickinson has had several successful careers as an educator, speechwriter, business journalist, and entrepreneur. But he says the accomplishment that makes him most proud is his enduring legacy of helping students in need.</p>
<p>When Eisenberg arrived at UCSC, she had been homeless for months, having been "emancipated" from the foster care system.</p>
<p>Getting support from the Smith Society was transformative.</p>
<p>"I became a part of the Smith Society, and my [life] changed dramatically," Eisenberg says. "I have been cared for, nurtured, and, like a little seed, have grown into a beautiful spring blossom."</p>
<p>While completing a major in theater arts, she served as a Smith Society student leader, was involved in student drama productions, got married, and had two children.</p>
<p>Since its inception, nearly 150 students like Eisenberg have been served by the Smith Society program. All but a handful have graduated or are on track to graduate--a remarkable record.</p>
<p>Dickinson credits his years at UCSC--the creative, interesting education and supportive community presided over by Cowell College founding provost Page Smith and his wife, Eloise--with his success. The Smith Renaissance Society was named in their honor.</p>
<p>"Page and Eloise treated me with real respect, an uplifting first for me," Dickinson says. "We aim to provide that sort of lift for our students, which helps account for our awesome retention and graduation rates. The Smith Society needs more funding. Two hundred new donors giving at least $100 a year would keep our noble little boat afloat," says Dickinson.</p>
<p>As the society moves toward its 10th year of operation, increased financial support will provide scholarships for students; ultimately, supporters aim to establish an endowment to ensure the program's smooth operation into the future.</p>

"It exemplifies being community--people helping their neighbors. It's heartwarming."</p><p>Campus campaigns from 2002 through 2008 have raised a total of $495,902 in donations.</p><p>United Way of Santa Cruz County gives money to local health and human service agency programs that help children, the elderly, the disabled, and families in crisis.</p><p>The stories of those the United Way has helped can be poignant, said Evanovich. </p><p>For example, in 2006, a woman named Patch was an exchange student from Thailand, divorced from an abusive husband she met in Santa Cruz, homeless and alone in this country with a three-year-old child. She lived in a shelter before she moved to permanent housing through the help of Families in Transition, one of the programs supported by the United Way of Santa Cruz County. She was able to get training, legal advice, counseling, and other assistance. </p><p>Now Patch is a full-time student at Cabrillo College with a goal of obtaining a bachelors degree. </p><p>In last year's campaign, UCSC raised $64,500, with a campus participation rate of 7.9 percent, or 331 donors. Participation rates have been declining over the past several years, however, Evanovich said. In 2004, the rate was 14.5 percent. Evanovich's $75,000 goal would equal a participation rate of 15 percent, she estimated.</p><p>People shouldn't think their donation is too small. </p><p>"Just $2 a month times 4,000 employees equals an amazing $96,000 a year," Evanovich said. "It's the power of many." </p><p>"It's okay to designate your gift to one or two programs that inspire you the most," said Murphy. "Yet, be confident that your money will be well used where the need is greatest if you don't designate a specific program. And now, with times so tough and uncertain, I hope people will give something--a gift of any amount--to make a world of difference to those with so little."</p><p>Staff and faculty have the opportunity to use payroll deduction to make a gift through United Way, which reduces taxable income. Donations are also accepted by check or credit card. </p><p>"It's an opportunity for employees of our campus to help our community become a better place for our families and neighbors and coworkers," Evanovich said. "As one of the county's largest employers, we want to show our support." </p><p>For information about United Way, visit its <a href="http://www.unitedwaysc.org/">web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915870638072704601a012ff99354b88"><name>2513</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;i&gt;Irish Times&lt;/i&gt; quoted linguistics professor Jim McCloskey for an article about attitudes towards the Irish language in Ireland.</summary><description>The &lt;i&gt;Irish Times&lt;/i&gt; quoted linguistics professor Jim McCloskey for an article about attitudes towards the Irish language in Ireland.</description><start-date>1224831600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2513</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2513</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338746406</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338746406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

(Photos by r. r. jones) </image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The second annual UC Santa Cruz Founders Day gala dinner drew more than 350 people to the Cocoanut Grove Friday night to celebrate the founding ideals of the campus and the outstanding accomplishments of three individuals with ties to UCSC. </p><p>Guests were treated to <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/founders/">three video presentations</a> extolling the career achievements of alumna and <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Dana Priest; Professor Patricia Zavella; and Narinder Kapany, a research scientist, entrepreneur, and former UCSC professor. </p><p>In a video interview, Ben Bradlee, longtime executive editor of the <i>Washington Post</i> and now the paper's vice president at large, said Priest has "one of the best newspaper minds I've ever seen. She's the best in the business." Priest, a 1981 Merrill College graduate in politics, is an investigative reporter at the <i>Post.</i> </p><p>She won her second Pulitzer Prize in April, this time for Public Service with another <i>Post</i> reporter and photographer for their exposé of the mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She previously won in 2006 for revealing secret overseas prisons and extraordinary rendition used by the CIA. </p><p>In accepting the 2008 Alumni Achievement Award from the Alumni Association, Priest noted that she was once nearly kicked out of UCSC for missing a deadline and thanked the university for "being flexible and letting me stay."</p><p>Earlier Friday, Priest spoke on campus (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2516">related story</a>) and met with students. She said she was asked about her politics. Stressing that she tries to play it down the middle, she said her politics are "about making a difference, righting a wrong."</p><p>She visited Santa Cruz with her son, a high school senior, who is considering UCSC among his college choices. </p><p>Zavella, a professor of Latin American and Latino Studies, was honored for being selected by the Academic Senate as the Faculty Research Lecturer. She is one of the world's leading scholars in the fields of feminist ethnography and Chicano/a studies. Her lecture will be February 10, 2009. </p><p>Zavella said she first visited UCSC during a summer session and later, when she was hired, realized she had found her "dream job." There is at UCSC "an incredible sense of community that students, faculty, alumni all feel we are a part of," she said.</p><p>Kapany, a research scientist, professor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, conducted research in the early 1950s that demonstrated light could be passed through bent optical fiber. He has often been called the "father of fiber optics."</p><p>He received the Fiat Lux Award from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation given to alumni and friends who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the campus's programs and goals.</p><p>Kapany, a trustee of the foundation since 1994, noted that Fiat Lux means "let there be light." He thanked his wife of 55 years, Satinder, for giving him the "freedom to indulge in these various activities. She supported me every step of the way."</p><p>Chancellor George Blumenthal said Priest, Zavella, and Kapany are the kind of success stories UCSC's founders had in mind when they established the campus more than 40 years ago.</p><p>"Together, these three individuals exemplify what is unique and what is outstanding about UC Santa Cruz," he said. "Innovation, scholarship and research, determination, public service, and a desire to make the world a better place." </p><p>Campus and community patron Rowland Rebele and local business leader Sandi Eason served as masters of ceremonies for the sold-out event that drew area luminaries from political, business, and university circles. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915875778072704601a012ff01626dde"><name>2516</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Next president must scrutinize counterterrorism initiatives, says alumna Dana Priest </title><summary>Alumna Dana Priest discussed national security issues before a capacity crowd in the Namaste Lounge on Friday.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>priest, security, pulitzer, counterterrorism, politics</keywords><description>Alumna Dana Priest discussed national security issues before a capacity crowd in the Namaste Lounge on Friday.</description><start-date>1225090800000</start-date><display-name>Next president must scrutinize...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2516</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2516</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338747669</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338747669</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/10/images/priest.dana.with.student.2008.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/10/images/priest.dana.with.student.2008.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>priest.dana.with.student.2008.250.jpg</name><file-size>12346</file-size><width>250</width><height>170</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Dana Priest meets with students after her talk. (Photo by Terry Way)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The next president of the United States must conduct a rigorous inventory of post-9/11 counterterrorism initiatives to determine whether they're effective and worthwhile.</p><p>That was the message delivered Friday by UCSC alumna Dana Priest, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i>. Priest (B.A. politics, 1981, Merrill College) was on campus to accept the 2008 Alumni Achievement Award at the Founders Day celebration Friday evening. Earlier in the day, she gave a lunch-hour talk about the national security issues that will face the next president.</p><p>Priest urged the next president, whether it's Barack Obama or John McCain, to scrutinize defense and intelligence programs to determine whether they "make us safer and promote the democratic values that support and enhance the U.S. way of life."</p><p>"No one has had the nerve, the guts to take that issue on," said Priest, conceding that it's "still so easy to call somebody weak on terrorism and frighten them out of doing what I call basic accountability."</p><p>Priest, who won a second Pulitzer Prize for her 2007 exposé of the deplorable conditions facing wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, said the next president owes it to future soldiers to "try to make war the last solution."</p><p>Numerous major, costly initiatives launched since 9/11 warrant scrutiny, said Priest, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence, as well as secret programs such as the CIA's "black site" prisons, which Priest exposed in work that earned her her first Pulitzer Prize. </p><p>The next president must ask if these initiatives and many more have "really gotten us what we want," urged Priest.</p><p>"Are we spending money for something we don't need?" Priest asked of government operations designed to fight domestic terrorism.</p><p>If the terrorist threat doesn't warrant all of the spending, then one of the biggest issues facing the next administration will be trying to reign in the bureaucracies, said Priest.</p><p>That effort would surely to be complicated by the forces of popular public opinion, as well as by the influence of lobbyists representing what Priest referred to as the "industry that has grown up" around national security needs.</p><p>But a "serious lack of oversight" on the part of the executive branch and Congress must be reversed, she said. "The agencies that are involved have learned very clever ways to keep [government overseers] at bay," said Priest. </p><p>Referring to recent court rulings that have chipped away at the Bush administration's interpretation of executive authority, specifically regarding Guantanamo Bay prisoners, Priest noted that "they haven't voluntarily given up anything." </p><p>Similarly, although the CIA's secret prisons are "to the best of my knowledge currently on hold," Priest said the government has not disbanded the program. Rather, prisoners have been moved to facilities run by host nations such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, and Tunisia, where U.S. intelligence personnel operate, she said. "They've been suspended but they're not dead," she said. "They've been diverted into another form."</p><p>A major consequence of the Bush administration's focus on military solutions to the terrorist threat is that the diplomatic corps now functions as a "shadow military corps," said Priest. "We need a big shift in how diplomats think about their jobs. We need to empower and reinvigorate the State Department and the nonmilitary actors in government." </p><p>As a journalist, Priest remains nonpartisan, but she said Obama and McCain have very different ideas about international engagement. If Obama is elected, much of the world will "forgive the U.S. unilateralism that has caused so much grief around the world," she said. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915877108072704601a012ffa7512443"><name>2517</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Eileen Zurbriggen of psychology was quoted in a story about sexy Halloween costumes for young girls that was distributed by &lt;b&gt;Newhouse News Service&lt;/b&gt;.</summary><description>Eileen Zurbriggen of psychology was quoted in a story about sexy Halloween costumes for young girls that was distributed by &lt;b&gt;Newhouse News Service&lt;/b&gt;.</description><start-date>1225436400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2517</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2517</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338748124</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338748124</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

"This has been established by numerous scientific studies. "</p><p>He went on to argue that African American Vernacular English should be treated as an asset rather than a burden, and instead used by teachers to help students transition to standard English as they learn to read and write.</p><p>Born in Guyana, Rickford had never heard of Santa Cruz or even visited the United States until "a wise U.S. scholarship committee in the 1960s recommended a new branch of the University of California." </p><p>He came to UCSC in 1968 on a Fulbright undergraduate scholarship and ended up designing his own major in sociolinguistics. Rickford graduated from UCSC in 1971 with highest honors and went on to earn his Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>"Stevenson College was a wonderful place for me, and I really loved it here at UCSC," Rickford noted.  "UCSC gave me the freedom to design my own major and the opportunity to learn how to use linguistics to solve real problems in education."</p><p>Rickford has spent more than 40 years studying varieties of English spoken by poor and marginalized communities--examining how they are structured, how they evolve, and what role they should have in the classroom. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English</i>, which received an American Book Award in 2000.</p><p>Rickford gave examples of many of the techniques linguists are using to narrow the black/white achievement gap in schools-some of which have created public misunderstandings such as the Ebonics controversy in Oakland schools during 1996-97. </p><p>He cited promising strategies such as improving teachers and parents' negative attitudes and expectations about vernacular English, contrasting vernacular and standard English so students can better understand and move fluently between them, and using materials written in vernacular English as an initial means of developing literacy skills to help students learn standard English. </p><p>"The California Department of Education is currently embarking on a revolutionary effort-turning to linguists and asking them to help students who are having trouble with the transition from vernacular to standard English," Rickford observed. "2009 will see a new set of texts directed at African American students," he added.</p><p>The lecture was organized jointly by the Department of Linguistics and by Stevenson College, with some funding support from the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Visiting Professor program, which was designed to enrich undergraduate education at UCSC. The endowment provides financial support enabling the colleges--on a rotating basis--to bring people of academic distinction to campus.</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91587be38072704601a012ff05eea7ec"><name>2520</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>San Francisco mayor urges UCSC students to vote</title><summary>San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom made an appearance on campus Tuesday, drawing a crowd of approximately 300 students and others to the College 10 Multipurpose Room at lunchtime. </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Mayor Gavin Newsom, Proposition 8, Proposition 4, Ryan Coonerty</keywords><description>San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom made an appearance on campus Tuesday, drawing a crowd of approximately 300 students and others to the College 10 Multipurpose Room at lunchtime. </description><start-date>1225177200000</start-date><display-name>San Francisco mayor urges...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2520</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2520</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338749341</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338749341</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/10/images/newsom.gavin.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/10/images/newsom.gavin.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>newsom.gavin.250.jpg</name><file-size>9690</file-size><width>250</width><height>174</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom appeared at the College 10 Multipurpose Room Tuesday.

<p>Caldwell, an associate professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, welcomes the opportunity to broaden the terms of the discussion of global hunger, food production, and distribution.</p>
<p>"Representatives of corporate agriculture, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund make it sound like new agricultural technologies will take care of everything, but hunger and food insecurity are far more complex than that," said Caldwell. "Politics, war, geography, and even consumer preferences play key roles in whether people are hungry or not."</p>
<p>Caldwell, coeditor of <em>The Cultural Politics of Food and Eating</em> and author of <em>Not by Bread Alone: Social Support in the New Russia</em>, will join representatives of academia, government, nongovernmental organizations, and multinational corporations when they gather November 8-9 at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.</p>
<p>The workshop will focus on three factors that organizers say are contributing to the current food crisis: Food prices have jumped more than 80 percent in the past three years; obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases are driving skyrocketing health-care costs; and outbreaks of cross-national food contamination are increasing as national and global food safety systems are breached.</p>
<p>Solutions lie at the interfaces between agriculture, agri-food business, and health systems, according to organizers of the McGill Health Challenge Think Tank's "From Crises to Convergence: A Multi-Track Pathway for Green Revolution Version 2.5." The workshop will bring together experts in agriculture, food production, marketing, finance, health, nutrition, and community development to foster discussion and generate "convergent" policy strategies.</p>
<p>The title of the workshop refers to the evolution of global food-security strategies. Green Revolution Version 1.0 began in the 1950s with a focus on high-yield varieties, more fertilizers, and irrigation. Green Revolution Version 2.0 focused on increasing the productivity of small farms in subsaharan Africa and South Asia to move millions out of extreme poverty and reduce hunger. Green Revolution Version 2.5 represents a "multi-track" approach to worldwide sustainable food and nutrition security.</p>
<p>Caldwell will participate in a panel presentation on the "twin-track" approach to Green Revolution v2.0 with scheduled fellow panelists Prabu Pingali, head of agricultural policy and the statistics division of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Franck Attere, chief adviser of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Kenya; Wayne McKnight, president of McKnight Insights &amp; Solutions, and former global vice president of food procurement for Wal-Mart; and Pam Talbot, president and chief executive officer of Edelman.</p>

<p>Blumenthal spoke as part of a "Community Progress Report on the Climate Action Compact" Thursday evening in Santa Cruz. Joining him were Santa Cruz County supervisors Neal Coonerty and Mark Stone, Santa Cruz City Councilmember Emily Reilly, and county Treasurer Fred Keeley.</p>
<p>Thirteen months ago, UCSC, the city, and county pledged to reduce each institution's carbon footprint. The compact was organized and championed by Keeley, the former supervisor and state senator.</p>
<p>Keeley said the compact is just the beginning to move Santa Cruz away from the "carbon economy to a new green economy of the 21st century."</p>
<p>"Outlining our successes begins with results," Blumenthal told 100 people gathered to hear the report. "We've saved energy, saved water, cut car trips." Car trips alone are at a 10-year low, Blumenthal said, down to 1998 levels even though enrollment has grown by 50 percent.</p>
<p>Over the summer, UCSC replaced 1,100 light fixtures in student housing with energy-saving bulbs. That will save about 90,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year.</p>
<p>Since 2004, energy efficiency projects at UCSC have lowered campus C02 emissions by about 1,600 metric tons by cutting annual electricity consumption by 2.8 million kilowatt hours, according to the UCSC sustainability office. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of 293 passenger vehicles or 160 single-family homes.</p>
<p>Reilly, who was Santa Cruz mayor when the compact was signed in September 2007, commented on the increased spirit of cooperation between the community and university. "The atmosphere is different now," she said.</p>
<p>Echoing the theme, Coonerty said the city, county, and university "realized we had the same goals" and praised the historic agreement between the institutions last summer on campus plans if future growth is needed.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said, "reducing climate change and promoting sustainability are part of our core values. It's so important, I've made it one of my six campus priorities," he said.</p>
<p>A number of other efforts are under way on campus that will have far-reaching effects on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915887198072704601a012ff40b009ab"><name>2527</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Provost writes about 'opportunities and challenges'</title><summary>In the first in a series of messages, Campus Provost Kliger writes about "opportunities and challenges."</summary><keywords>kliger budget fund raising </keywords><description>In the first in a series of messages, Campus Provost Kliger writes about "opportunities and challenges."</description><start-date>1225436400000</start-date><display-name>Campus Provost writes about...</display-name><path>/2008/10/2527</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/2527</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338752178</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338752178</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The lecture halls are full and the quarter is well underway.  At this time of year, I am reminded of the excitement and possibilities each new class brings.</p><p>This is the first in a series of messages I intend to share with the campus community throughout the year. Chancellor Blumenthal - who also plans to share regular campus messages - and I are committed to broadening and strengthening our communications.  Improved understanding of our priorities, opportunities, and challenges will enrich our collective success as a campus. </p><p>To this end, my website is being redesigned and will offer an avenue for me to talk with you about the budget, academic planning, administrative decisions, and general topics related to the work of my office <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/"> (http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/)</a>.  I am actively seeking opportunities to listen more often and more effectively.  You can email my office at cpevc@ucsc.edu.  I welcome your thoughts, comments and suggestions.</p><p>This is a year of great promise for our university. This fall UCSC welcomed approximately 4,800 new students to campus; about 3,900 of these are first-year students.  In addition to being one of our most academically strong and talented frosh cohorts, this is the most ethnically diverse class of new students in UCSC's history. One-third of these students are the first from their families to attend a four-year university. </p><p>We welcome these students to a place where they will live and learn and leave prepared to be engaged global citizens. UCSC is home to world-class researchers, inspiring teachers, and committed staff members who care deeply about students and their research pursuits. This is something we can all be very proud of.</p><p>This is also a year of great challenges - today's students face enormous challenges as a generation: threats to the environment, cultural and religious conflict, and the need for new energy sources, to name a few.  Our students (and our entire community) have been witnesses to a historic national election campaign, bringing sharper focus to tensions that arise from being a part of a growing and diverse global community.  And, of course, we face economic conditions not seen since the late 1920s.</p><p>How will we nurture our promise as a world-class teaching and research university, and ensure that our students get the best of what we have to offer?</p><p> </p><p>Those of you who know me well, know that I value plain speaking.  We face some rough times and difficult choices.  It may be several years before the economy meaningfully stabilizes and rebounds.  To truly flourish in these times, we will need to hold fast to our values, be clear about our priorities, and take collective responsibility for our future through creative problem solving. I'm confident that, working in concert, we will weather these times.</p><p>There is much work ahead.  Over the next few months, the work of my office will be focused in a few key areas:</p><p>First, I am certain many of you have questions on the budget news and how that will impact your lives and your work.  While many key questions at this point have no clear answers, I promise to share what we know when we know it.  My office will provide an update next week summarizing what we know about 2008-09 UC budget, expected mid-year actions, and what that means for the campus.</p><p>As a campus, we have spent a significant amount of effort over the last several years in academic planning, resulting in a Strategic Academic Plan: <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/acadplan/docs/AcadPlan.Feb08.pdf"> http://planning.ucsc.edu/acadplan/docs/AcadPlan.Feb08.pdf</a>.  This plan reflects the work and scholarly aspirations of the faculty and our academic departments.  It identifies areas of disciplinary strength and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p>Keeping us on a path to achieve those aspirations is my top priority.  As we reduce expenses in some areas, we will also need to continue investment in others.  The academic plan can help guide those near-term investments and allow us to focus on programs for which there is growing societal need and potential for academic excellence.</p><p>   </p><p>We have also been planning the launch of a comprehensive fund-raising campaign.  Diversifying and growing our non-state funding base is essential to our long-term success. Increasing philanthropy to support student scholarships, endowed chairs, and programmatic aspirations is critical.  You will be hearing more about the campaign in coming months.</p><p>It is in challenging times that our work, our educational mission, becomes even more essential.  I am grateful for the dedication of our faculty and staff and the work that each of you does on a daily basis to keep us moving ahead.  I thank you for your support, your good counsel, and your ongoing commitment to UCSC.    </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a272e6968072704601a012fffde36bdb"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625693021</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625693021</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a272e6968072704601a012fffde36bdb"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625693021</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625693021</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
