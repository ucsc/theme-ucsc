<p>The aim of the program is to increase the numbers of financially disadvantaged students, particularly women, who earn undergraduate degrees in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering at UCSC. The program will provide need-based scholarship awards of up to $10,000 per year for two years to a cohort of eight to ten academically talented students each year.</p>
<p>The first scholarships will be awarded to students entering in fall 2009. In addition to financial support, the students will participate in an academic learning community, taking courses together and living together in a residence hall, said Adrienne Harrell, director of undergraduate student affairs at the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited about this scholarship program because it's going to provide more than just financial support. The scholarship recipients will be part of a community of peers and faculty that will help them be successful here," Harrell said.</p>
<p>Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science and associate dean for undergraduate affairs in the Baskin School of Engineering, conceived of the program and developed the proposal with several colleagues, including Tracy Larrabee and Joel Ferguson, both professors of computer engineering, and Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering. Ferguson is provost of Crown College, where the scholarship students will live.</p>
<p>One of the motivations for the program was to address the underrepresentation of women in the engineering school, McDowell said.</p>
<p>"We're hoping to use the program to attract more women and more underrepresented students in general," he said. "The scholarships create an opportunity to come to UCSC for students who might otherwise go someplace more affordable."</p>
<p>The underrepresentation of women in engineering and computer science is a national issue, and UCSC is not alone in trying to address the problem. "It's not just a balance issue," McDowell said. "We are potentially missing out on some female superstars that never find their way into computing, and we need that talent as well as the different perspectives women can bring to the field."</p>
<p>Need-based scholarships are one tool that can help the engineering school attract more women, he said. "We want to build a critical mass of women in computer science that we can use to attract even more women into the field."</p>

"It's a high-tech version of a dictionary, but it will be easier to use and better, because it won't interrupt the flow of their reading."</p><p>Scott and Yi Zhang, an assistant professor of computer science in the Technology and Information Management Program in the Baskin School of Engineering, are teaming up in an interdisciplinary collaboration to create a "dictionary for the 21st century." The U.S. Department of Education has provided a $1.5 million grant to fund the project, dubbed tecWAVE for Teaching with Computers: Word Annotation for Vocabulary Education.</p><p>The technology will be a boon to all students, but especially to struggling readers and English language learners, according to Scott. Definitions will be tailored to different reading levels, and they will be appropriate for the context, she said, adding that pictures will also pop up, making meanings even more accessible. </p><p>"A native Spanish speaker may know the Spanish word for crocodile but not recognize the English word," said Scott. "In that case, seeing the photo will really reinforce the connection between the two words."</p><p>Knowledge of vocabulary is a key element in reading achievement and overall academic success, said Scott. "By fourth grade, the number of unknown words that students encounter during the school day can be extensive," she said. "Students really need support for their vocabulary learning, because by middle school, each discipline has its own specialized vocabulary."</p><p>The tecWAVE software will use artificial-intelligence technologies to automatically generate definitions that will be appropriate in the context. Zhang, who specializes in the development of tools that manage large amounts of electronic information, has developed related applications for e-commerce but will build this tool from scratch. </p><p>Zhang and a team of graduate students will spend the next 18 months developing the technology, followed by 18 months of field testing tecWAVE in seventh-grade classrooms in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties. Laptop computers outfitted with tecWAVE software will be issued to students and teachers in each classroom. Zhang looks forward to getting feedback from young users.</p><p>"As a computer scientist, I can build the tool, but it's like medicine," she said. "Without clinical trials, we won't know for sure if it really helps kids learn vocabulary or not."</p><p>Scott predicts that tecWAVE will be embraced by students and teachers. </p><p>"It's huge to be able to bring cutting-edge technology into educational settings," said Scott. "Kids are so tech-savvy. We need to bring schools into the 21st century, and this is a big step in that direction."</p><p>In addition to Scott and Zhang, tecWAVE partners include Kelly Stack, a faculty support specialist with UCSC's Information Technology Services Faculty Instructional Technology Center, and Jack Vevea, associate professor of psychology at UC Merced. The project is also supported by UCSC's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS).</p><p>####</p><p><b>Note to journalists</b>: Scott may be reached at (831) 459-5066 or jascott@ucsc.edu; Zhang may be reached at (831) 459-4549 or yiz@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157ba448072704601a012ffe2a95b2c"><name>2391</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC plant sale kicks off fall gardening season</title><summary>UCSC's annual plant sale to take place September 12-13, 2008. </summary><author>Martha Brown, 9831) 459-3376, mtbrown@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's Fall Plant Sale, Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems</keywords><description>UCSC's annual plant sale to take place September 12-13, 2008. </description><start-date>1220425200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC plant sale kicks...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2391</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2391</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338699770</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338699770</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-3376</phone><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/09/images/plantsalesign.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/09/images/plantsalesign.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>plantsalesign.250.jpg</name><file-size>29459</file-size><width>250</width><height>251</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Plants for sale this way.

September's warm weather offers the perfect opportunity to extend the season of your vegetable and flower gardens, and to get landscape plants established before shorter days and cooler weather set in.</p>
<p>To keep your garden growing, visit the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's Fall Plant Sale, which will offer gardeners a rich and timely selection of organically raised vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives. Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale takes place on Friday and Saturday, September 12 and 13. The sale will be open from noon to 6 p.m. on Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Fall is a great time to plant fast-growing greens and other vegetable crops for late fall and winter harvest," says UCSC Garden manager Christof Bernau. This year's offerings include spinach, kale, lettuce and salad mixes, Asian greens, chard, collards, fennel, bunching onions, and leeks, along with broccoli and cabbage. Annual flowers available this year include sweet peas, bachelor buttons, statice, stock and mignonette, which can be planted in the fall for late winter and spring blooms.</p>
<p>The Farm &amp; Garden's plant sale is one of the largest all-organic events of its kind in the Monterey Bay Area. All of the flower and vegetable starts were propagated using organic methods. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides were used in growing the plants from seed. None of the hardwood cuttings were given artificial growth hormones.</p>
<p>In addition to winter vegetables and culinary herbs, the sale will feature perennial flowers and shrubs. Some favorites from this fall's collection include Echinacea purpurea, or purple coneflower; Angelica stricta purpurea, a striking purple-tinged plant much loved by butterflies; the California native Ribes sanguineum glutinosum, a drought-tolerant shrub with long, showy pink flower clusters; and Phygelius capensis, or Cape fuchsia, a snapdragon family plant whose tubular flowers attract hummingbirds. Also available will be a great selection of lavenders and salvias, including Salvia leucophylla, a California native with light purple flowers.</p>
<p>Autumn is the best time to plant perennial shrubs, including California natives, according to Bernau. "Because the soil is still warm, transplants quickly establish strong roots that ensure their survival during the winter," Bernau said. Although they'll need some initial watering, winter rains will help fall-planted perennials establish deep roots, encouraging colorful blooms and reducing water dependence next spring.</p>
<p>The sale will benefit the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening.

<p>Hibbert-Jones's project is the result of an invitation she received to participate in an international festival of art, <em>Dislocate 08</em>, exploring technology and urban experience in Yokohama and Tokyo.</p>
<p>She describes her work (in collaboration with artist Nomi Talisman) as "an emotional map of stories" collected from passengers on Japanese subways.</p>
<p>"We have just spent a week collecting stories from people traveling the Yokohama Blue Subway Line, which was recently opened here," said Hibbert-Jones in an e-mail from Japan. "These stories will be edited into an audio MP3 file that can be taken onto the subway."</p>
<p>Visitors can check out an MP3 player from a gallery in Yokohama and then travel the subway-listening in to other travelers' personal anecdotes. As they pass through each of the 32 stations, they hear a different story.</p>
<p>"We have tales for example of sparrows living underground, stories of false teeth lost and found on the subway, tales of a heart broken at a certain station, and the stories of a subway cleaning worker describing what he sees each day," said Hibbert-Jones.</p>
<p>"This creates an 'emotional mapping' of the city, allowing the listener to inhabit other travelers' relationships to places, memories and spaces," she added.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones is also creating an interactive installation at ZAIM gallery in Yohohama where visitors can touch subway stops on a large, Plexiglas table covered with drawings of the city. Touching any stop on the subway creates a video projection that describes stories that have come from that station.</p>
<p>"The goal of the exhibit is to describe a city through the thoughts, feelings, and memories of its occupants-creating an audio, as well as visual, map of experiences," she noted.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones is additionally working on a second major exhibition this summer titled "Methods of Escape." Through a series of drawings and public art works, this project explores the ways people manage emotions, struggle to feel secure, and work to escape reality--given the personal and political insecurities of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Drawings from this work are currently on exhibition at Galerie Califia in Horazd'ovice, in the Czech Republic through September.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones has also been commissioned to produce a public art exhibit of "Methods of Escape" for the FRED 08 Festival in the UK--Europe's largest festival of site-specific contemporary art, running Sept. 26 to Oct. 11 <a href="http://www.fredsblog.co.uk">FRED 08 Festival</a>.</p>
<p>"The 'Method of Escape' drawings are reminiscent in style of 1950's instructional booklets, and they will be displayed throughout the North of England," she noted. "Britons will answer the question 'What is your method of escape?'--either by responding online at <a href="http://www.secretlife.org.uk/place/escape/">Method of Escape</a> or by answering street surveys during FRED 08.</p>
<p>"I am working to translate the responses into drawings that will be exhibited on billboards, busses, phone booths, shops, tourist information centers, village notice boards, and the Manchester-Windermere railway line up and down Cumbria, UK," Hibbert-Jones added.</p>

An alternative theory that the valleys were carved by catastrophic flooding over a relatively short time is not supported by the new results.</p>
<p>Often cited as evidence that Mars once had a warm environment with liquid water on the surface, valley networks are distinctive features of the martian landscape. In the new study, researchers used sophisticated computer models to simulate the processes that formed these features.</p>
<p>"Our results argue for liquid water being stable at the surface of Mars for prolonged periods in the past," said Charles Barnhart, a graduate student in Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Barnhart conducted the study as a Graduate Student Research Program scholar at NASA Ames Research Center, working with NASA planetary scientist Jeffrey Moore and Alan Howard of the University of Virginia. A paper describing their findings has been accepted for publication in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research--Planets</em> and is currently available online.</p>
<p>"For several decades, scientists worked to determine whether or not there had ever been precipitation on Mars. Only in the last 10 years has NASA acquired high-resolution topographic data that cinched the case for massive ancient erosion from precipitation and runoff," Moore said.</p>
<p>Scientists estimate that the valley networks on Mars were carved out more than 3.5 billion years ago. Studies based on climate models have suggested that catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts could have created warm, wet conditions on Mars, causing massive deluges and flooding for periods of hundreds to thousands of years.</p>
<p>But the new study shows that those conditions would result in features not seen in the martian landscape, because water would accumulate inside craters and overflow, carving exit breaches that cut through the crater walls, Barnhart said.</p>
<p>"Our research finds that these catastrophic anomalies would be so humid and wet there would be breaching of the craters, which we don't see on Mars," he said. "The precipitation needs to be seasonal or periodic, so that there are periods of evaporation and infiltration. Otherwise the craters overflow."</p>
<p>The researchers used a landform evolution model to simulate how the surface of Mars would evolve under different climate conditions. They ran more than 70 simulations under varied conditions and performed statistical analyses to determine which yielded the best match to the observed topography of martian valleys.</p>
<p>The results suggest that valley networks formed on Mars during a semiarid to arid climate that persisted for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Episodic flooding alternated with long dry periods when water could evaporate or soak into the ground. Rainfall may have been seasonal, or wet intervals may have occurred over longer cycles. But conditions that allowed for the presence of liquid water on the surface of Mars must have lasted for at least 10,000 years, Barnhart said.</p>
<p>"Precipitation on Mars lasted a long time--it wasn't a brief interval of massive deluges," he said.</p>

<p>Called Sharps Solution, the program is administered through a county grant with help from local nonprofit environmental consultancy Ecology Action. It is free and available to students, staff, faculty, and community members. The campus pharmacy is one of about 20 pharmacies in the county participating in the program.</p>
<p>The goal of the Sharps Solution program is to improve the environment by sending fewer chemicals and sharps into sewers and landfills--and by extension, into the ocean, said Diane Lamotte, PRh, ancillary services coordinator for the Cowell Student Health Center.</p>
<p>Before disposal programs such as Sharps Solution, patients often threw old medications and sharps in the trash or flushed them down the toilet, said Lamotte.</p>
<p>News reports earlier this year uncovered the presence of tiny concentrations of a vast array of pharmaceuticals in drinking water supplies across the nation. Water utilities insisted their water was safe, but scientists worried about the long-term health consequences of the discovery.</p>
<p>"It's not just that disposing of them properly is the right thing to do, but you realize there are hormones and other medications out there and in our drinking water," Lamotte said.</p>
<p>The program also aims to also improve safety at home, especially for children, pets, and the elderly.</p>
<p>"It's an excellent public service," Lamotte said. "Often people would bring these items to pharmacies, and we weren't allowed to accept them before."</p>
<p>She sees it as a potentially valuable service especially for faculty and staff, who may have been accumulating things or have had a loved one pass away or experience a significant change in health.</p>
<p>The collected waste will be properly disposed of by environmental consulting firm Advanced Waste Solutions.</p>
<p>Facts to know about disposing of waste with Sharps Solution:</p>
<p><strong>Medications</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Medications will need to be checked by a pharmacist prior to disposal.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>They should be in the original bottles with the medication name visible (the patient name can be marked out).<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Controlled substances are not allowed.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Items accepted include prescription, over-the-counter, and pet medication; medication samples; vitamins; medicated ointments, creams, and lotions; inhalers; and liquid medications in leak-proof containers.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Items not accepted include controlled substances (narcotics), personal care products, aerosol cans, bloody or infectious waste, thermometers, IV bags, hydrogen peroxide, and empty containers.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Sharps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sharps are needles, pen needles, lancets, broken medication glass such as ampoules, scalpels, and suture needles.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A new law states that as of Sept. 1, 2008, all sharps must be disposed of in approved sharps containers.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Sharps containers are available for purchase at pharmacies. The program offers $3-off coupons toward the purchase of a sharps container, available at the pharmacy. The UCSC SHC Pharmacy sells the containers for $3, so they're free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given in support of a wide range of campus activities, the private support included $8.5 million toward ongoing research in marine science from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.</p>
<p>UCSC is on the forefront of marine science research and education. Set on the edge of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the nation's largest marine sanctuary, the campus provides students and scientists who seek to study the ocean and its life a unique opportunity to pursue their dreams and ambitions.</p>
<p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's support included a four-year, $3.7 million grant awarded in June to Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC. The grant funds Zehr's ongoing research as a Moore Foundation Investigator in Marine Science. Earlier in the year, the foundation provided a $4.8 million award for the marine microbiology research facility that Zehr oversees. Both grants are renewals of earlier awards made as part of the Moore Foundation's Marine Microbiology Initiative, which aims to discover important new knowledge about the distribution, function, and ecological role of marine microbes.</p>
<p>Other donations in the year that ended June 30 supported UCSC's innovative health sciences major and the expansion of McHenry Library, and funded scholarships that open the door to promising students in need of financial assistance.</p>
<p>"Every gift enhances our ability to educate students who, side by side with our faculty, are seeking solutions to the challenges facing the world," said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George R. Blumenthal. "We are enormously grateful to our many donors for supporting our academic initiatives and service to our community."</p>
<p>One such challenge is the lack of health care available in many of California's emerging communities. At UCSC, health sciences students pursuing careers in medicine or biomedical research are encouraged to use their education to provide health care for those who need it most. UCSC's undergraduate major in health sciences requires that students become proficient in Spanish and participate in a community-oriented internship program.</p>
<p>The program is one of the fastest-growing majors on campus and among the 10 most popular majors at UCSC despite only being established in 2003.</p>

<p>To further encourage UCSC's medical school-bound alumni to provide health care to California's underserved populations, two local health-care organizations-Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center and Central Coast Alliance for Health-sponsored the Primary Care Physician Award. Providing students with $10,000 scholarships, the award supports graduates of the health sciences program who plan to focus on primary-care medicine and intend to practice medicine on the Central Coast after completing medical school.</p>
<p>UCSC donors supporting McHenry Library provided $4.8 million toward the library's renovation and doubled the size of the library's special collections with a gift from musical icons the Grateful Dead. In May, the library was awarded a $700,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation toward construction and modernization. In order to receive the funds, the library must raise $3.5 million by October 1, 2009.</p>
<p>UCSC donors also established endowed funds in honor of faculty members J. Casey Moore and the late Stanley FlattÃÂ©. And donors endowed the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society Fund, which provides scholarships and other support to undergraduate students without families of their own.</p>
<p>Annual Giving programs at UCSC raised $2.37 million, including $560,000 from alumni and $447,000 from parents.</p>

<p>DeRisi, 38, earned his B.A. in biochemistry and molecular biology from UCSC in 1992 and is now a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of biochemistry at UCSF. One of the world's foremost researchers in the application of molecular genomics to the study of infectious disease, he is among five distinguished Americans selected to receive one of the $250,000 awards, presented by the Heinz Family Foundation.</p>
<p>"Joe DeRisi ennobles the field of science not only by way of his pioneering advancements in the laboratory but by virtue of the altruistic and caring nature with which he carries out his work," said Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz Family Foundation. "As a scientist, Dr. DeRisi has made breakthrough discoveries that have provided clarity and insight into the detection of some of the world's most threatening viruses, and his work in finding a cure for malaria offers hope to the hundreds of millions of people afflicted annually by the disease. As a humanitarian, he has distinguished himself as a generous and tireless advocate for the free and open sharing of scientific research. With a brilliant mind and expansive heart, Dr. Joseph DeRisi is a truly deserving recipient of this year's Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment."</p>

UCSC honored DeRisi in 2006 with the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/12-04/achievement.asp">Alumni Achievement Award</a> (view a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/alumni_friends/awards/06-07/derisi.mov">video of his acceptance</a>). In 2004, he received a <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/10-04/derisi.asp">MacArthur Foundation Fellowship</a>, a $500,000 award often called a "genius grant."<br/>
<br/>
<p>DeRisi stands at the intersection of the disciplines driving the life sciences--genomics, bioinformatics, virology, materials science, and computer engineering. Together with his longtime colleague, Don Ganem, DeRisi pioneered the development and use of the ViroChip, a band-aid-sized glass wafer that contains a microarray of 22,000 DNA sequences from more than 1,300 viral families. This "diagnostics on a chip" enables scientists to not only quickly and accurately identify existing viruses, but also to detect new viruses that could emerge as pandemic threats. In 2003, the ViroChip identified the SARS virus within 24 hours of receiving the sample from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Befitting his commitment to open-access publishing within the scientific arena, DeRisi has not pursued a patent for the ViroChip, allowing researchers around the world to use the invention for free. He also has employed the ViroChip toward unlocking other discoveries, including a novel retrovirus in patients with a rare type of prostate cancer and a new subfamily of respiratory viruses. Most recently, DeRisi and his team have used the ViroChip to isolate a new virus associated with proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), a fatal disease of endangered and exotic birds.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his work in virus detection, DeRisi's primary focus has been on finding a cure for malaria, a disease that infects up to 500 million people annually, killing between 700,000 and 2.7 million, mostly children. DeRisi and his team developed a malaria-specific DNA chip, similar to the ViroChip, that enabled them to characterize the parasite's distinctive 48-hour life cycle, a breakthrough that could pave the way for potential drug and vaccine therapy. As part of DeRisi's open-access approach to science and technology, the software his team developed to analyze and generate DNA chips is freely available from his web site.</p>
<p>As part of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, a cooperative effort among three UC campuses and private industry, DeRisi's laboratory is working to apply the quantitative sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering) to biosciences toward improving human health. He also has taken on a number of other challenges, from investigating a cure for the common cold to an analysis of the colony collapse disorder affecting a half-million honeybee colonies in the United States, a situation that could have a viral culprit at its roots.</p>
<p>"Rapid advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics have enabled us to examine the nature of infectious diseases and the microbial world that surrounds us at a resolution that was once unimaginable," DeRisi said. "While I have been fortunate to participate in this field, the most exciting discoveries, diagnostic developments and, ultimately, cures are yet to come. My thanks go out to the Heinz Family Foundation for recognizing me--and by extension my many colleagues, students and post-docs over the years--with this tremendous honor."</p>
<p>Since 1993, the Heinz Family Foundation of Pittsburgh has recognized individuals whose dedication, skill and generosity of spirit represent the best of the human qualities that the late Senator Heinz, for whom the award is named, held so dear.</p>
<p>Presented in five categories, the other Heinz Award recipients are:</p>
<p><strong>Arts and Humanities: Ann Hamilton</strong>, 52, visual artist and educator, from Columbus, Ohio</p>
<p><strong>Environment: Thomas FitzGerald</strong>, 53, founder and director of the Kentucky Resources Council, from Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p><strong>Human Condition: Brenda Krause Eheart</strong>, Ph.D., 64, founder of Generations of Hope and Hope Meadows, from Champaign, Ill.</p>
<p><strong>Public Policy: Robert Greenstein</strong>, 62, founder and executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, from Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>In addition to the $250,000 award for their unrestricted use, recipients are presented with a medallion inscribed with the image of Senator Heinz on one side and a rendering of a globe passing between two hands on the other. The medallion symbolizes the partnership, continuity and values carried on to the next generation. The hands also suggest passing on the stewardship of the earth to future generations.</p>
<p>The Heinz Awards will be presented at a private ceremony in Pittsburgh on October 21. Additional information is available online at <a href="http://www.heinzawards.net">www.heinzawards.net</a>.</p>

"Our students continue to receive instruction from faculty who are supported to work on the most cutting-edge problems with the very best equipment and facilities; our faculty not only maintain their international standing, but attract new peers to the campus from the very best pool of talent; and the community benefits from $131 million of additional business activity that is green, high-tech, and spins off well-paid jobs."</p><p>The single largest award, $29.6 million, was received for projects carried out by the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) located at NASA Ames Research Center. This award made NASA the largest funding source ($36.7 million), followed by the National Science Foundation ($21.3 million) and the National Institutes of Health ($20.5 million). </p><p>UCSC's continued success in attracting research funding has brought in more than half a billion dollars over the past five years.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157c9518072704601a012fff93b3121"><name>2402</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mr. President . . .</title><start-date>1220943600000</start-date><display-name>Mr. President . ....</display-name><path>/2008/09/2402</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2402</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338703632</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338703632</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If you could advise the next president of the United States, what would you say?

Fairlie and coauthor Alicia M. Robb, a research associate in economics at UCSC, conclude that the lack of startup money for black businesses and the lack of prebusiness work experience severely hamper African American entrepreneurial success.</p><p>"Nearly half of all black families have less than $6,000 in total wealth, so the lack of capital is a huge impediment," said Fairlie. "And it's a catch-22, because without black-owned businesses, family members can't get the experience that turns out to be a vital factor in business survival and performance." </p><p>Entrepreneurs who work in a family business before starting their own company have business outcomes that are 10 to 40 percent better than those who lack that experience, said Fairlie. The authors used both business longevity and performance to determine business outcomes.</p><p>Other highlights of <i>Race and Entrepreneurial Success</i> include:</p><p>. Black business ownership rates are 45 percent of white rates, and average sales among black-owned firms are one-sixth white levels. (White-owned firms have average sales of $440,000, compared to only $75,000 for black-owned firms.)</p><p>. Racial patterns in business outcomes have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades.</p><p>. A 10 percent increase in both the number of minority-owned firms and the average number of employees per firm would create nearly 1 million new jobs for minorities and an additional 1 million more jobs for nonminorities.</p><p>. About one in 10 workers in the Unites States owns a business, yet business owners hold nearly 40 percent of total wealth in this country.</p><p>"The concentration of wealth among entrepreneurs underscores the social value of targeted policy initiatives designed to open the door to business ownership for more minorities," said Fairlie. One of the goals of government programs that promote minority-owned businesses is to reduce wealth inequality, he noted.</p><p>Fairlie suggests the creation of programs that would: </p><p> . Promote educational attainment to overcome disparities between Asians and black business owners (Asian business owners are twice as likely to have a college degree as are black business owners);</p><p>. Provide mentoring, internships, or apprenticeship-type training to help would-be business owners acquire necessary and relevant skills, as a substitute for the lack of opportunities to work in a family business.</p><p>"An added benefit of these initiatives is that they would improve business performance for all entrepreneurs, not just those from minority groups," noted Fairlie. </p><p></p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to reporters</b>: Fairlie may be reached at rfairlie@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-3332.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157cbc28072704601a012ff562b839f"><name>2404</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Union Assembly wants to get out the vote</title><summary>The Student Union Assembly (SUA), together with a coalition of other organizations, has embarked upon its annual voter registration drive. </summary><author>VÃ­ctor George SÃ¡nchez Jr., Vice Chair of External Affairs, Student Union Assembly , (831) 459-4838</author><description>The Student Union Assembly (SUA), together with a coalition of other organizations, has embarked upon its annual voter registration drive. </description><start-date>1221116400000</start-date><display-name>Student Union Assembly wants...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2404</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2404</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338704274</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338704274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Opinion</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Student Union Assembly (SUA), together with a coalition of other organizations, has embarked upon its annual voter registration drive. This year the project aims to register 4,200 new students to vote in the November 4 general election. The movement is part of a bigger systemwide project. In an effort to increase the power of young adults, we have joined forces with students from across the state and country through the University of California Students Association (UCSA) and the United States Students Association (USSA) in this nonpartisan effort to increase student electoral participation.</p><p>Systemwide, we have already registered 13,000 students to vote and are looking to add 32,000 more for November. </p><p>UC Santa Cruz and campuses across the country are suffering from decreased investment in higher education from the state and federal government. Tuition has skyrocketed, faculty salaries have remained stagnant, and student loans and grants no longer serve the needs of students. As students, we know that in order to have our voices heard in regard to higher education, we must vote. One of the most effective ways we can make a difference is to register students and faculty, provide voter education, and increase voter turnout. </p><p>The deadline to register for the November election is October 20. For more information on where to obtain voter registration cards, please contact the Student Union Assembly Office on the second floor of the Student Union at (831) 459-4838.</p><p>VÃ­ctor George SÃ¡nchez Jr.</p><p>Vice Chair of External Affairs</p><p>Student Union Assembly (SUA)</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157cd178072704601a012ffc529fffc"><name>2405</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Catch UCSC prof's awardwinning film on PBS this month</title><summary>The film &lt;i&gt;Calavera Highway&lt;/i&gt;, an award-winning saga of a Mexican American family, debuts on public television this month.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><description>The film &lt;i&gt;Calavera Highway&lt;/i&gt;, an award-winning saga of a Mexican American family, debuts on public television this month.</description><start-date>1221721200000</start-date><display-name>Catch UCSC prof's awardwinning...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2405</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2405</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338704612</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338704612</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/09/images/pena.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/09/images/pena.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pena.jpg</name><file-size>8374</file-size><width>150</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Director Renee Tajima-Pena.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The film <i>Calavera Highway</i>, an award-winning saga of a Mexican American family, debuts on public television this month.</p><p>The feature-length documentary by director Renee Tajima-PeÃ±a, an associate professor of community studies, tells the story of seven brothers grappling with troubling questions about their family's past following the death of their mother.</p><p><i>Calavera Highway</i> ("Skeleton" Highway) follows the filmmaker's husband Armando and his brother Carlos as they carry their mother's ashes back to South Texas and reunite with their far-flung brothers.

I had to be a little bit different," said a smiling Trevor, who plans to major in bioinformatics; each of his siblings earned bachelor's degrees in biochemistry and molecular biology. </p><p>"For me, it was almost a challenge," said Trevor. "Because everyone else had done it, I didn't want to be the one who failed." </p><p>Although Trevor's mother, Mersi Sughrue, jokes that it "must be the supplements I put in their milk," there's definitely something about the Sughrue family that produces top students who head to--and thrive at--UCSC. Eldest son Gideon graduated in 1999, followed by Wesley in 2003, and Kaila in 2007. Gideon just completed his medical residency in San Francisco, while Wesley is a doctoral candidate in biochemistry at UC Davis, and Kaila is in veterinary school, also at UC Davis. </p><p>Trevor credits now-retired Harbor High School science teacher Nick Bilardello with igniting a passion for biology in all his siblings. "Pretty much everyone in my family had an interest in biology," said Trevor, who graduated with a 4.38 grade point average and earned top grades on the advanced placement tests in biology and calculus, as well as near-perfect scores on the AP tests in European history and English. </p><p>Although he spent an average of four hours a day studying, while also pursuing piano, karate, and soccer, Trevor said science "has always been there. The light bulb has always been on."</p><p>On his siblings' advice, Trevor chose Cowell College ("they liked the location and said it has the best view and the most interesting core class"). He plans to save money by living at home, but he'll have ready-made bases on campus, because four of his buddies are also enrolling at UCSC this fall, three of whom will live on campus. His academic achievement helped him win several scholarships, which will also keep the cost of college down. </p><p>Trevor's brother Gideon, the unwitting trendsetter in the family, liked how approachable UCSC professors were and said biochemistry proved a valuable foundation for medical school, while Wesley chose UCSC in part because undergraduates have so many opportunities to participate in research. The 18 months he spent working alongside world-class researchers in a UCSC biophysics lab confirmed his interest in--and talent for--scientific exploration.</p><p>Trevor's sister, Kaila, calls her brother's enrollment at UCSC a "clean sweep for the family" and says she can't wait to get back to Santa Cruz after finishing vet school. UCSC gave her a "very solid base" on which to build her career, she said.</p><p>All four kids grew up familiar with the campus; their father, John, has been a groundskeeper for more than 20 years. Trevor was so determined to go to UCSC that he didn't apply to any other schools, a decision his parents supported. "It's a great school. It's about the science opportunities at UCSC," said Mersi Sughrue. "Why would we need to go any place else?"</p><p>The concentration of scientists in the family doesn't faze parents Mersi and John Sughrue, who majored in dance and English, respectively. "There have always been lively dinner-table conversations about science, and Trevor always listened," recalled Mersi Sughrue. "He's smart. He can't help himself."</p><p>Asked if family expectations played a role in the success of her children, Mersi Sughrue said, "All we ever asked was that they did their personal best." Gideon, their first son, set a good example with a strong work ethic, and the rest "fell into place. It never was a struggle, really."</p><p>"They're all really wonderful kids," she added. "They're going to make great contributions to the world. We couldn't be prouder." </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157cfcc8072704601a012ff0dad3c80"><name>2407</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Slug tennis nets awards</title><summary>Slug tennis received team and player awards when the Intercollegiate Tennis Association announced its 2008 ITA All-Academic Teams and Scholar-Athletes.</summary><description>Slug tennis received team and player awards when the Intercollegiate Tennis Association announced its 2008 ITA All-Academic Teams and Scholar-Athletes.</description><start-date>1221462000000</start-date><display-name>Slug tennis nets awards...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2407</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2407</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338705308</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338705308</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Intercollegiate Tennis Association has announced its 2008 ITA All-Academic Teams and Scholar-Athletes.</p>

So tiny she would've fit in the palm of his hand, baby Dilia was kept in isolation and wouldn't know her brother's touch for two months.</p>
<p>Today, Dilia is a happy 9-year-old, with few traces of those trying months, and Martinez credits her with shaping his own life. "Seeing the struggle my sister went through just to be alive was not just inspiring, but a driving force today," he said. "That's when I decided I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to know what was going on with her."</p>
<p>A senior at UCSC, Martinez is majoring in <a href="http://www.biology.ucsc.edu/healthsci/">health sciences</a> and <a and="" community="" first="" for="" href="http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/%3Ecommunity%20studies%3C/a%3E%20on%20his%20way%20to%20earning%20an%20M.D.%20and%20a%20master's%20in%20public%20health.%20%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E" in="" is="" medicine="" participate="" prestigious="" said="" selected="selected" student="" the="" to="" ucsc="" who="" work=""></a><a href="http://www.kff.org/minorityhealth/bjscholars/index.cfm">Barbara Jordan Health Policy Scholars Program</a> in Washington, D.C. One of only 15 scholars chosen from 350 applicants, Martinez spent 10 weeks this spring and summer learning about health policy, particularly issues that affect minorities and underserved communities. The program is supported by the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<p>"It's one of the most amazing, life-changing opportunities I've ever had," said Martinez, who worked side-by-side with legislative assistants in the office of <a href="%20http://solis.house.gov/">Congresswoman Hilda Solis</a> (D-El Monte). He wrote memos, drafted a speech for Solis, attended a historic Congressional hearing on health disparities convened by Solis, and got an incredible overview of the legislative system.</p>
<p>"What I really understand now is that policy is the background work to how our entire health care system works," said Martinez. "I had the privilege of gaining a broader perspective."</p>
<p>As part of the fellowship, Martinez drafted a policy memo on living with HIV/AIDS that focused on improving services for people in the Los Angeles area. "You don't just talk about one thing. You have to think about costs, effectiveness, the needs of underserved and vulnerable populations," he said. "You don't just think in one dimension."</p>
<p>The truth is that racial and ethnic health disparities aren't a priority for a lot of legislators, he said. "But one of the impacts of this program is that we bring these perspectives from our communities to Congressional staffers and legislators who may not yet be playing a role in these areas," said Martinez, who recalled stepping inside the Capitol for the first time and asking himself, "How did I end up here?"</p>
<p>He will remain in the nation's capital through December as an intern with Mary's Center for Maternal &amp; Child Care as he completes the field-study requirement of his community studies program.</p>
<p>Martinez grew up playing soccer, baseball, and basketball, but school wasn't a priority. "I barely got through second through sixth grade," he recalled. His parents, who had immigrated to the United States from Mexico as children, had never attended college, and they wanted more for their children. They chose an unusual avenue for Martinez: They sent him to the city pool to play water polo.</p>
<p>"It went from a hobby to being my life--I stopped going out with friends because I was always at the pool. It's where I learned discipline, teamwork, and working with other people," he said. "It pulled me away from the street environment I could've fallen into. I found another way to release my energy."</p>
<p>Martinez liked the intensity of water polo, which challenged his physical capabilities, and it also opened new doors. He enrolled at Cathedral High School in downtown Los Angeles, one of the few schools that offered the sport, and he joined an elite club team, the City of Commerce Aquatics, that competed nationally.</p>
<p>Competing on all-Latino teams in the white-dominated sport also exposed Martinez to racism for the first time. "It ticked people off to lose to a team like ours," he said.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Martinez was the only nonwhite player on the water polo team, but playing college water polo was a dream, he said. The Slugs won the Division Three national championship during his third year, and last fall, he wrapped up his fourth and final year with the team.</p>
<p>"I had the largest culture shock when I came to this city," recalled Martinez, who said the campus looked to him like a farm. He missed his family, his neighborhood, and he missed speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>Martinez enrolled in pre-med classes but found his footing through friends and by taking classes in Latin American and Latino studies, getting involved with Chicano Teatro, Chicanos/Latinos for Health Education (CHE), and MEChA, the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan, the Chicano student organization.</p>
<p>A double major in health sciences and community studies rounded out his academic program, and faculty mentors reinforced his commitment to serving others. "The thing that drives me the most is my family," he said. "I'm not just doing this for myself. I'm doing it for people back home. If I can do it, anybody else can, too."</p>

The report was discouraging, but Toma is committed to the fight for racial equality and social justice. He draws inspiration from the courage of those who are committed to breaking the cycles of stereotyping, violence, and retribution. </p><p>"What keeps me hopeful is the work I do with members of the community, like the mothers of those who have been killed at the hands of hate," said Toma. "When they stand up and call for peace, and call for us to come together to address the root causes of the violence, those experiences remind me of our potential to go beyond what we are, and not allow ourselves to be drawn into the pettiness of rivalries and revenge."</p><p>And he credits UCSC with shaping his life's work as a global citizen and an advocate for change, greater equality, and social justice.</p><p>"I look at UCSC as being a pivotal experience in my life," said Toma. "In many ways, it made me the person I am today. It opened up this whole world of possibilities."</p><p>Toma recalled studying the Russian Revolution with the late Oakes College professor Roberto Crespi, learning about Middle East politics with economist Alan Richards, and becoming fluent in Spanish with the help of Frank "Paco" Ramirez and others. His list of influential professors includes sociologists James O'Connor, William Friedland, and Wally Goldfrank, as well as the late economist Richard Gordon, whose course on England's transition from feudalism to capitalism remains vivid.</p><p>Through the UC Education Abroad Program, Toma spent his junior year in Barcelona, a "life-changing experience" during which he became fluent in Spanish and met people from across Europe who were standing up to injustice.</p><p>"I really do feel the values of social justice and equality I gained at Santa Cruz have guided me in my decisions," said Toma. </p><p>After college and a stint as a public school teacher, Toma earned a master's in urban planning and a law degree from UCLA. As a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Toma first encountered Japanese Latin Americans who had been forcibly brought to the United States and imprisoned by the U.S. government during World War II. Toma, who is Japanese American, played an instrumental role in a class action lawsuit and a political campaign for redress for more than 2,200 of the former internees. He helped win a settlement that included an apology and payment to the plaintiffs.</p><p>"Urban planning allows you to look at the broad causes of social ills, and the law is a specific tool," he said. "The courts can be a place to ensure that people can have their human rights respected."</p><p>In 1994, Toma was selected to participate in the prestigious three-year Kellogg National Fellowship Program created to nurture the next generation of leaders. He traveled the country and the globe to study how societies treat their newcomers and one another. From Indonesia and China to Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the Caribbean, Toma looked for successful strategies that help build political and economic democracies in culturally diverse, pluralistic societies.</p><p>"I learned that what we were experiencing in the United States in terms of creating a more inclusive society was far ahead of what other communities were just beginning to experience," recalled Toma. "Europe was just beginning to experience the cultural diversity of global migration. But even in China, I saw the incredible human capacity to divide and discriminate, and I realized the definition of an outsider doesn't depend on ethnicity."</p><p>In 1995, during the fellowship, Toma was hired by the commission. He was appointed executive director by the LA County Board of Supervisors in 2000.</p><p>"I've made my decisions in life based on whether I feel good about what I'm doing every day," said Toma. "I didn't think I'd be at the County more than a few years, but I found a unique place where we can use the power of government to do what my time at UCSC inspired me to do, which is to dedicate myself to working for urgently needed social change."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157db558072704601a012ff453c7133"><name>2415</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor provides progress report at Partners in Community event</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz achieved a number of significant milestones during the &#13;

(Photos by Terry Way)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz achieved a number of significant milestones during the last academic year and is poised to continue that progress in the coming year, Chancellor George Blumenthal reported at the second annual Partners in Community event, held last week at the Music Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Attended by approximately 250 people, the event is designed to provide members of UCSC's 14 Friends groups and other invited members of the Santa Cruz community with an opportunity to hear Chancellor Blumenthal review highlights from the prior year and preview the year ahead. Audience members also get a chance to ask questions of Blumenthal and other members of the campus's Leadership Team.</p>
<p>Blumenthal began his remarks last Thursday by discussing the "landmark agreement" between UCSC, the City and County of Santa Cruz, and citizens groups--reached after many months of mediated discussions about the campus's Long Range Development Plan.</p>
<p>The agreement ends litigation related to the LRDP, enabling the campus to advance its academic plan and develop facilities that meet the educational needs of students and the state. The settlement agreement includes mutually enforceable measures to address traffic impacts, conserve water, and provide housing for new</p>
<p>students.</p>
<p>The campus had already taken steps toward reducing traffic and water use, said Blumenthal. "Car trips are down to the same level they were in 1998, even though the campus has grown 50 percent since then," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>The campus has also cut its water use by 40 percent since the 1980s, he said, "and we're going to do better."</p>
<p>The past year was filled with academic and research achievements, Blumenthal said, citing the following as examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faculty achieved national distinction. For example, Claire Max, <br/>
<br/>
<p>professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was elected to the National</p>
<p>Academy of Sciences; seismologist Thorne Lay was elected to the American</p>
<p>Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>

</li>
<li>Researchers have made major strides in their fields. For example, a <br/>
<br/>
<p>microchip developed by engineer Wentai Liu is helping restore vision to</p>
<p>the blind, and UCSC scientists were involved in the startup of a massive</p>
<p>new atom smasher in Europe this summer. "These examples remind us how</p>
<p>research makes a real difference for humanity and the quality of life on</p>
<p>our planet," said Blumenthal.</p>

</li>
<li>The SAT scores and the grade point averages of incoming freshmen <br/>
<br/>
<p>continue to rise, and the campus is becoming more selective. The student</p>
<p>body is also increasingly diverse.</p>

</li>
<li>Private support for the campus topped $31.5 million (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2398">related story</a>). "This is a serious and important achievement for this campus at a time when we <br/>
<br/>
<p>really need it," Blumenthal said. Contracts and grants to the campus</p>
<p>totaled $131 million (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2401">related story</a>).</p>

</li>
<li>In construction news, the chancellor noted that McHenry Library is under renovation, the Digital Arts New Media building is progressing, and the California Coastal Commission approved plans last academic year to expand Long Marine Lab.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Blumenthal went on to briefly discuss partnerships in Silicon Valley, various environmental initiatives, the conclusion of a successful Shakespeare Santa Cruz season, and the loss in the state Legislature of Assemblyman John Laird, an alum and UC Santa Cruz ally who is being termed out of office at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Mayor Ryan Coonerty, who is also a lecturer on campus, addressed the audience after Blumenthal, calling the settlement agreement on the LRDP "an opportunity to revitalize and revamp the relationship between the city and the university."</p>
<p>Audience members then asked questions of the chancellor, querying him on topics such as how UCSC supports local businesses and how the campus can improve access for visitors.</p>
<p>At a reception afterward, Richard Zscheile of Aptos, a member of the Lifelong Learners group, described the event as positive, adding that it's helpful to receive updates on what's happening on campus and what the plans are. "A lot of people in town don't know what's going on up here," he added.</p>
<p>For research professor and Santa Cruz resident Frank "Bud" Bridges, a member of the Emeriti Group, the chancellor's report "laid out some of the plans very well and kept us in touch."</p>
<p>Professor of Chemistry Todd Wipke, of Santa Cruz, was especially pleased to see Shakespeare Santa Cruz get some attention, calling the theater group a "gem that attracts a lot of people to campus and is underutilized."</p>

The first day of instruction in the fall quarter is Thursday, September 25. The fall-quarter "move-in" for students living on campus is scheduled to continue through Sunday, September 21.</p><p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's new students, new programs the campus is offering, and new buildings that are under construction.</p><p><b>2008-09 Enrollment:</b></p><p>On-campus enrollment during the 2008-09 academic year is expected to average 15,425 over the fall, winter, and spring quarters. In addition, UCSC expects to enroll another 300 FTE students in off-campus venues, such as the Education Abroad Program, the UC-DC program in Washington, D.C., and in studies at the Silicon Valley Center. Of the 15,725 students expected to enroll this next academic year, 14,255 will be undergraduates; 1,470 are projected to enroll in graduate studies. During the course of the year, approximately 4,870 new undergraduate students (3,850 freshmen and 1,070 transfer students) are expected to enroll. For fall quarter, the new undergraduates were admitted from among approximately 33,137 applicants to UCSC (27,842 applications from prospective freshmen; 5,295, from prospective transfer students.)</p><p><b>Freshman Class:</b></p><p>UCSC's new freshman class, which is projected to include about 3,850 students, will be the most diverse entering class ever. UC Santa Cruz saw increases in all underrepresented ethnicities in this year's freshmen. Almost one-quarter (22.9 percent) of the incoming freshmen this fall identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, or American Indian, and another quarter (24.7 percent) identified themselves as Asian/Asian American. Nearly one-third of incoming freshman will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of the freshmen have proposed a major on their application, while about 30 percent are joining the campus as "undeclared/undecided." The most popular majors among the incoming freshmen include biology (246 students), business management economics (239 students), and psychology (281 students). Another 287 students are expected to enroll in engineering majors. More than 600 students (607) have proposed a major in the many subjects relating to biological sciences. </p><p>The average grade-point average (G.P.A.) of admitted freshmen this fall is 3.70.</p><p>About 31 percent of new freshmen come from the Bay Area/Northern California, while another 35 percent come from Southern California. Nearly 99 percent of the incoming freshmen will be living on campus.</p><p><b>Transfer Students:</b></p><p>The new students projected to enroll at UCSC this year include 1,070 transfer students. Approximately 20 percent of the expected transfer students are from underrepresented ethnicities, up slightly from last year. Also expected to show a slight increase is the percentage of transfer students (12.8 percent) identifying themselves as Asian/Asian American.</p><p>Popular majors for transfer students who have selected a major on their application include psychology, the biological sciences, and literature. Average G.P.A. of admitted transfer students this fall is 3.30.</p><p>About 91 percent of incoming transfer students are from the California community colleges, also an increase over last year. Students from Cabrillo College are expected to total approximately 151, comprising more than 17 percent of all incoming transfers. About 36 percent of transfers are from the Bay Area/Northern California and 33 percent from Southern California.</p><p><b>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</b></p><p>UCSC is offering two new minors: the Baskin School of Engineering has created a minor in Applied Mathematics, and the Sociology Department has created a minor in Global Information and Social Enterprise Studies.</p><p>In addition, the School of Engineering has added several new academic concentrations within the undergraduate majors of bioengineering and electrical engineering.</p><p><b>New Buildings/Other Construction Projects:</b></p><p>A number of construction projects will continue through part or all of the 2008-09 academic year. The projects include:</p><p>McHenry Library Expansion: After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project took a giant step toward reality as construction began three years ago. The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will provide increased space to better serve library users. The project, scheduled for completion in 2009, will provide the campus with an outstanding, architecturally designed building in a setting of terraced reading gardens, redwoods, and cherry trees.</p><p>Digital Arts Building: Work is ongoing, and the building is scheduled for completion in fall 2009. Located near the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center, the state-funded $25 million arts building is slated to house the expanding digital arts program as well as to provide 10 studios for art faculty, a photography studio, and expanded space for music and theater arts classes.</p><p>Ranch View Terrace: Construction work continues on the Ranch View Terrace project, which will provide 45 single-family homes in its first phase. The three- and four-bedroom homes will be located in the southern section of campus, adjacent to the Arboretum, and south of the Farm and Garden. The site has the capacity to include an additional 39 homes in subsequent phases. The first units are expected to be available for occupancy in the fall of 2008.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157e2918072704601a012fff0ea0f63"><name>2419</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grant provides funds for high-throughput DNA sequencer</title><summary>UCSC scientists will be able to sequence DNA using next-generation high-throughput instrumentation, thanks to new funding from the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences.</summary><author>Branwyn Wagman (831) 459-3077; bwagman@soe.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Genome Sequencing Center, Nader Pourmand</keywords><description>UCSC scientists will be able to sequence DNA using next-generation high-throughput instrumentation, thanks to new funding from the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences.</description><start-date>1221634800000</start-date><display-name>Grant provides funds for...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2419</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2419</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338710068</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338710068</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Branwyn Wagman</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-3077</phone><email>bwagman@soe.ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/09/images/gsc_crop_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/09/images/gsc_crop_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gsc_crop_300.jpg</name><file-size>71793</file-size><width>300</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Senior sequencing associate Eveline Farias-Hesson and assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Nader Pourmand with new DNA sequencing equipment in the UCSC Genome Sequencing Center.

The DNA sequencing equipment, available at the end of September, augments campus research capabilities and allows faculty, students, and research staff from several departments to undertake innovative projects and training activities.</p>
<p>The new equipment will reside in the recently established UCSC Genome Sequencing Center (GSC). Nader Pourmand, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, spearheaded the equipment acquisition and the establishment of the GSC.</p>
<p>"A sequencing center at UCSC will facilitate collaborations that are likely to produce fundamental discoveries in microbial research with strong implications for biotechnology and drug target discovery," Pourmand said.</p>
<p>Departments expected to benefit from the new sequencing center and its state-of-the-art equipment include Biomolecular Engineering; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Studies; Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; Ocean Sciences; and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.</p>
<p>"The GSC will foster interdisciplinary research in genomics, bioinformatics, and environmental biology and will open up extraordinary opportunities for research, teaching, and training in academic programs across campus," Pourmand said. "Essentially any program that uses genetic analysis can benefit from the instrumentation and technologies that will be available through the GSC."</p>
<p>Faculty at QB3 partner campuses UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco will also have access to the equipment.</p>
<p>Pourmand's laboratory focuses on technology development for biomedical research. He undertook the establishment of the Genome Sequencing Center as a contribution to the campus. The center is part of a concerted effort at UCSC to enhance research capabilities on campus and improve DNA sequencing methods and technologies.</p>
<p>Researchers at UCSC are working to advance DNA sequencing technology and plan to develop critical technology for use in the GSC. For example, work in the center will include automating what is currently a complicated sample preparation process and increasing the length of DNA segments that can be read at one time. Increasing the "read length" will make it easier to assemble genomes.</p>
<p>"The current standard is 35 base pairs, and we want to improve it," Pourmand said.</p>
<p>UCSC experts will develop computer algorithms necessary for assembling, analyzing, and visualizing the genomic data generated from the new sequencing technologies. The GSC is also expected to augment development on campus of genome and microbial browsers, single-cell sequencing technologies, and nanopore sequencing techniques using electrophoresis.</p>
<p>The California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) is a multidisciplinary research institute designed to accelerate discovery and innovation that benefit society. The institute involves more than 180 scientists at UCSF, UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research is an interdisciplinary research institute at UCSC. STEPS fosters research and policy efforts to address the long-term effects of environmental changes worldwide.</p>

The grant will fund scholarships for UCSC students pursuing teaching careers in math and science.</p>
<p>"There is an ongoing need for highly qualified math and physical science teachers in California schools, and this grant allows us to help more students follow that career path," said Gretchen Andreasen, director of UCSC's Cal Teach Resource Center, who will manage the Noyce Scholars Program.</p>
<p>"This is a great opportunity for our science and math students who want to become teachers," added Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences at UCSC. "Our goal is to place highly skilled new teachers into high-need school districts on the Central Coast."</p>
<p>Starting in 2009, the program will prepare 32 math and science teachers over the next four years for jobs in three partner school districts: Gonzalez Unified, Pajaro Valley Unified, and Santa Cruz City Schools.</p>
<p>"With this program, we hope to increase the number of locally educated math teachers in our district and reduce our overseas recruiting," said Liz Modena, superintendent of Gonzalez Unified School District.</p>
<p>In addition to the school districts, the partners in the program include UCSC's Education Department, the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/02-06/teach.asp">Cal Teach Program</a>, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>"Preparing great teachers is a team effort that involves faculty from the sciences, engineering, and education, as well as the school districts where the students do their internships and get started in their teaching careers," Thorsett said.</p>
<p>The scholarships will support students in the UCSC Education Department's masters credential program, which leads to an M.A. in education and a California teaching credential. Students who majored in math, science, or engineering and participated in the Cal Teach Program as UCSC undergraduates will be eligible for the scholarships. The scholars will be required to work in a high-need school district for at least two years after they graduate.</p>
<p>"NSF's goal for this program is to recruit people who might not otherwise have considered a teaching career, and that's a goal of our CalTeach program as well--to increase the pool of qualified teachers," Andreasen said.</p>
<p>Most of the project funding ($623,000) will be used for the scholarships. A portion of the grant will also support research led by Lora Bartlett, assistant professor of education, to investigate issues related to the project such as teacher retention. The grant will also fund programs and activities to support the Noyce Scholars in their first two years of teaching.</p>
<p>Thorsett will direct the new program together with Michael Isaacson, acting dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, and Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of social sciences. The cross-disciplinary effort will involve faculty in 10 departments at UCSC.</p>

The newly-paved section of Bay between Escalona and High Streets was funded through the City's Measure H improvement tax and a UCSC contribution of more than $600,000.</p><p>"This project is one of the first cooperative efforts arising from the recent LRDP settlement," says Larry Pageler, Director of UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services. "After many years of traveling to campus along this pitted and patched surface, the new pavement is a great benefit to drivers, transit riders and especially bicyclists." Final lane striping of the resurfaced areas will take place in the coming weeks.</p><p>Public Works staff are managing the resurfacing of approximately 20 miles of streets throughout the City. Scheduling disruptive roadwork like this can be a challenge, as the summer tourist season winds down and the school year picks up. Still to come are additional resurfacing projects along Western Drive, and Bay Street between Mission and Escalona.</p><p>For a complete list of resurfacing projects and their tentative schedule, visit the <a href="http://www.ci.santa-cruz.ca.us/pw/">Santa Cruz City Public Works Department web site</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157ecf48072704601a012ff6c89c265"><name>2427</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students move in, parents say goodbye</title><summary>UCSC's new freshman class, which is projected to include about 3,850 students, began the process of moving away from home, hauling their stuff into dorm rooms, meeting new roommates, getting acquainted with the campus, and spreading their wings.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>move in, parent barbecue</keywords><description>UCSC's new freshman class, which is projected to include about 3,850 students, began the process of moving away from home, hauling their stuff into dorm rooms, meeting new roommates, getting acquainted with the campus, and spreading their wings.</description><start-date>1222153200000</start-date><display-name>Students move in, parents...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2427</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2427</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338712762</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1364485163910</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/09/images/move.in.hammond.katie.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/09/images/move.in.hammond.katie.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>move.in.hammond.katie.250.jpg</name><file-size>16160</file-size><width>250</width><height>199</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Katie Hammond moves stuff into Merrill with her mom, Lucy.

(Photos by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Steve and Suzanne Marz of Oxnard consider themselves "three peas in a pod" with their daughter, Stephanie. So it was with a wistful kind of excitement that they bid Stephanie goodbye on Friday, the first day of freshman move-in weekend at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"It's something that has to happen," said Suzanne Marz, who was both smiling and struggling to hold back tears, "but it doesn't make it easier."</p>
<p>Many parents felt the same way as UCSC's new freshman class, which is projected to include about 3,850 students, began the process of moving away from home, hauling their stuff into dorm rooms, meeting new roommates, getting acquainted with the campus, and spreading their wings.</p>
<p>The majority of incoming students are from California, but there are also new students this year from 26 other states (New Mexico sent the highest number at 14) and nine countries.</p>
<p>Cars lined Hagar Drive all the way to the East Remote Parking Lot, and parents milled about Quarry Plaza on Friday, toting bags from Bay Tree Bookstore, while their fresh-faced new freshmen checked out the numerous booths set up in the plaza or just hung out with their parents before saying the final goodbye.</p>
<p>"I'm a little sad," said parent John Antonakos of San Mateo, while sitting with son Jeff in Quarry Plaza after moving him into Merrill College earlier in the day. "I'm excited for him, though."</p>
<p>After a moment, he added with a laugh, "I'm feeling old today, so I'm feeling sorry for myself."</p>
<p>Students, meantime, expressed excitement at their newfound freedom and anticipation of what lay ahead of them.</p>
<p>For student Matt Miller of Sacramento, UC Santa Cruz was a good choice because of its strong environmental studies program.</p>
<p>But also, he said, "it's relatively close to home, but far enough that I don't have to come back every weekend. And I love the ocean."</p>
<p>Matt's parents, Keith and Janelle Miller, felt sad but proud to see their son go off to college.</p>
<p>"I'm glad," said Keith. "Let him go off into the world-not just to go to school, but to start his life."</p>
<p>"I think he's ready," agreed Janelle. "And it's only two and a half hours away, so we're happy about that."</p>
<p>The campus hosted its first Parent Barbecue in the Baskin Engineering Courtyard as Friday afternoon drew to a close, attracting more than 1,300 parents and family members; a similar number attended another barbecue on Saturday. The scent of grilling food drifted over Science Hill as parents trickled into the barbecue and helped themselves to burgers, salads, beans, watermelon, cookies, lemonade, and iced tea.</p>
<p>The barbecue was meant "to welcome you and introduce you to some of the campus leadership and those who will assist your student throughout the year," vice chancellor of University Relations Donna Murphy told parents.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal assured parents that their students had made the right choice.</p>
<p>"Your students are following in the footsteps of two astronauts, including the first American woman to walk in space; five Pulitzer Prize winners, including a <em>Washington Post</em> reporter who has won twice; and three members of the cast of <em>Saturday Night Live,</em>" Blumenthal said. "We believe UCSC is the leading institution for undergraduate education <em>and</em> a top-ranked research university."</p>
<p>Those kinds of credentials suit parents Tom and Haydee Licari of San Pedro, who helped move their son Nicholas into Kresge College on Friday, just fine.</p>
<p>"He's ready to change the world," said Tom Licari with a smile.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157f00f8072704601a012ff98b5a23b"><name>2429</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus provost writes about approved state budget</title><start-date>1222153200000</start-date><display-name>Campus provost writes about...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2429</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2429</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338713540</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338713540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We have just learned that the Governor has signed the 2008-09 budget for California, bringing the lengthy budget impasse to an end.</p><p>Even though it will take some time until we know the full impact to the</p><p>University of this budget compromise, I would like to share with you what</p><p>we know to date--as well as steps campus leadership have already taken to</p><p>prepare for an expected budget shortfall:</p><p>.  The Governor's January budget proposed significant cuts to the</p><p>University.  The May revision restored $98.5 million to UC's budget.  I am</p><p>pleased that the budget signed by the Governor today preserves funding to</p><p>the University consistent with the May revise.</p><p>.  While this budget, in conjunction with mandatory costs, results in</p><p>significant reductions to the University's budget, the campus has been</p><p>engaged in early planning that has allowed us to make sound budget</p><p>decisions to date.</p><p>.  In June of this year, minimum 2008-09 budget reduction targets for each</p><p>division were established based on the May revise, estimating a campus</p><p>budget shortfall of $4.5M in funding needed to cover increases in mandated</p><p>costs and to continue conservative investments in high priority areas.</p><p>.  In late July, even without the certainty of an approved state budget, I</p><p>asked principal officers to take steps to implement these minimum budget</p><p>reductions for 2008-09.</p><p>.  Budget reductions to instruction were minimized, resulting in an average</p><p>reduction of 1 percent to the academic divisions.</p><p>.  Pending further actions by the State and/or Regents, I am hopeful that</p><p>we will not, in the current year, need to make further budget reductions</p><p>beyond those implemented in July.</p><p>.  Despite the challenges, we have been able to continue investment in key</p><p>areas:  providing support for TAs and core courses, strengthening advising,</p><p>upholding earlier commitments made to IT to improve services, investing in</p><p>specific areas to improve safety and security, and continuing investment in</p><p>University Relations to ready us for a Comprehensive Campaign to increase</p><p>private support for the campus.</p><p>As noted by President Yudof, the final budget for UC is probably the best</p><p>we could have achieved in the current fiscal environment. Chancellor</p><p>Blumenthal and I share his concern about the erosion of state support for</p><p>the UC system and our campus.

Established in 2006, UCSC's program was the first of its kind in the UC system--and one of just a handful nationwide.</p><p>Earlier this spring, Sony also donated six Playstation Portable Development Kits to UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering for use by students in the campus's game design studio.</p><p>"This gift will allow us to attract the best students in the nation to come to UC Santa Cruz for our cutting-edge computer game design program," said Jim Whitehead, UCSC associate professor of computer science. Whitehead had a lead role in the design of the computer gaming major at the university.</p><p>"The donation of equipment and the financial aid funds are strong indicators of Sony's belief in, and support, for our game design program, and gives our students extraordinary opportunities to be a part of creating new games," Whitehead added. </p><p>The development of interactive computer video games is a multi-billion-dollar industry, catering to the legions of gaming enthusiasts with a steady output of new games featuring ever greater levels of technical sophistication. The UCSC program prepares students to take jobs in the computer game industry, and also gives them the option of pursuing graduate study in computer science.</p><p>"I think it's fantastic to be able to offer scholarships to incoming freshman," said UCSC associate professor of computer science Michael Mateas, a leading researcher in the area of artificial intelligence for computer games. "We will use the money to increase both quality and diversity in the gaming program."</p><p>"We look forward to working with Sony in the future, and hope that this is just the beginning of a nice collaborative relationship," he added. </p><p>UCSC's computer game design program is administered by the engineering school's Department of Computer Science and also involves faculty in the Department of Film and Digital Media in the campus's Arts Division.</p><p>The major requires a core of computer science courses to give students a solid grounding in the technical aspects of creating computer games. Additional courses in digital media permit students to focus on games from an artistic perspective. Electives allow students to explore relevant courses in art, theater, film, music, and economics. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157f50d8072704601a012ff2125cc61"><name>2433</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC named campus with 'greenest cafeterias'</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been named the campus with the "greenest cafeterias" in a survey published by Plenty magazine.</summary><author>Public Information Office (831/459-2495)</author><description>UC Santa Cruz has been named the campus with the "greenest cafeterias" in a survey published by Plenty magazine.</description><start-date>1222326000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC named campus with...</display-name><path>/2008/09/2433</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/09/2433</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338714845</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338714845</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has been named the campus with the "greenest cafeterias" in a survey published by <i>Plenty</i>, a media company dedicated to exploring and giving voice to the green revolution.</p><p>The "greenest cafeterias" ranking is part of the magazine and online site's most recent <a href="http://www.plentymag.com/features/2008/09/green_campuses.php">Green Campuses</a> survey.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157f63c8072704601a012fff101a58b"><name>2434</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Marm Kilpatrick honored by American Ornithologists' Union</title><summary>The American Ornithologists' Union has awarded its Ned K.

Marm Kilpatrick studies the impacts of disease on animal populations, the spread of pathogens to new regions, and factors affecting disease transmission. An assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Kilpatrick investigates many diseases that raise public health concerns, such as West Nile virus, avian influenza, and Lyme disease.</p>
<p>Much of Kilpatrick's work focuses on diseases affecting birds, and his contributions in this area have now been recognized by the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU), which has awarded him the Ned K. Johnson Young Investigator Award for 2008. The award recognizes outstanding and promising work by a researcher early in his or her career in any field of ornithology.</p>
<p>According to an AOU statement, Kilpatrick's work is "important, timely and at the cutting edge of the field.... [He] has become a leading figure investigating the ecology of disease in avian populations."</p>
<p>His research on West Nile virus includes a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2308">recent study</a> on the effects of higher temperatures on transmission of the virus by mosquitoes. He has also shown a connection between increases in human infections and dispersal of American robins, the preferred host of a mosquito species that is an important vector of West Nile virus.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick's research on avian influenza ("bird flu") has led to predictions about the global spread of the virulent H5N1 strain of the virus. Based on a multifaceted analysis of data on viral genetics, migratory bird movements, and global trade in poultry and pet birds, his study suggested that H5N1 is most likely to enter the Western hemisphere via poultry imports, while entry into the United States is most likely to occur via natural bird migration from neighboring countries to the south rather than through Alaska.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick is also investigating the bacterial disease brucellosis, analyzing the risk of transmission to cattle from bison and elk in Yellowstone National Park. Other projects include research on the effect of land use on Lyme disease risk; a fungal pathogen affecting frogs and other amphibians; and the effect of malaria on native Hawaiian birds.</p>
<p>Formerly a senior research scientist at the Consortium for Conservation Medicine in New York, Kilpatrick joined the UCSC faculty earlier this year. He earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.A. in philosophy from UCLA, an M.S. in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>

<p>Shakespeare Santa Cruz's 27th season was marked by five successful productions, several of which received national and regional critical acclaim. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published a half-page review with photos of three of this season's productions, raving about them all. The <em>San Jose Mercury News, Santa Cruz Sentinel, SF Weekly, Good Times</em> and <em>Metro Santa Cruz</em> also published very positive reviews. In addition to staging Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>All's Well That Ends Well,</em> SSC offered Itamar Moses's widely celebrated <em>Bach at Leipzig,</em> Lanford Wilson's <em>Burn This,</em> and the world premier of Beatrice Basso's English translation of Carlo Goldoni's 18th century comedy, <em>The Antiquarian's Family.</em> SSC's 2008 holiday show will be <em>The Wind in the Willows,</em> directed by Randall Stuart, running November 21-December 14. The production is a new version by Kate Hawley and Paul Whitworth based on the classic book by Kenneth Grahame.</p>

There is also a cyber security poster and video contest for students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Email scams:</u></strong></p>
<p>This year we've seen a dramatic increase in email scams targeted directly at the UCSC community. It's important to remember that criminals and hackers are constantly coming up with new schemes designed to compromise computers, steal personal or private information or passwords, or trick you out of money. It is cheap and easy to send millions of scam emails in the hopes that someone will take the bait.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few pointers to avoid getting fooled:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don't give out personal or sensitive information to anyone you don't know or who doesn't have a legitimate need for it - in person, online or over the phone.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Any unsolicited email or phone call asking you for account numbers, your social security number, your password or other personal or private information is suspicious. When in doubt, contact the sender separately by a method you know to be legitimate to verify the request.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Never respond to any email message or instant message (IM) with your personal information or passwords. UCSC's ITS staff will not ask you to tell them your password and neither should anyone else.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Delete spam and suspicious emails; don't open, forward or reply to them.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Don't click on links or open attachments in unsolicited or unexpected email.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Don't enter personal information or login information into online forms you access via an email or IM link.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong><u>Passwords:</u></strong></p>
<p>Passwords are often the first line of defense against hackers, so it's important to use good, hard-to-guess-or crack passwords to protect your computer and your accounts. It is equally important to keep your passwords secret and secure.</p>
<p><strong>Some key rules of thumb for passwords include:</strong></p>
<p>Passwords should be at least eight characters long with a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords that can't be this complex should be at least 10 characters long.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't use a word found in the dictionary in any language, spelled forward or backward, or a word preceded or followed by a digit (e.g., password1, 1password). Also, avoid common keyboard sequences, such as "qwerty89" or "abc123."<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Don't use your login name or personal information that someone could know or find out about you, such as names of family, places, pets, birthdays, address, your car model, etc.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Never share your password with anyone else.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Avoid writing passwords down. If you have to write something down, try to write it in a way that others won't be able to decipher--and store it securely.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Change initial passwords, password resets, and default passwords the first time you log in. These passwords can be extra vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Don't let your applications or browser remember passwords that provide access to sensitive systems or data. That way if someone gets into your computer they don't also automatically get into all of your accounts.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

The school's Research Review Day on Friday, October 17, will include faculty research presentations, graduate student posters, and more.</p>
<p>The event features a keynote address by Prith Banerjee, senior vice president of research at HP and director of HP Labs, the company's central research organization. Banerjee's talk, "The Modern Research Lab" begins at 9:30 a.m. in the Engineering 2 Simularium (Room 180). He will discuss the major themes guiding high-impact research at HP Labs and share examples of some of the innovative projects being undertaken there.</p>
<p>"The school and its departments have been developed specifically to meet the technology demands of the 21st century. The research being pursued by our faculty is already meeting those needs, and their work is truly leading edge," said Michael Isaacson, acting dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Research on six core focus areas will be presented by Baskin School faculty in a broad array of talks, including "Content-Driven Reputation on the Internet," "Single-cell Manipulations," "New Approaches to Renewable Energy," "Video Games and Computational Media: Communicating Through Code," "The Evolutionary History of the Human Genome," and "Engineering Hope with Biomimetic Systems."</p>
<p>These presentations will focus on some of the wide-ranging research projects in the Baskin School of Engineering that have transformed nearly every aspect of science and engineering and have enabled Baskin researchers to construct the world's first web-based genome browser, create an artificial retina enabling the blind to see, and develop the first program in computer game design in the UC system.</p>
<p>In addition to these presentations, attendees will have opportunities to talk with the graduate students involved in this ground-breaking research.</p>

The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Hellman's involvement in efforts to defuse the nuclear threat began in the 1980s, when he worked with the Beyond War Foundation. His <a href="http://nuclearrisk.org">current project</a> advocates the use of formal risk analysis to assess nuclear weapons policies. According to his analysis, the risk of a nuclear catastrophe is far greater than most people think. At the same time, he says, "our ability to reduce that risk is far greater than we imagine."</p><p>In his talk for the Maitra Memorial Lecture at UCSC, titled "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2008/09/maitra%20flyer_LR.pdf">Soaring, Nuclear Weapons, and World Peace</a>," Hellman will draw on his experience as a glider pilot and his expertise in encryption methods to illustrate the unacceptable level of risk now facing our society. In Hellman's view, the missteps that had the world teetering on the brink of the nuclear abyss during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis are being repeated in current events, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Georgia. </p><p>A professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford University, Hellman is famous for his invention (with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle) of public-key cryptography, the basis of secure transactions on the Internet. He has been a long-time contributor to the computer privacy debate and served on the National Research Council's Committee to Study National Cryptographic Policy, the main recommendations of which have since been implemented. </p><p>Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the IEEE and the International Association for Cryptologic Research, a Marconi international fellow, and recipient of a 1984 IEEE centennial medal. He received his B.E. from New York University and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University, all in electrical engineering.</p><p>For more information about the Maitra Memorial Lecture, call (831) 459-5003 or e-mail specialevents@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915806538072704601a012ff5cac06ae"><name>2446</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mr. President . . .</title><summary>The 44th president will have tremendous challenges before him.

Here are their responses.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Restore democracy to elections</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sheldon Kamieniecki</strong></p>
<p><em>Dean of Social Sciences and Professor of Environmental Studies</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Elections, environmental policy, politics</em></p>
<p>Our country is beginning to look like an hour glass as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class gets squeezed. Your challenge will be to rethink the goals of our government and the values of our country as far as establishing safety nets and caring for the poor.</p>
<p>Americans are not as socially minded as our European counterparts who pay high income taxes, yet we still want the same government services Europeans enjoy. We can't do both, so you'll be faced with difficult decisions.</p>
<p>As an elected politician, however, your ability to make independent decisions will be severely constrained by the pressures of special-interest groups and your own desire to be reelected, which is why your first order of business should be to seek widespread public support for meaningful campaign finance reform.</p>
<p>The current campaign-finance system undermines the central tenets and principles of democracy because it allows people with a lot of money to influence government way beyond anything that could be interpreted as free speech. Reforming the way we elect the president and members of Congress will counterbalance the influence of major corporations, unions, and all other interest groups.</p>
<p>We need to increase public funding for campaigns and decrease the cost of running for office. We need stricter controls on campaign contributions, and we need to make it easier for people to vote by extending elections to several days, including a weekend.</p>
<p>If we believe government is supposed to be accountable to its citizens, protect people equally, and provide opportunities for a satisfying quality of life, we need to correct the injustices in society. It won't happen overnight, but campaign finance reform is the first step.</p>

<p><strong><u>Rethink military spending</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Wirls</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Politics and department chair</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: U.S. politics, Congress, the presidency</em></p>
<p>The most difficult thing you're going to face is controlling military spending. Unless you make tough decisions about which Pentagon programs to cut, you will never have any budget flexibility.</p>
<p>Pentagon spending has gone unchecked for years. The Pentagon budget is $500 billion a year, on top of what we're spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's up two-thirds from 2000, for the largest increase we've seen since the unprecedented military buildup during Reagan's presidency. But at least then the public was aware of it. There was debate in Congress.</p>
<p>This spending is considered politically untouchable. Democrats are having a tough enough time figuring out how to extract the country from Iraq, and they have no political capital to spare.</p>
<p>Which is why you need to rethink the U.S. role in the world. The United States makes up half the world's military spending. We're so far ahead of everybody else, our military might isn't an issue. You have an opportunity to reconfigure our foreign and military policy so we're cooperating with our wealthy and closest allies-Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Australia. They will have to increase spending, and we will have to get away from this unilateral model.</p>
<p>Our buildup has given our allies a blank check to take care of their welfare states. In the meantime, our bridges are literally collapsing. And it's not just the money, it's the talent-the engineers and scientists. The Pentagon is spending $75 billion a year on research and development. Those experts aren't solving the energy crisis.</p>
<p>When people say we can't afford national health care, I urge them to look at the Pentagon budget. Those commitments are going to be very hard to back away from, but some of that money could do other things. You are going to have to make tough decisions about where to cut, or you won't have any money to do anything else.</p>

<p><strong><u>Strengthen the middle class</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lori Kletzer</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Economics</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Labor and employment, global trade</em></p>
<p>Part of the American dream is the belief that your kids will do better than you, and I think we're losing that. Your focus needs to be on strengthening the economic status and security of the middle class.</p>
<p>There's an awareness now that the private sector alone can't solve problems like health care and the environment. Business interests are more amenable to government leadership. Employers like General Motors are paying huge amounts to provide health insurance to their workers, and their overseas competitors don't have that same burden. There's a role for government, and moving toward universal, affordable health insurance would be a major development strengthening the middle class, as would reducing the high cost of college through more federal financial aid.</p>
<p>I want you to be more fiscally responsible and to address the budget deficit. We need to broaden the base that pays into government programs like Social Security and Medicare by increasing taxes on those with the highest incomes. We've been through eight years of tax cuts only to the wealthy. Middle-class and working-class tax cuts should be on the table.</p>
<p>At the same time, borrowing to rebuild our nation's roads, buildings, and schools is entirely more suitable than borrowing to fund a war. So, I'm not saying budgets have to be balanced, but we need to move toward balance.</p>
<p>We also need to strengthen worker-assistance programs to help all workers who lose their jobs. We need to raise the federal minimum wage. Workers need paid family leave, and you need to move vigorously to ensure that when workers want to unionize, they have the freedom to make that choice without intimidation.</p>
<p>Job growth should be linked to environmental protection. It's going to take your strong leadership, because it's going to require technology and innovation, but that's what the United States does well. It's our moment, and we should grab it.</p>

<p><strong><u>Reinvent education</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rodney Ogawa</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Education</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Educational reform, school organization, leadership</em></p>
<p>Our public school system, designed in the 19th century, is working exactly the way it was designed to work: It batches and categorizes kids by ability, and it tracks children to prepare them for different levels of employment and roles in civil society.</p>
<p>But we have very different aspirations and problems in the 21st century. Our schools are clearly failing kids from low-income and racially, culturally, and linguistically marginalized backgrounds, and we've got to do something about it.</p>
<p>First, we need to revamp the No Child Left Behind legislation. Everyone agrees schools should be held accountable, but right now they're being held accountable to a single test score, and that isn't adequate. So let's develop appropriate and genuine ways to assess student learning and school performance.</p>
<p>But our public education system needs more than reform. As an organizational researcher, I know how resistant organizations are to change, and after 150 years, I think it's time to reinvent the American school. I challenge you to begin the process in ways that will generate radical new ideas, not just tinker with the existing system.</p>
<p>Historically, as a nation we have relied on the marketplace for innovation. Just look at Silicon Valley. But I don't have much confidence in the marketplace as a mechanism for serving poor and marginalized populations.</p>
<p>The other great American tradition is democracy. As president, you can create government incentives to bring people together at the local level to decide what their schools should look like. I think we need to create civic arenas to find fresh ideas about schools.</p>
<p>If we get beyond the historical legacy of schools, what other cultural traditions can we draw on to enhance learning for kids? I don't have all the answers, but you, as president, can begin a much-needed national conversation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Confront climate change</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Press</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Environmental Studies and department chair</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Environmental politics and policy</em></p>
<p>Climate change is the single biggest challenge facing your administration. As a nation, we need to reduce our current carbon emissions by 50 to 80 percent to stabilize the climate, and we need to take a big bite out of that within 10 years.</p>
<p>There is a suite of things you need to do to get serious about climate change: introduce a carbon tax, invest in new technology, and provide greater incentives for renewable and alternative energy. There's still a role for conservation, because we can't rely on government alone, so changing individual behaviors is part of the cultural mindset you need to modify.</p>
<p>I want to see more support for manufacturing in the form of tax incentives, and I urge you to go to the next round of World Trade Organization talks and push for higher environmental standards, so our policies won't make U.S. manufacturers less competitive in the global market.</p>
<p>But climate change also presents an opportunity for job creation in redevelopment, retrofitting, installation, and manufacturing. A greener economy requires new things to be made and old things to be improved, and that translates to site-specific, skilled jobs that can't be outsourced to India.</p>
<p>All of this will require presidential leadership, but it won't take long for new tax policies and research investment to bear fruit.</p>
<p>There's a lot of pent-up frustration and concern, so you won't be starting from scratch. I don't agree when people say climate change is an unprecedented challenge for humanity. Time and again, people have reached into themselves and found what it takes to surmount what appeared to be impossible obstacles. So let's do it.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong><u>Lead the way on global warming</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Margaret Delaney</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Ocean Sciences</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Paleoceanography and marine geochemistry</em></p>
<p>You have an incredible opportunity to cut through the confusion and misinformation around climate change and help Americans become role models for the world.</p>
<p>First, we need a coherent and concise summary of the scientific evidence that climate change is real, and we need a communications campaign to help people understand what they can do that will have the greatest impact. We need to empower people to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Second, you need to focus on our national energy policy, starting with more ambitious fuel-economy standards. We need to invest in alternative energy, increase energy efficiency, and reduce consumption. You need to work with Congress to set a new tone in this country.</p>
<p>Third, we need an interdisciplinary research strategy that will support our energy policy and the outreach and education effort. We need to continue scientific research, but the agenda needs to include social science, too, because we need to influence behavior and spur people to action.</p>
<p>Lastly, the United States needs to take an international leadership role. China's government is reluctant to embrace environmental controls, because what they need is economic growth. You have an opportunity to rethink U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid in ways that will overcome this apparent dichotomy. The deployment of American ingenuity and technological innovation around the globe would benefit developing nations and help stabilize the climate.</p>
<p>We worked with our global partners to solve the ozone problem, and we did it in ways that benefited U.S. industries. We've squandered decades allowing the debate to be about whether climate change is real. It's time for large-scale change, and we need you to lead the way.</p>

Now, drawing on the same source of inspiration, he has come up with a new process for making cement that he says could help reverse global warming.</p>
<p>The standard manufacturing process for the cement used in concrete releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Constantz's process not only eliminates a major source of greenhouse gases, it actually captures carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, trapping the carbon in the cement.</p>
<p>"We're going to reverse climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide in the built environment," Constantz said.</p>
<p>The company he founded to make this "green cement," Calera Corp., was recently profiled in the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/01/MNGD12936I.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>. It is Constantz's fourth Silicon Valley startup. He previously founded and sold three medical device companies--Norian Corp., Corazon Technologies, and Skeletal Kinetics.</p>
<p>Calera's subsidiary, Moss Landing Cement Company, is building a pilot plant at Moss Landing, just down the coast from Santa Cruz. Introducing a new material to the building industry won't be easy, but the growing demand for green products is bound to help, Constantz said.</p>
<p>Constantz earned his Ph.D. in Earth sciences from UCSC in 1986. He was honored with the campus's Alumni Achievement Award in 1998.</p>

<p><strong>Campaign finance reform</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sheldon Kamieniecki</strong></p>
<p><em>Dean of Social Sciences and Professor of Environmental Studies</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Elections, environmental policy, politics</em></p>
<p>Our country is beginning to look like an hour glass as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class gets squeezed. Your challenge will be to rethink the goals of our government and the values of our country as far as establishing safety nets and caring for the poor.</p>
<p>Americans are not as socially minded as our European counterparts who pay high income taxes, yet we still want the same government services Europeans enjoy. We can't do both, so you'll be faced with difficult decisions.</p>
<p>As an elected politician, however, your ability to make independent decisions will be severely constrained by the pressures of special-interest groups and your own desire to be reelected, which is why your first order of business should be to seek widespread public support for meaningful campaign finance reform.</p>
<p>The current campaign-finance system undermines the central tenets and principles of democracy because it allows people with a lot of money to influence government way beyond anything that could be interpreted as free speech. Reforming the way we elect the president and members of Congress will counterbalance the influence of major corporations, unions, and all other interest groups.</p>
<p>We need to increase public funding for campaigns and decrease the cost of running for office. We need stricter controls on campaign contributions, and we need to make it easier for people to vote by extending elections to several days, including a weekend.</p>
<p>If we believe government is supposed to be accountable to its citizens, protect people equally, and provide opportunities for a satisfying quality of life, we need to correct the injustices in society. It won't happen overnight, but campaign finance reform is the first step.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Confront climate change</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Press</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Environmental Studies and department chair</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Environmental politics and policy</em></p>
<p>Climate change is the single biggest challenge facing your administration. As a nation, we need to reduce our current carbon emissions by 50 to 80 percent to stabilize the climate, and we need to take a big bite out of that within 10 years.</p>
<p>There is a suite of things you need to do to get serious about climate change: introduce a carbon tax, invest in new technology, and provide greater incentives for renewable and alternative energy. There's still a role for conservation, because we can't rely on government alone, so changing individual behaviors is part of the cultural mindset you need to modify.</p>
<p>I want to see more support for manufacturing in the form of tax incentives, and I urge you to go to the next round of World Trade Organization talks and push for higher environmental standards, so our policies won't make U.S. manufacturers less competitive in the global market.</p>
<p>But climate change also presents an opportunity for job creation in redevelopment, retrofitting, installation, and manufacturing. A greener economy requires new things to be made and old things to be improved, and that translates to site-specific, skilled jobs that can't be outsourced to India.</p>
<p>All of this will require presidential leadership, but it won't take long for new tax policies and research investment to bear fruit.</p>
<p>There's a lot of pent-up frustration and concern, so you won't be starting from scratch. I don't agree when people say climate change is an unprecedented challenge for humanity. Time and again, people have reached into themselves and found what it takes to surmount what appeared to be impossible obstacles. So let's do it.</p>

<p><strong>Lead the way on global warming</strong></p>
<p><strong>Margaret Delaney</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Ocean Sciences</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Paleoceanography and marine geochemistry</em></p>
<p>You have an incredible opportunity to cut through the confusion and misinformation around climate change and help Americans become role models for the world.</p>
<p>First, we need a coherent and concise summary of the scientific evidence that climate change is real, and we need a communications campaign to help people understand what they can do that will have the greatest impact. We need to empower people to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Second, you need to focus on our national energy policy, starting with more ambitious fuel-economy standards. We need to invest in alternative energy, increase energy efficiency, and reduce consumption. You need to work with Congress to set a new tone in this country.</p>
<p>Third, we need an interdisciplinary research strategy that will support our energy policy and the outreach and education effort. We need to continue scientific research, but the agenda needs to include social science, too, because we need to influence behavior and spur people to action.</p>
<p>Lastly, the United States needs to take an international leadership role. China's government is reluctant to embrace environmental controls, because what they need is economic growth. You have an opportunity to rethink U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid in ways that will overcome this apparent dichotomy. The deployment of American ingenuity and technological innovation around the globe would benefit developing nations and help stabilize the climate.</p>
<p>We worked with our global partners to solve the ozone problem, and we did it in ways that benefited U.S. industries. We've squandered decades allowing the debate to be about whether climate change is real. It's time for large-scale change, and we need you to lead the way.</p>

<p><strong>The squeeze on the middle class</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lori Kletzer</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Economics</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: Labor and employment, global trade</em></p>
<p>Part of the American dream is the belief that your kids will do better than you, and I think we're losing that. Your focus needs to be on strengthening the economic status and security of the middle class.</p>
<p>There's an awareness now that the private sector alone can't solve problems like health care and the environment. Business interests are more amenable to government leadership. Employers like General Motors are paying huge amounts to provide health insurance to their workers, and their overseas competitors don't have that same burden. There's a role for government, and moving toward universal, affordable health insurance would be a major development strengthening the middle class, as would reducing the high cost of college through more federal financial aid.</p>
<p>I want you to be more fiscally responsible and to address the budget deficit. We need to broaden the base that pays into government programs like Social Security and Medicare by increasing taxes on those with the highest incomes. We've been through eight years of tax cuts only to the wealthy. Middle-class and working-class tax cuts should be on the table.</p>
<p>At the same time, borrowing to rebuild our nation's roads, buildings, and schools is entirely more suitable than borrowing to fund a war. So, I'm not saying budgets have to be balanced, but we need to move toward balance.</p>
<p>We also need to strengthen worker-assistance programs to help all workers who lose their jobs. We need to raise the federal minimum wage. Workers need paid family leave, and you need to move vigorously to ensure that when workers want to unionize, they have the freedom to make that choice without intimidation.</p>
<p>Job growth should be linked to environmental protection. It's going to take your strong leadership, because it's going to require technology and innovation, but that's what the United States does well. It's our moment, and we should grab it.</p>

<p><strong>Rethink military spending</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Wirls</strong></p>
<p><em>Professor of Politics and department chair</em></p>
<p><em>Research focus: U.S. politics, Congress, the presidency</em></p>
<p>The most difficult thing you're going to face is controlling military spending. Unless you make tough decisions about which Pentagon programs to cut, you will never have any budget flexibility.</p>
<p>Pentagon spending has gone unchecked for years. The Pentagon budget is $500 billion a year, on top of what we're spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's up two-thirds from 2000, for the largest increase we've seen since the unprecedented military buildup during Reagan's presidency. But at least then the public was aware of it. There was debate in Congress.</p>
<p>This spending is considered politically untouchable. Democrats are having a tough enough time figuring out how to extract the country from Iraq, and they have no political capital to spare.</p>
<p>Which is why you need to rethink the U.S. role in the world. The United States makes up half the world's military spending. We're so far ahead of everybody else, our military might isn't an issue. You have an opportunity to reconfigure our foreign and military policy so we're cooperating with our wealthy and closest allies-Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Australia. They will have to increase spending, and we will have to get away from this unilateral model.</p>
<p>Our buildup has given our allies a blank check to take care of their welfare states. In the meantime, our bridges are literally collapsing. And it's not just the money, it's the talent-the engineers and scientists. The Pentagon is spending $75 billion a year on research and development. Those experts aren't solving the energy crisis.</p>
<p>When people say we can't afford national health care, I urge them to look at the Pentagon budget. Those commitments are going to be very hard to back away from, but some of that money could do other things. You are going to have to make tough decisions about where to cut, or you won't have any money to do anything else.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Current status</strong></p>
<p><u>Heller Drive</u>: Campus commuters should anticipate traffic delays along Heller Drive near the Porter College entrance road between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Wednesday, October 1, and on Thursday, October 2, with intermittent construction continuing over the next several weeks. Installation of a new water main on the west side of campus requires trenching within uphill lane of the roadway. Flaggers will be present during the construction period to provide traffic control through the one-lane section of Heller. As always, drivers and bicyclists are urged to use caution when traveling through construction areas.</p>
<p><u>Western Drive</u>: The Santa Cruz City Public Works Department has begun work restoring and resurfacing Western Drive between Empire Grade (High Street) and Meder Street. This project is expected to continue through Friday, October 10, when repaving should be completed. During this time, this section of Western Drive will be closed to through traffic.</p>
<p>Please check this this web page regularly throughout the day, especially when preparing to leave campus, for information about traffic on campus. If there is additional information on roadway conditions and traffic delays, it will be posted here.</p>
