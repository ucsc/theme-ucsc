Dominy of the University of California, Santa Cruz, has advanced the investigation of the diet of early human ancestors by painstakingly measuring the mechanical properties of the underground parts of nearly 100 plant species across sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Call it the "chewability factor" if you will, but determining the relative toughness and hardness of rhizomes, tubers, corms, and bulbs was the next step in Dominy's exploration of the hypothesis that our earliest ancestors may have eaten a diet rich in plants, specifically their carbohydrate-rich underground storage organs (USOs).</p><p>The flat, thickly enameled molars of early humans have led scientists to infer that their diet consisted primarily of hard, brittle foods, with recent evidence suggesting that USOs played a key role as "fallback foods" eaten during times of scarcity. </p><p>"This was the first time anyone has measured the properties of these hypothetical foods to see if they match what we've been inferring from the fossil record," said Dominy, who field-tested the hardness and toughness of 98 species of USOs. "Our data for bulbs and corms fit most researchers' expectations for the physical properties of hominin foods. What we found in some ways merely confirmed the obvious."</p><p>But Dominy's new study, published in the online edition of the journal <i>Evolutionary Biology</i>, also adds unexpected insights, because his analysis suggests that different hominin species relied to varying degrees on USOs. Particularly when combined with other lines of evidence, Dominy's newest findings fill an important empirical void.</p><p>The study marks the third avenue of investigation Dominy has employed in his pathbreaking research on diet and human evolution. Dominy has drawn on the fields of chemistry, molecular biology, and genetics to explore the source of the nutritional bonanza that gave early human ancestors an edge over all other primates. His contributions include the revelation that humans are uniquely adapted to digest starch and the resolution of a conundrum that bolstered the USO hypothesis by confirming that USOs leave the same chemical signature on tooth enamel as grass does (see earlier press releases about <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1553">starch</a> and <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1251">USOs</a>).</p><p>In the new paper, entitled "Mechanical Properties of Plant Underground Storage Organs and Implications for Dietary Models of Early Hominins," Dominy tested USOs, which plants use to store water and carbohydrates. His data establish rhizomes as the toughest, followed by tubers, corms, and bulbs (familiar examples of which include Bermuda grass, potatoes, iris, and onions, respectively). Corms and bulbs emerged as the most plausible hominin foods, according to Dominy, because their physical qualities match up with dietary inferences based on dental morphology and modern chemical isotopic analysis. </p><p>The new data also allowed Dominy to correlate plant characteristics with the dental morphology of different species of hominins. The teeth of Australopithecus, for example, appear well-suited to process bulbs, while the teeth of Paranthropus appear well-adapted to process hard and brittle corms. </p><p>Finally, prompted by his own observations of Hadza hunter-gatherers in northern Tanzania, Dominy also conducted a pilot field study of the effects of roasting by Hadza on the toughness of five tuber species. The results, that roasting lessens the work of chewing and thereby enhances digestibility, add to the plausibility of relatively tough tubers in the diet of hominins.</p><p>Dominy's coauthors on the paper were Erin R. Vogel, an associate researcher and lecturer in anthropology at UCSC; Justin D. Yeakel, a doctoral candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; Paul Constantino, a postdoctoral associate at George Washington University; and Peter W. Lucas, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University.</p><p>####</p><p><b>Note to Journalists</b>: Dominy may be reached at (831) 459-2541 or njdominy@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915784db8072704601a012ffaa10dc5c"><name>2347</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor condemns anti-research harassment</title><start-date>1217574000000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor condemns anti-research harassment...</display-name><path>/2008/08/2347</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/2347</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338686110</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338686110</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Earlier this week, fliers threatening a number of our faculty members were discovered at a Santa Cruz coffee house and turned over to police.</p><p>The threatening leaflets contained the researchers' names, addresses, and other personal information.

<p>In one case, <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2349">a fire was started in a vehicle</a> parked in a faculty member's driveway.

<p>These unconscionable acts put the researchers, their families - including their children - and their neighbors in grave danger. They follow earlier aggressive acts of intimidation, trespassing, vandalism, and a physical attack last spring and the discovery of leaflets this past week threatening UCSC research scientists.</p>
<p>These are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live.</p>
<p>The campus is taking this extremely seriously and is working closely with law enforcement agencies and our own campus resources to identify and apprehend the perpetrators as well as taking major proactive steps to support researchers in the face of violence and intimidation. The personal safety and security of all our students, faculty, and staff is our highest priority.</p>
<p>I am asking everyone in the campus community to be especially vigilant in the face of these criminal acts. We all must heighten our awareness. Please be aware of your surroundings on campus and in your neighborhoods and report any suspicious activities immediately. Call 911 or UCSC police at 831-459-2231.</p>

<p>"In previous simulations, this region came out smooth, but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter," said Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The results, reported in the August 7 issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>, may help scientists figure out what the dark matter is. So far, it has been detected only through its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies. According to one theory, however, dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which can annihilate each other and emit gamma rays when they collide. Gamma rays from dark matter annihilation could be detected by the recently launched Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), which UCSC physicists helped build (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2243">Currents story</a>).</p>
<p>"That's what makes this exciting," Madau said. "Some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation, and it might easily be detected by GLAST."</p>
<p>Juerg Diemand, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and first author of the <em>Nature</em> paper, said the simulation is based on the assumptions of "cold dark matter" theory, the leading explanation for how the universe evolved after the Big Bang. In a separate paper that has been accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal,</em>, the researchers used their findings to make specific predictions about the gamma-ray signals that would be detectable by GLAST. The lead author of this paper is Michael Kuhlen, a former UCSC graduate student now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>"There are several candidate particles for cold dark matter, and our predictions for GLAST depend on the assumed particle type and its properties," Diemand said. "For typical WIMPs, anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma-ray background after two years of observations. That would be a big discovery for GLAST."</p>
<p>Although the nature of dark matter remains a mystery, it appears to account for about 82 percent of the matter in the universe. As a result, the evolution of structure in the universe has been driven by the gravitational interactions of dark matter. The ordinary matter that forms stars and planets has fallen into the "gravitational wells" created by clumps of dark matter, giving rise to galaxies in the centers of dark matter halos.</p>
<p>According to the cold dark matter theory of cosmological evolution, gravity acted initially on slight density fluctuations present shortly after the Big Bang to pull together the first clumps of dark matter. These grew into larger and larger clumps through the hierarchical merging of smaller progenitors.</p>
<p>This is the process that Diemand and Madau's team simulated on the Jaguar supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The simulation took about one month to run and followed the gravitational interactions of more than a billion parcels of dark matter over 13.7 billion years. Running on up to 3,000 processors in parallel, the computations used about 1.1 million processor-hours.</p>
<p>"It simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the Big Bang until the present epoch, so practically the entire age of the universe, and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the Milky Way," Diemand said. "We see a lot of substructure, even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is."</p>
<p>The simulation revealed numerous subhalos and streams of dark matter within the halo of the Milky Way, and more substructure appears within each subhalo, Madau said. "Every substructure has its own sub-substructure, and so on. There are lumps on all scales," he said.</p>
<p>The most massive of the subhalos would be likely to host dwarf galaxies such as those observed orbiting the Milky Way. By studying the motions of stars within dwarf galaxies, astronomers can calculate the density of the dark matter in the subhalos and compare that with the densities predicted by the simulation.</p>
<p>"We can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the Milky Way. The appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo," Diemand said.</p>
<p>The central densities in the simulated dark matter subhalos are consistent with the observations of stellar motions in dwarf galaxies, he said. But there remains a discrepancy between the number of dark matter subhaloes in the simulation and the number of dwarf galaxies that have been observed around the Milky Way. Some subhalos may remain dark if, for example, they are not sufficiently massive to support star formation, Madau said.</p>
<p>In addition to Diemand and Madau, the coauthors of the Nature paper include Michael Kuhlen of the Institute for Advanced Study; Marcel Zemp, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC, who developed a time-stepping algorithm that made the simulation remarkably accurate; and Ben Moore, Doug Potter, and Joachim Stadel at the University of Zurich. This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.</p>

(Photo by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>More than 200 community and campus members gathered at the UC Santa Cruz entrance Monday afternoon to show their support for scientific research at the university and denounce two recent firebombings targeting UCSC researchers.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal told the gathered crowd he was "extremely grateful not only to see faculty and staff, but also members of the community, as well. We have people here doing cutting-edge research on cancer and disease, and by coming out here today, you are showing support for that research."</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Santa Cruz Mayor Ryan Coonerty and Santa Cruz Police Chief Howard Skerry announced a $30,000 reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the attacks. Tuesday, the FBI added $20,000 to the reward, bringing it to $50,000.</p>
<p>"These threats and attacks are shocking and abhorrent," Coonerty said at Monday's news conference at the police station. "Let me be clear: This is not protest, but terrorism."</p>
<p>Skerry said investigators have discovered "significant forensic evidence" at the scenes of both incidents but gave no information about possible suspects.</p>
<p>"We are not going to stop until we find those responsible," said Skerry. He asked for the community's help, urging anyone with information to call the investigations department at (831) 420-5820 or the anonymous tip line at (831) 420-5995.</p>
<p>Seven TV news vans lined the perimeter of Monday evening's informal rally at the base of campus, which materialized almost overnight in response to the weekend attacks on UCSC professors.</p>
<p>Psychology professor Margarita Azmitia said she attended the rally to support the research that goes on at the campus.</p>
<p>"Violence is not the way, and I wanted to come with my kids and support that point," she said.</p>
<p>"My feeling is that this is an act of terrorism, and our response should be to stand up and say we won't be terrorized," added Bob Hanson, who noted that he was a retired research astronomer who had worked at UCSC for three decades.</p>
<p>The crowd included Mayor Coonerty and City Council members Mike Rotkin, Emily Reilly, Tony Madrigal, and Lynn Robinson.</p>
<p>The idea for a campus rally came to Jack Mallory only 24 hours before the event. A former visiting assistant professor of anthropology at UCSC, he now teaches at Santa Cruz High School.</p>
<p>"What motivated me was I saw two students yesterday carrying signs supporting research at the base of campus, and I thought, 'Why aren't there 200 people there?'" he said. "We want people to know that this (violence) is unacceptable in this community."</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Police, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and UCSC Police are investigating the early Saturday morning attacks at the homes of two biomedical researchers.</p>
<p>In one case, the Village Circle home of a UCSC researcher was firebombed. The professor and his family, including two young children, were home at the time. They escaped down a fire ladder from a second-story window. Santa Cruz police are investigating the case as an attempted homicide.</p>
<p>The family's address was among those listed in animal rights fliers left at a downtown coffee house July 29. The leaflets contained UCSC researchers' names, addresses, and other personal information.</p>
<p>Also on Saturday morning, a car was destroyed by fire at faculty housing on Dickens Way on the UCSC campus close to the same time as the home-firebombing incident.</p>
<p>The incidents have been designated as acts of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>UCSC is providing $15,000 of the reward; the FBI added $20,000; $2,500 is from the Humane Society of the United States; the balance is from community members and the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The violent acts follow a string of attacks by suspected anti-science extremists dating back to an attempted firebombing of a police car in March 2007.</p>
<p>In February, UCSC researchers experienced several acts of harrassment and vandalism, and masked demonstrators provoked a confrontation at a UCSC scientist's home.</p>
<p>UC President Mark Yudof said in a statement that the attacks are "outrageous."</p>
<p>"As we remain steadfast in our support of the free, civil, and lawful expression of views, we are equally unwavering in our commitment to protect our faculty, staff, and students and to hold the perpetrators of these acts accountable," Yudof said.</p>
<p>He pledged to continue to work with Assemblyman Gene Mullin, D-San Mateo, for the passage of AB 2296, which aims to provide more tools to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.</p>

<p>Aram is 20 years old, but he'd never experienced a full day of electricity until he came to America a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>"The generators only work for seven to eight hours a day," said Aram, an Iraqi business and management student who attends a Western-style university in Kurdistan. "In the winters, it's hard, because we live in a mountainous place. And the summer is really hot."</p>
<p>Aram, one of 17 students participating in the Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange Program at UCSC this summer, is experiencing 24-hour-a-day electricity and many other American conveniences during a six-week course sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in Washington, D.C. UCSC is one of only six universities in the nation to host the program, which is in its second year.</p>
<p>The program, run through UC Extension and managed by international education and development nonprofit World Learning, provides opportunities for Iraqi youth to participate in classroom study, learn first-hand about the United States, and develop leadership and problem-solving skills they can apply in their society.</p>
<p>"They're just wonderful students," said Susan Miller, director of Education and International Programs at UC Extension, Santa Cruz. "I see great hope for Iraq in this group. If these kids can be in charge, there's a very bright future, because they are so smart, so eager to learn and to experience life here. They're going to go back with lots of dreams and memories that will hopefully carry them to a new future."</p>
<p>Three students volunteered to speak with <em>Currents</em> about the program and their experiences in the United States. Though students come from all over Iraq, all three volunteers were Kurds. Kurdistan, an autonomous federal entity, is in the northern part of the country and less affected by the Iraq War than other parts.</p>
<p>President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced the Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange initiative in a joint press conference in 2006. About 100 Iraqi university students are participating in the program this summer. The participants, recruited in Iraq through a nationwide, merit-based selection process, take part in six-week intensive study institutes. Each student is assigned to a specific thematic institute based upon its relevance to his or her major course of study in Iraq.</p>
<p>More than 250 Iraqi students applied for the program, according to Goli Ameri, assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>"We're looking for rising leaders," she said. "The one unifying factor for us is leadership capability. So these kids already come with a desire to make a difference."</p>
<p>The program is part of the Study of the U.S. Branch program, which each year brings a number of different undergraduates from a wide variety of countries to the United States for four to six weeks of intensive academic study, said Ameri.</p>
<p>"Every study program focuses on some fundamental understanding," she said. "Especially for this Study of the U.S. Branch, a focus on the fundamental American values of democracy, individual rights, and tolerance are very much emphasized, as well as problem-solving skills, thinking, and communication. Service and volunteerism are also part of all the exchange programs we do."</p>
<p>At UCSC, the study theme is Science and Technology. UCSC received the program in part because "it's focused on science and technology, which is a very important field for these people," Ameri said. "And being close to Silicon Valley was another factor."</p>
<p>Since arriving in Santa Cruz, the students have done volunteer work at the Homeless Garden Project and the Boys' and Girls' Club of Santa Cruz. They've witnessed a murder trial, interviewed Americans, visited Sacramento, gone to classes on leadership, and chowed down on burgers, burritos, and fried chicken.</p>
<p>As part of the science and technology component of their study, they've done tours of local high-tech companies and visited the Computer History Museum, the Intel Museum, and the NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p>Beyond checking out American customs, norms, systems, and luxuries, the students are here to learn, and take that information back to their homeland. They're taking a course on American Studies to get an overview of the social fabric in the United States; a course on the effect of science and technology on American society; a component on leadership; and courses in English.</p>
<p>Being in contact with American institutions helps the Iraqis see the way young students at universities think, and how much critical thinking and questioning of ideas happens in classrooms, said Educational and Cultural Affairs' Ameri, a native of Iran.</p>
<p>"In the Middle East, critical thinking is not encouraged," she said. "They come here and they see there's no rote learning going on. Kids are thinking of ideas and making decisions, and the professor is there more as a guide."</p>
<p>Information technology student Mistan, 18, also of Kurdistan, would "like to get the hang of electronics."</p>
<p>"It's really cool around here--the revolution of technology is so fast," he said. "We have iPhones and things like that, but we import them--we don't make them there."</p>
<p>Medical student Mobed, 20, wants to see a medical facility so he can compare it to the ones back home. But he also wants to tell his friends, family, and neighbors about Americans and life in the United States.</p>
<p>American equality has impressed him.</p>
<p>"There's no separation between religions," Mobed said. "In our country, there's inequality. That's one of our main problems."</p>
<p>Americans who come into contact with these students will get a far deeper understanding of Iraq and its youth and how they see the world, said Ameri.</p>
<p>"People realize how much they have in common," she said. "In fact, they find they have a lot more in common than they don't."</p>
<p>The bureau does exchanges with 165 countries around the world, according to Ameri.</p>
<p>The other five universities hosting the Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange Program are:</p>

<li>University of Connecticut (Entrepreneurship)<br/>

There are groups working on an artificial retina to restore sight to the blind, a glucose sensor for diabetics, and the toxic effects on humans and in the environment of heavy metals such as lead and manganese.</p><p>The campus has been especially effective at fostering creative, interdisciplinary approaches to fundamental human health problems. "Our secret advantage is the ability of our students and faculty to cross traditional departmental lines in order to tackle really tough problems," Thorsett said. "Bringing computer science and wet lab biology together to form a world-class group in bioinformatics and genomics is one good example of that."</p><p>The absence of a medical school at UCSC rules out clinical research involving patients. But clinical advances depend on discoveries in areas such as genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and toxicology. In these areas, UCSC has built strong programs and established an impressive record of accomplishments. </p><p>Understanding the basic biological processes involved in human diseases is an essential step in developing new ways to prevent and treat them. Often, biologists can study these fundamental processes in the test tube or in simple organisms, such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Other studies require the use of animals more closely related to humans, such as mice and rats. Fruit flies don't have mammary glands, for example, so mice are often used for research on breast cancer.</p><p>The use of animals in research, at UCSC and elsewhere, is strictly regulated to ensure that the studies are justified and the animals are treated humanely. Every proposal is reviewed by an oversight committee, and research facilities undergo regular inspections.</p><p>Much of the funding for health-related research comes from the National Institutes of Health, which provides more than $10 million in grants to UCSC researchers every year.</p><p>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), meanwhile, has provided $16.5 million to fund the campus's growing stem cell research program. UCSC's ability to attract this level of funding through peer-reviewed grant programs is a testament to the quality of its  health-sciences faculty and their ongoing research programs. </p><p>At the same time, the campus has created a comprehensive and innovative health-sciences major to prepare students for careers in medicine. Established in 2003 and administered by the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, the health-sciences program is the campus's fastest growing major and among its most popular. </p><p>Enrollment has grown to 640 students in four years. </p><p>Designed with California's health care needs in mind, the program requires students to become proficient in Spanish and to complete  an internship in a community health care setting.</p><p>The Spanish-language component of the program teaches students both medical terminology and conversational skills, while the internship allows students to see the day-in, day-out practice of a working health professional. Health-care-professional schools are looking for people with just that kind of field experience, said Grant Hartzog, associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology and a member of the program's advisory committee. </p><p>"It's one way of measuring someone's commitment, and making sure people have a good understanding of what they're getting themselves into," Hartzog said.</p><p>The health sciences major complements the health-related research programs at UCSC. These successful programs benefit students, the state of California, and the world at large, Thorsett said. "Our faculty, researchers, and students are deeply engaged in research that will transform our understanding of health and disease, and our graduates are ready to help meet the increasingly complex technological, scientific, and social challenges that health care faces in California and the world."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915794728072704601a012ffc32ea5dd"><name>2363</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the News</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1218178800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2008/08/2363</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/2363</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338690102</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338690102</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

<p>The agreement is expected to be formally approved and signed by all parties this coming week. The agreement is between the City and County of Santa Cruz, UC Santa Cruz and the UC Regents, the Coalition to Limit University Expansion and 11 individual litigants.</p>
<p>The agreement sets the course for a new collaborative relationship in the Santa Cruz community, one that I hope and expect will become a model for campus and community relations everywhere.</p>
<p>The agreement is good for the campus and good for Santa Cruz. It allows the university to meet its mission of teaching, research, and public service for the State of California and includes mutually enforceable measures to address traffic impacts, conserve water, and provide housing for new students.</p>
<p>An important and innovative aspect is the campus community's ability to actively participate in controlling and alleviating impacts of campus growth. The agreement contains positive incentives that will motivate the university to meet agreed upon goals, save resources, reduce impacts and continue to be good stewards of this magnificent campus and community.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached after more than seven months of mediated discussions and a lot of hard work and good faith by many people - on campus and off. Through our many face-to-face conversations, we learned a great deal about each other's interests and challenges. Everyone's willingness to listen and understand created an atmosphere in which this landmark agreement was possible.</p>
<p>I want to commend each one of them, with special appreciation to Mayor Ryan Coonerty, who provided exemplary leadership and dedication that facilitated the discussions and clarified important issues.</p>
<p>I applaud the hard work and thoughtful due diligence of all who participated - principals of the City and County of Santa Cruz, the Coalition to Limit University Expansion, the Rural Bonny Doon Association, and UCSC. I am gratified that it has been resolved in a way that benefits all of us and encourages continued partnership and collaboration in Santa Cruz.</p>

Join gardening expert Trish Hildinger for a lecture and demonstration workshop on "Planting the Thanksgiving Feast" at the UC Santa Cruz Farm on Sunday, August 24, from 10 a.m to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Hildinger, an experienced school gardening instructor, will teach you how to plan ahead and extend your gardening season with timely tips on what to plant and how to plant it for harvest at Thanksgiving and through the winter.</p>
<p>The class will include information on vegetable varieties that perform well in this region, direct seeding and transplanting techniques, and soil preparation for fall planting. Planting a late-summer garden is a great way to save money on your fall and winter grocery bills.</p>
<p>Cost of the workshop is $15 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden, and $20 for the general public, payable the day of the class (check or cash only). No pre-registration is necessary. Wear comfortable walking shoes and sun protection. Memberships to the Friends of the Farm and Garden are available at the workshop.</p>

This system will provide students, faculty, and staff with timely and critical information during a life-threatening emergency. It delivers voice messages to telephones, text and voice messages to cell phones, and email to all CruzMail and other registered accounts.</p><p>During an emergency, campus police and fire department responders will determine if there is a threat that requires immediate action, and if needed, will immediately initiate a CruzAlert message to students, faculty, and staff.</p><p>I encourage you to sign up for CruzAlert today at: <a href="http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu/">http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu/</a> and follow the sign up instructions in the right hand column.

On September 10, LHC scientists will attempt to send the first beam of protons speeding around the accelerator.</p>
<p>The LHC will put hotly debated theories to the test as it generates a bonanza of new experimental data in the coming years. Potential breakthroughs include an explanation of what gives mass to fundamental particles and identification of the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the universe. More exotic possibilities include evidence for new forces of nature or hidden extra dimensions of space and time.</p>
<p>"The LHC is a discovery machine. We don't know what we'll find," said Abraham Seiden, professor of physics and director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>SCIPP was among the initial group of institutions that spearheaded U.S. participation in the LHC. About half of the entire U.S. experimental particle-physics community has focused its energy on the ATLAS and CMS detectors, the largest of four detectors where experiments will be performed at the LHC. SCIPP researchers have been working on the ATLAS project since 1994. It is one of many international physics and astrophysics projects that have drawn on SCIPP's 20 years of experience developing sophisticated technology for tracking high-energy subatomic particles.</p>
<p>The scale of the LHC is gigantic in every respect--its physical size, the energies attained, the amount of data it will generate, and the size of the international collaboration involved in its planning, construction, and operation. In September, high-energy beams of protons will begin circulating around the LHC's 27-kilometer (16.8-mile) accelerator ring located 100 meters (328 feet) underground at CERN, the European particle physics lab based in Geneva, Switzerland. After a period of testing, the beams will cross paths inside the detectors and the first collisions will take place.</p>
<p>Even before the machine is ramped up to its maximum energy early next year, it will smash protons together with more energy than any previous collider. The debris from those collisions--showers of subatomic particles that the detectors will track and record--will yield results that could radically change our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p>In a talk at the American Physical Society meeting earlier this year, Seiden gave an overview of the LHC research program, including a rough timeline for reaching certain milestones. One of the most highly anticipated milestones, for example, is detection of the Higgs boson, a hypothetical particle that would fill a major gap in the standard model of particle physics by endowing fundamental particles with mass. Detection of the Higgs boson is most likely to occur in 2010, Seiden said.</p>
<p>But there's no guarantee that the particle actually exists; nature may have found another way to create mass. "I'm actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the Higgs," Seiden said.</p>
<p>Technically, the Higgs boson was postulated to explain a feature of particle interactions known as the breaking of electroweak symmetry, and the LHC is virtually guaranteed to explain that phenomenon, according to theoretical physicist Howard Haber.</p>
<p>"We've been debating this for 30 years, and one way or another, the LHC will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs. That's a fundamental advance," said Haber, a professor of physics at UCSC.</p>
<p>Haber and other theorists have spent years imagining possible versions of nature, studying their consequences, and describing in detail what the evidence would look like in the experimental data from a particle accelerator such as the LHC. The Higgs boson won't be easy to find, he said. The LHC should produce the particles in abundance (if they exist), but most of them will not result in a very distinctive signal in the detectors.</p>
<p>"It's a tough game. You can only do it by statistical analysis, since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a Higgs boson signal," Haber said.</p>
<p>Evidence to support another important theory--supersymmetry--could show up sooner. In many ways, supersymmetry is a more exciting possibility than the Higgs boson, according to theorist Michael Dine, also a professor of physics at UCSC.</p>
<p>"By itself, the Higgs is a very puzzling particle, so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model. Supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know," Dine said.</p>
<p>Adding to its appeal, supersymmetry predicts the existence of particles that are good candidates to account for dark matter. Astronomers have detected dark matter through its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies, but they don't yet know what it is. Particles predicted by supersymmetry that could account for dark matter may be identified at the LHC as early as next year, Seiden said.</p>
<p>"Initially, we'll be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly. In 2009, we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry," he said.</p>
<p>The massive ATLAS detector--45 meters (148 feet) long and 25 meters (82 feet) high--has involved more than 2,000 physicists at 166 institutions. Seiden's team at SCIPP has been responsible for developing the silicon sensors and electronics for the detector's inner tracker, which measures the trajectories of charged particles as they first emerge from the site of the collisions.</p>
<p>Seiden is now leading the U.S. effort to develop a major upgrade of ATLAS. The current detector is designed to last for 10 years, and the upgrade will coincide with a planned increase in the luminosity of the proton beams at the LHC (which will then become the "Super LHC").</p>
<p>"These large projects take such a long time, we have to start early," Seiden said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, operation and testing of the current ATLAS detector is already under way at CERN, said Alexander Grillo, a SCIPP research physicist who has been working on the project from the start.</p>
<p>"We've been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles," he said. "Nature gives us these cosmic rays for free, and they're the same kinds of particles we'll see when the machine turns on, so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector. But we're very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine."</p>
<p>ATLAS and the other LHC detectors are designed with "trigger" systems that ignore most of the signals and record only those events likely to yield interesting results. Out of the hundreds of millions of collisions happening every second inside the detector, only 100 of the most promising events will be selected and recorded in the LHC's central computer system.</p>
<p>"We'll be throwing away a lot of data, so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly," Seiden said.</p>
<p>Grillo noted that the ATLAS project has been a great opportunity for UCSC students. Both graduate students and undergraduates have been involved in the development of the detector, along with postdoctoral researchers, research physicists, and senior faculty.</p>
<p>"The graduate students and postdocs get to go to Geneva, but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment," Grillo said.</p>
<p>SCIPP's prominent role in the LHC is also a boon for theoretical physicists at UCSC who are not directly involved in the collaboration, such as Dine, Haber, Thomas Banks, and others.</p>
<p>"There is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at UCSC, which is not the case at other leading institutions," Dine said. "For me, it's valuable just in terms of being aware of what's happening on the experimental side."</p>
<p>According to Haber, the LHC is certain to generate a lot of excitement in the world of physics.</p>
<p>"If nothing were found beyond what we know today, that would be so radical, because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles," he said.</p>

"So it's not so much a profound intellectual shift, but more a big methodological shift." </p><p>"The old ways of research look for repeating patterns in different languages and involve working closely with different speakers," McCloskey added. "The new methods focus on running carefully controlled experiments and testing hypotheses. We're just finding new, more rigorous ways to ask age-old questions."</p><p>The UCSC doctoral program in Linguistics has the distinction of being one of the top-ranked programs in North America according to the National Research Council. </p><p>Graduates of the program now hold tenured faculty positions in colleges and universities across the country, and in Europe and Japan, including the University of Chicago; UC Berkeley; the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; New York University; Swarthmore College; and USC. </p><p>Presentations at the conference by returning alums will include such topics as:</p><p>. How meaning can be constructed from silence (Jason Merchant, Chicago)</p><p>. How color terms are used and understood in languages of the world  (Chris          Kennedy, Chicago, and Louise McNally, Barcelona)</p><p>. Using language to trace the origin of gypsy populations in Spain (John Moore, UC San Diego)</p><p>. Using computer models to simulate-and better understand-how languages change in large populations (Andy Wedel, Tucson)</p><p></p><p>"We're very happy to welcome back to Santa Cruz an illustrious group of former students-now colleagues-who have made contributions in many areas of linguistics during the past 20 years," said McCloskey. "Part of the conference is looking back at what we've achieved and also looking forward.</p><p>"It's like our 21st birthday party.a year late," he added.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157a7098072704601a012ff535c0159"><name>2377</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Signs of the times</title><summary>As construction progresses at Ranch View Terrace, crews are putting the finishing touches on the road and sidewalk leading to the development and lots of signs.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, gwenm@ucsc.edu, (831) 459-5310</author><description>As construction progresses at Ranch View Terrace, crews are putting the finishing touches on the road and sidewalk leading to the development and lots of signs.</description><start-date>1219302000000</start-date><display-name>Signs of the times...</display-name><path>/2008/08/2377</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/2377</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338694847</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338694847</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/08/images/signforest.540.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/08/images/signforest.540.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>signforest.540.jpg</name><file-size>78985</file-size><width>540</width><height>332</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Stop, walk, bike, this way, slow, merge, yield, don't walk . what?</p><p>As construction progresses at Ranch View Terrace, crews are putting the finishing touches on the road and sidewalk leading to the development, which will provide 45 single-family homes in its first phase.</p><p>At the intersection of the new street, the campus bike path, and the fire road that leads past CASFS, this new forest of signs sprouted up overnight, providing an abundance of instruction to the uncertain pedestrian, bicyclist, or driver.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157a89f8072704601a012ffaf88852d"><name>2378</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;

Ted was most recently a cook at the Crown/Merrill dining hall but his presence was truly campus wide. Ted had worked on campus for Dining Services for over 34 years starting in 1974 with Marriott and continuing on with UC Santa Cruz Dining.  Ted had a wealth of culinary knowledge, which he shared with everyone each day. Ted worked with many student employees and literally prepared and served hundreds of thousands of meals to our UCSC community. Ted's engaging dry sense of humor had an impact on all of us! Ted was a force within Dining Services and will be missed greatly.  Ted is survived by his wife, Lucy Kemnitzer, son Frank Trollman and daughter Emma Trollman. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty </audience><admin>Scott Berlin, Director of Dining and Hospitality Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157b0498072704601a012ffbbe5cf57"><name>2384</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>After nearly 45 years, new redwood sign graces main campus entrance</title><summary>Out with the old and in with the new.

"The redwood is a symbol of how this university campus blends into the land on which it is built."</p><p>Over the years, weather, termites and dry rot took their toll on the original sign. One end had started to disintegrate. Holes and soft spots are scattered throughout.</p><p>Jim Dunne, associate director of physical plant, said he knew it was only a matter of time for the old sign so a couple of years ago he asked Frank "Lud" McCrary of Big Creek Lumber if he could help him find a new piece of redwood - a big piece. Something that size is hard to come by these days. At first, McCrary didn't think he had anything big enough. Then he remembered a fallen snag that had lain on his daughter's property off Swanton Road for 25 years. </p><p>The old redwood snag had stood, although dead and scarred, for at least 100 years, probably a lot longer. Fire had hollowed its once 28-foot girth into a semi-circle of charred wood. Then it fell, undermined by a surging Scott Creek swollen by the torrential rains that inundated Santa Cruz County in January 1982, McCrary recalled. </p><p>The McCrary family agreed to donate the fallen log to UCSC. Dunne and McCrary raised it and trucked it to the sawmill.  After more than a dozen cuts, an inch at a time, a beautiful rectangle of solid redwood emerged, identical to the original, give or take half an inch. It's nearly 24 feet long, 44 inches high, and 19 inches thick, with clean, clear grain. The backside is uneven at one end, displaying the ravages of an ancient forest fire.</p><p>The next challenge was finding the right artist to carve the front. Enter Chris Stinehour of Berkeley, who works with architects and designers. Stinehour based his design on the original letters, producing three sample layouts. "Once you get to carving, all the hard work is done," he said. "You just have to work with the material."</p><p>Over several months, a day at a time, Stinehour visited Santa Cruz to carve, using razor-sharp chisels and a wooden mallet, cutting letter by letter against the wood's grain. You don't want to carve with the grain, Stinehour said, otherwise  "the grain might take you somewhere you don't want to go."</p><p>Once the letters were cut, Stinehour primed the interior faces and painted them gold. "I hope they get another 40 years out of it," he said. </p><p>The McCrarys donated the giant timber for the original sign, too. Monday, some 43 years later, it was placed on a flatbed and trucked back to Big Creek. There, McCrary hopes to find enough solid wood to mill into something useful, perhaps shakes for historic buildings in the area. "We don't want to waste it," he said.  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9157b1dd8072704601a012ffabc957f4"><name>2385</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student journalist reports from Democratic Convention</title><summary>Lisa Donchak, a reporter from UCSC's City on a Hill Press, is blogging from the Democratic National Convention this week for the student newspaper.</summary><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><description>Lisa Donchak, a reporter from UCSC's City on a Hill Press, is blogging from the Democratic National Convention this week for the student newspaper.</description><start-date>1219647600000</start-date><display-name>Student journalist reports from...</display-name><path>/2008/08/2385</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/2385</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338697609</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338697609</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Lisa Donchak, a reporter from UCSC's <i>City on a Hill Press</i>, is covering the Democratic National Convention this week for the student newspaper.</p><p>Donchak applied for media credentials to cover the national conventions of the two major political parties this summer; only her application to cover the Democrat's convention in Denver was approved.</p><p>While her coverage of the convention will appear in CHP's print editions early this fall, she is blogging from the convention all of this week.

The spacecraft and its revolutionary instruments passed their orbital checkout with flying colors.</p>
<p>Development of GLAST's gamma-ray tracker was led by a team of UC Santa Cruz physicists at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2243">earlier press release</a>). Robert Johnson, who led the SCIPP team, said the tracker, which includes nearly 900,000 active detection channels, is performing exceedingly well.</p>
<p>"The entire instrument is performing according to the design expectations," said Johnson, a professor of physics at UCSC. "The initial images illustrate well the enormous leap in capability of GLAST relative to previous instruments."</p>
<p>NASA announced today that GLAST has been renamed the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The new name honors Enrico Fermi (1901-1954), a pioneer in high-energy physics. "Fermi was the first to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds, and this work provides the foundation for understanding the powerful phenomena his namesake will observe," said Paul Hertz, chief scientist for science missions at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Scientists expect Fermi will discover many new pulsars in our own galaxy, reveal powerful processes near supermassive black holes at the cores of thousands of active galaxies, and enable a search for signs of new physical laws.</p>
<p>For two months following the spacecraft's June 11 launch, scientists tested and calibrated its two instruments, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM). The LAT has already verified sources found by other gamma-ray detectors and discovered more.</p>
<p>The LAT team today unveiled an all-sky image showing the glowing gas of the Milky Way, blinking pulsars, and a flaring galaxy billions of light-years away. The map combines 95 hours of the instrument's "first light" observations. A similar image, produced by NASA's now-defunct Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, took years of observations to produce.</p>
<p>"The released images already show extraordinary flaring behavior of distant active galaxies," Johnson said. "Closer to home, the images illustrate gamma-ray pulsations from a neutron star, a topic of great interest to the UCSC group, which has long been developing tools for detection of new gamma-ray pulsars."</p>
<p>In the new image, gas and dust in the plane of the Milky Way glows in gamma rays thanks to collisions with accelerated nuclei called cosmic rays. The famous Crab Nebula and Vela pulsars also shine brightly at these wavelengths. These fast-spinning neutron stars, which form when massive stars die, were originally discovered by their radio emissions. The image's third pulsar, named Geminga and located in Gemini, is not a radio source and was discovered by an earlier gamma-ray satellite. Fermi is expected to discover many more radio-quiet pulsars, providing key information about how these exotic objects work.</p>
<p>A fourth bright spot in the LAT image lies some 7.1 billion light-years away, far beyond our galaxy. This is 3C 454.3 in Pegasus, a type of active galaxy called a blazar. It's now undergoing a flaring episode that makes it especially bright.</p>
<p>The LAT scans the entire sky every 3 hours when operating in survey mode, which will occupy most of the telescope's observing time during the first year of operations. These fast snapshots will let scientists monitor rapidly changing sources.</p>
<p>The instrument detects photons with energies ranging from 20 million electron volts to over 300 billion electron volts. The high end of this range, which corresponds to energies more than 5 million times greater than dental x-rays, is little explored.</p>
<p>The spacecraft's secondary instrument, the GBM, spotted 31 gamma-ray bursts in its first month of operation. These high-energy blasts occur when massive stars die or when orbiting neutron stars spiral together and merge.</p>
<p>"Our job is to see the whole sky and identify burst locations well enough to tell the LAT where to look," says Charles Meegan, GBM's principal investigator at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. "We're operational now, and as time goes on we'll get even better by reducing errors in the location measurement."</p>
<p>The GBM is sensitive to less energetic gamma rays (8,000 to 30 million electron volts) than LAT. Bursts seen by both instruments will provide an unprecedented look across a broad gamma-ray spectrum, enabling scientists to peer into the processes powering these events.</p>
<p>NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is an astrophysics and particle physics partnership, developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, along with important contributions from academic institutions and partners in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the U.S.</p>

Environmental toxins</p><p>Medical advances depend on discoveries in areas such as genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, toxicology, and engineering. In these areas, UCSC has built strong programs and established an impressive record of accomplishments.</p><p>An <b>artificial retina</b> to restore sight to the blind, now in clinical trials, was developed by UCSC electrical engineers and their collaborators.</p><p>An optical <b>glucose sensor</b> created in a UCSC biochemistry lab is being used to develop a system for continuous monitoring of blood-sugar levels in diabetics and hospitalized patients.</p><p>Groundbreaking research by UCSC scientists has revealed the structure of the molecular machines that make proteins, a discovery now being used to develop <b>new antibiotics</b> to fight drug-resistant infections.</p><p>In a recent survey of published research in molecular biology and genetics, two UCSC scientists ranked among the <b>top ten authors</b> with the most high-impact papers in this area.</p><p><b>Human Genome Project</b></p><p>UCSC researchers played a crucial role in the international Human Genome Project, assembling the finished human genome sequence and making it publicly available to researchers worldwide through the UCSC Genome Browser. This web-based browser is now a valuable tool used by biomedical researchers throughout the world. UCSC researchers in a variety of disciplines are deeply involved in efforts to use the information encoded in the human genome sequence to transform the practice of medicine and our understanding of biology.</p><p><b>Environmental health hazards</b></p><p>UCSC environmental toxicologists are among the world's leading investigators of trace metals (such as lead and mercury) and their impacts on people and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California State Water Resources Control Board, and the California Attorney General's Office all work with UCSC toxicologists to set regulations and investigate possible health hazards.</p><p><b>Basic research</b></p><p>Understanding the basic biological processes involved in human diseases is an essential step in developing new ways to prevent and treat them. Often, biologists can study these fundamental processes in the test tube using stem cells or other cell cultures or in simple organisms, such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Other studies require the use of animals more closely related to humans, such as mice and rats. Fruit flies don't have mammary glands, for example, so mice are often used for research on breast cancer.</p><p>The use of animals in research, at UCSC and elsewhere, is strictly regulated to ensure that the studies are justified and the animals are treated humanely. Oversight of animal research at UCSC involves multiple mechanisms, including regulations and policies at the federal, state, university-wide, and campus levels, as well as regular inspections of research facilities.</p><p><b>Major funding</b></p><p>Much of the funding for health-related research comes from the National Institutes of Health, which provides more than $15 million annually in grants to UCSC researchers.</p><p>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), meanwhile, has provided $16.5 million to fund the campus's growing stem cell research program.</p><p>Other funding sources include:</p><p>   . American Cancer Society</p><p>   . March of Dimes</p><p>   . Howard Hughes Medical Institute</p><p>   . Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</p><p>   . Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences</p><p>   . Searle Scholars Program</p><p>UCSC's ability attract major funding from prestigious, highly-competitive, peer-reviewed grant programs is a testament to the quality of its health sciences faculty and their ongoing research programs.</p><p><b>Teaching and training</b></p><p>UCSC has created a comprehensive and innovative health sciences major to prepare students for careers in medicine. Established in 2003 and administered by the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, the health sciences program is the campus's fastest growing major and among its most popular.</p><p>Enrollment has grown to 640 students in four years.</p><p>Designed with California's health care needs in mind, the program requires students to become proficient in Spanish and to do an internship in a community health care setting. The health sciences major complements the health-related research programs at UCSC. These successful programs benefit students, the state of California, and the world at large.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2724f738072704601a012ff13e12d6d"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625654119</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625654119</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2724f738072704601a012ff13e12d6d"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/08/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625654119</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625654119</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
