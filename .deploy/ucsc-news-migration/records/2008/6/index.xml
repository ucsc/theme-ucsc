The event, in its third year, celebrates gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender diversity.</p><p>Weisberg was one of 20 family law professors who joined an "amicus" brief submitted to the California Supreme Court in the gay marriage case that the court decided in May. An amicus brief, written by persons or groups who advocate a position, can provide valuable perspectives to help a court reach its opinion. The brief Weisberg joined was authored by Professors Herma Kay of UC Berkeley School of Law and Michael Wald of Stanford Law School.</p><p>Because of her role in the case, Weisberg participated as one of two keynote speakers at the Kresge College event; Reverend Deborah Johnson, a featured speaker at the event, also discussed the recent court ruling.</p><p>Johnson is the founder and president of both the Motivational Institute, an organizational development consulting firm specializing in cultural diversity, and Inner Light Ministries, an omnifaith spiritual community of approximately 1,500 people in Soquel.</p><p>"I was honored to speak on the meaning of the gay marriage case," said Weisberg, whose remarks addressed the case's broader implications and drew parallels between discrimination based on race and sexual orientation.</p><p>Kresge Presents Pride also featured performances by student dance group Khaotic Bliss, student a cappella group Acquire, and student poetry group the Kinetic Poetics. A day-long gathering, this year's Pride event enabled hundreds of students to celebrate together, said Kresge organizer Chris Yang. A campuswide march kicked off the event.</p><p>Also in attendance on Saturday were Student Affairs vice chancellor Felicia McGinty and SA leadership members Alma Sifuentes and Jean Marie Scott.</p><p>For more information, please visit the Pride web site at <a href="http://kresge.ucsc.edu/pride">kresge.ucsc.edu/pride</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91570ca18072704601a012ff27c1a6a8"><name>2257</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus provost gives early outline of budget cuts</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will need to cut between $7 million and $12.3 million from its 2008-2009 budget, Campus Provost and Executive Vice chancellor Dave Kliger told the Academic Senate Friday.</summary><author>Guy Lasnier (831) 459-2955; lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>kliger, blumenthal, budget, zavella, faculty research lecture</keywords><description>UC Santa Cruz will need to cut between $7 million and $12.3 million from its 2008-2009 budget, Campus Provost and Executive Vice chancellor Dave Kliger told the Academic Senate Friday.</description><start-date>1212390000000</start-date><display-name>Campus provost gives early...</display-name><path>/2008/06/2257</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/06/2257</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338655316</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338655316</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/06/images/blumenthal.academic.senate.5.30.08.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/06/images/blumenthal.academic.senate.5.30.08.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blumenthal.academic.senate.5.30.08.300.jpg</name><file-size>18744</file-size><width>300</width><height>195</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor George Blumenthal addresses the Academic Senate Friday, May 30. (Photo by Guy Lasnier)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will need to cut between $7 million and $12.3 million from its 2008-2009 budget, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Dave Kliger told the Academic Senate Friday.</p>
<p>The low end is based on Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's revised May budget that restored $98.5 million from earlier proposed cuts. That budget would still reduce UC's budget by $234 million, Kliger said.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the exact number could extend into summer depending on when the state finalizes UC funding, Kliger said. "We don't yet know how the Regents and the Office of the President will respond. But there is one thing that we know for certain--we must plan for cuts and move forward with some actions and not simply wait."</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal noted that he and other college and university leaders have been lobbying the governor and legislature to maintain investment in higher education. And he spoke of continuing to move forward for a comprehensive fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Academic Senate Chair Quentin Williams noted that "external sources of funding become more important."</p>
<p>Kliger said that despite the inevitable need to cut he wants to continue to invest in four areas: competitive salaries, large-scale computer capacity, infrastructure for a capital campaign, and expansion of research efforts in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>With a unanimous vote and a standing ovation, the Academic Senate approved the nomination of Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latino Studies, to deliver the 2008-2009 Faculty Research Lecture.</p>
<p>The annual selection is a high honor as the nomination and vote come from one's colleagues. In its nomination, the Committee on the Faculty Research Lecture said Professor Zavella, who chairs the department, "is at the forefront of setting the research agenda on Latinos.</p>
<p>"Her groundbreaking work is widely respected for building the interdisciplinary and transnational agendas of anthropology, feminist studies, Latin American and Latino Studies and Chicano/a studies," the committee's nominating letter stated.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Zavella accepted on behalf of her department a Chancellor's Award for Achievements in Diversity.</p>

<p>The Lolland California Renewable Energies (LoCal-RE) program is an international collaboration involving three UC campuses--Santa Cruz, Davis, and Merced--and Denmark's Roskilde University and Technical University of Denmark. About 20 UC students and 20 Danish students, both undergraduates and graduates, will take part this summer.</p>
<p>The students will visit communities in Lolland, where a variety of renewable energy sources are being used, and they will work with experts to study these projects. Such hands-on, project-based learning will give them a better grasp of the complexities involved in the global push to shift from fossil fuels to sustainable and renewable forms of energy, said program organizer Ali Shakouri, a professor of electrical engineering in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>"We teach theoretical concepts of renewable energy devices and sources in our classes at UCSC," Shakouri said. "But our best demonstrations involve, for example, only small solar cells that students can purchase from RadioShack. So they understand the fundamentals, but they don't get a feeling for renewable energy's real-scale implementation."</p>
<p>Concerns over the impacts of fossil fuel consumption on climate and the environment are driving current interest in renewable energy sources. Lolland, a municipality south of Copenhagen, is at the forefront of developing and implementing renewable energy and has signed a "green partnership resolution" with the City of Santa Cruz. Lolland Mayor Stig Vestergaard came to UCSC last year as part of a delegation visiting the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>Lolland's projects include large-scale facilities such as the Nysted Offshore Wind Farm (the world's largest), the Vestas Wind Systems blade factory, as well as "community test beds" for renewable energy sources that don't yet exist commercially. For instance, researchers at the Hydrogen Community on Lolland recently completed a project using wind power to generate hydrogen gas and pump it through pipes into several houses. They then used another device to convert hydrogen in these houses to electricity and heat.</p>
<p>"This is not the type of project where you can do a one-time demonstration and show that it works, that the problem is solved," said Shakouri. "It's still too expensive, and the flammability of hydrogen is a concern. At Lolland, we'll be able to study the data they collect over the years and see how these problems might eventually be solved."</p>
<p>Bioenergy plants are also a big feature in Lolland. Corn and other energy crops are distilled to produce alcohol, which can then be added to conventional gas to make "gasohol." Adding vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, to regular diesel (a byproduct of petroleum) produces biodiesel. Methane from animal waste, such as cow manure, can also be used as a fuel.</p>
<p>"It's about burning organic products like plants, instead of fossil fuels," Shakouri explained. "You'll still generate carbon dioxide, but when that plant was growing, it absorbed the same amount of carbon; so burning it doesn't cause a net change in the atmosphere."</p>
<p>As with hydrogen, however, bioenergy has its own problems, chief among them the impact on world food supplies of using crops for fuel. Even wind energy has its problems; some wind farms kill significant numbers of birds such as eagles and hawks, which collide with the blades of wind turbines.</p>
<p>"The overriding principle here is that there's no free lunch," said Shakouri. "So we emphasize the drawbacks, as well as the strengths, of each renewable energy technology."</p>
<p>Shakouri will be joining the students in Denmark this summer as one of five members of the program's teaching staff. The others include Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering at UCSC, Bryan Jenkins, professor of biological and agricultural engineering at UC Davis, and two faculty members from the participating Danish universities.</p>
<p>Shakouri studies thermoelectric devices based on metals and semiconductors that directly convert heat into electricity; he's working to find new materials that will increase their efficiency. These materials are called "nanocomposites," as they involve the mixing and manipulation of matter at the atomic scale through nanotechnology. Shakouri heads the Thermionic Energy Conversion Center, which includes 12 research groups from seven U.S. universities, all focused on the goal of making new metal-semiconductor nanocomposites.</p>
<p>Eight of the U.S. students participating in LoCal-RE this summer hail from UCSC. They all did well in Shakouri's "Renewable Energy Sources" course and were selected on the strength of their application essays. Daniel O'Leary, a graduate student in computer engineering, said he looks forward to meeting European researchers in the field of renewable energies. He will also be looking for ideas for a renewable energy lab class he is developing with Shakouri and Kubby at UCSC.</p>
<p>Lara Hale, an undergraduate majoring in environmental studies and biology, applied for the program in order to visit Lolland's renewable energy sites and interact with a local community that has become energy independent. The best way to learn about renewable energy's potential applications, she wrote, is "to see them with my own eyes."</p>
<p>"The one thing I want to leave Denmark with is optimism--the belief that we can do it, too, and that sustainability is more than a pipedream; it's a reality at our fingertips if we just reach out and grab it," Hale said.</p>
<p>The other six UCSC students are Toshimi Barks, an undergraduate majoring in environmental studies; Tela Favaloro, a graduate student in electrical engineering; Mona Hammoudeh, an undergraduate majoring in environmental studies with economics; Jeremy Hieb, a graduate student in electrical engineering; Philip Jackson, an undergraduate majoring in physics; and Juan Pasqua, an undergraduate majoring in civil engineering.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer program, each student will write one chapter of a final research report covering analyses of renewable energy problems, solutions from Lolland that might be useful in their home communities, and recommendations for the future. Shakouri and the other participating faculty members are also discussing the potential for graduate-level exchange programs between universities in Denmark and California, along with internship opportunities at various renewable energy companies.</p>
<p>Next year, LoCal-RE will be held on U.S. soil; students will spend two weeks at UCSC and another two at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. According to Shakouri, California is of great interest to Danish researchers as a state with some of the most progressive laws for increasing the use of renewable energy and for encouraging sustainable development. The state is also home to many innovative start-up companies in green technologies, he said.</p>
<p>"Scientists should be aware of the social aspects of implementing new technology," Shakouri stressed. "I think if we focus only on making better solar cells, better engines.that alone won't solve the energy problem. People will have to change their way of life, which isn't easy."</p>

Blumenthal was inaugurated as the 10th chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, in a public ceremony on UCSC's East Field today (June 6, 2008).</p>
<p>Presided over by Richard C. Blum, chair of the University of California Board of Regents, the 75-minute ceremony featured a traditional academic procession; remarks by UCSC alumni Kent Nagano, Reyna Grande, and Gary Novack; a formal installation by UC President Robert C. Dynes; and Chancellor Blumenthal's inaugural address.</p>
<p>The inauguration was scheduled for June 6 to complement and call attention to the University's annual Student Achievement Awards; the awards ceremony began at 3 p.m. today in the same venue.</p>
<p>Nagano, music director of the Orchestre Symphonique de MontrÃ©al and the Bavarian State Opera; Grande, author of <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> and the 2007 American Book Award winner; and Novack, founder of the consulting company Pharmalogic Development, offered keynote addresses. Each described how their UCSC education placed them on paths to make important contributions to society.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's inaugural address highlighted UCSC's distinctiveness as a major teaching and research university and outlined his vision for the campus.</p>
<p>Others who participated in the inaugural ceremony included John Laird, a UCSC alumnus who represents Santa Cruz and the rest of the 27th District in California's Assembly; Ryan Coonerty, mayor of the City of Santa Cruz; Gordon Ringold, an alumnus and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who serves as president of the UCSC Foundation; Larry Vanderhoef, chancellor of UC Davis; and Michael Brown, chair of the UC Academic Senate.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,000 guests attended the public ceremony, which was held in a temporary pavilion on East Field. The Student Achievement Awards ceremony and several commencements the following weekend will also take place there.</p>
<p>The ceremony will also be webcast during the weekend of June 7-8 on the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">UCSC home page</a>.</p>
<p>Blumenthal, a distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics, came to UCSC as a faculty member in 1972. A former chair of the UC systemwide and UCSC Academic Senate, Blumenthal was appointed chancellor last fall.</p>
<p>His appointment culminated a five-month, nationwide search that attracted more than 550 candidates. Blumenthal had served as acting chancellor for 14 months prior to his formal appointment by the UC Regents on September 19, 2007.</p>

The previous policy allowed for two courtesy voids per fiscal year, which were processed at no charge.</p>
<p>The reason? Budget cuts.</p>
<p>"We're the only campus that offers two free courtesy voids," said Elisabet Hiatt, business manager for the UCSC Police Department. "Most UCs allow one dismissal, but they charge an administration fee. We're basically doing what the majority of other campuses are doing. We'll be more standard now."</p>
<p>Not only will UCSC need to cut $7 million to $12.3 million from its 2008-2009 budget because of state budget cuts, but Parking Enforcement revenue has decreased commensurate with available parking space inventory, said Hiatt.</p>
<p>A citation for a display violation, after the one courtesy void per fiscal year, costs $25.</p>
<p>All parking fine funds go to paying for salaries and equipment for the campus's five parking officers, said Hiatt.</p>
<p>Transportation and Parking Services plans to send a letter to permit holders soon that explains the policy change and includes a clear plastic sleeve that attaches to a car windshield and allows users to slip a parking permit in and out.</p>

The most recent contribution comes from an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose calculations have shown how the regular orbits of the planets could go haywire at some point in the far distant future.</p>
<p>The probability of this happening is small, however, and it can't happen for at least several hundred million years. "It's nothing to stay up at night and worry about," said Konstantin Batygin, who will graduate from UCSC in June with a bachelor's degree in astrophysics.</p>
<p>Batygin got started on the project two years ago with the help of Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. Their findings will soon be published in a leading scientific periodical (the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>) and have already been covered in popular magazines such as <em>New Scientist</em> and <em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em>.</p>
<p>"I had a good time working on this," Batygin said. "It's an honor just to be thinking about the same problem that was tackled by people like Newton and Laplace. Of course, I'm nowhere near those guys."</p>
<p>Given his background, however, it is perhaps not surprising that Batygin is already making contributions to the field. The son of a physicist, he decided at the age of 8 that he would become a physicist himself. That was the same year his family moved from his native Russia to Japan, where his father worked at a Japanese research institute. Placed in a Japanese elementary school, Batygin spent the first few months not understanding a word that was said in the classroom. But he soon learned to speak Japanese.</p>
<p>"We left Japan when I was in middle school, so I can only speak fluently about the kinds of things that mattered to me then. I can talk about Pokemon in Japanese, but not physics," he said.</p>
<p>From Tokyo, his family moved to Morgan Hill, south of San Jose. Batygin said he knew he wanted to go to UCSC after his first visit to campus. "The campus is awesome, and it just felt like the right place for me," he said.</p>
<p>For his undergraduate research project, Batygin used computers to run numerical calculations of the planetary motions. Starting with the solar system in its current configuration, the computer can evolve the system for millions of years into the future. Beyond about 50 million years, however, it is impossible to predict exactly how the solar system will evolve. With the gravitational forces of so many planets interacting as they orbit the Sun, the system is inherently chaotic and unpredictable.</p>
<p>"Poincar&#233; showed in the late 1800s that even if there are just two planets orbiting a star, there is no perfect analytic solution for their orbits," Laughlin said. "That was the first indication of what became chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics."</p>
<p>The slightest difference in the starting position of one planet can translate into enormously different configurations after millions of years, and it is impossible to measure the positions of the planets with enough precision to avoid that uncertainty.</p>
<p>In order to explore the possible future trajectories for the solar system, Batygin and Laughlin used a technique developed by a French researcher, Jacques Laskar. Their results confirmed Laskar's finding that Mercury is particularly prone to eccentric behavior. In one of Batygin's experiments, Mercury veered into a collision course with Venus after about 861 million years. Mars also got into trouble and was ejected from the solar system in 822 million years.</p>
<p>"If you wait long enough, the planets will eventually find themselves on crossing orbits, leading to close encounters, ejections, and collisions," Laughlin said. "This study gives an explicit demonstration and a mathematical explanation for what makes this happen. It's a very significant advance in a field that has interested astronomers and mathematicians for over 300 years."</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Batygin and Laughlin, however, Laskar had also been working on the same problem. Although he used a different method, he came up with essentially the same results and published them two weeks ahead of the UCSC researchers. So priority and the right to claim the discovery goes to Laskar, although the two studies provide complementary information and stronger evidence than either study by itself.</p>
<p>"At least we know we solved it correctly," Batygin said.</p>
<p>Batygin is currently working with Laughlin on another project, this one involving the search for planets around other stars far beyond our solar system. In the fall, he plans to begin graduate studies in planetary science at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</p>

Blumenthal with Dynes. (Photos by Terry Way)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A heady feeling of optimism seemed to run as high as the ceiling of the enormous pavilion erected on UCSC's East Field for the inauguration Friday of George Blumenthal as UCSC's 10th chancellor.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's formal installment as chancellor should have happened two years ago, quipped UC President Robert Dynes, who performed the official investiture near the close of the ceremony. Blumenthal served as acting chancellor for 14 months prior to his permanent appointment by UC Regents last fall.</p>
<p>"From his first hour as a campus temp, George showed visionary leadership," Dynes said.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which drew a crowd of 1,000, was presided over by Richard C. Blum, chair of the University of California Board of Regents, and featured a traditional academic procession, Chancellor Blumenthal's inaugural address, and musical performances.</p>
<p>There were also remarks by UCSC alumni:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kent Nagano, music director of the Orchestre Symphonique de MontrÃ©al and the Bavarian State Opera;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Reyna Grande, author of <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> and the 2007 American Book Award winner; <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>and Gary Novack, founder of the consulting company Pharmalogic Development.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Each described how their UCSC education placed them on paths to make important contributions to society.</p>
<p>Guests arrived via special event buses and walked across the green field to the large white pavilion, which gleamed under blue skies and warm sunshine.</p>
<p>"Whenever we have a new chancellor for the university, it's a major event," said attendee and Shakespeare Santa Cruz board member Darrell Darling of Santa Cruz while walking in with wife Karen. "We're especially enthused about George Blumenthal because he's local, he's a terrific people person, and he has academic excellence."</p>
<p>Blumenthal, a distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics, came to UCSC as a faculty member in 1972. A former chair of the UC systemwide and UCSC Academic Senate, he was appointed chancellor after a five-month, nationwide search that attracted more than 550 candidates.</p>
<p>Speaker after speaker at Friday's event detailed Blumenthal's dedication to UCSC, remarking on his deep knowledge of campus values, his commitment to diversity, his personal accessibility, and his devotion to soothing town-gown strains.</p>
<p>"Everyone likes to work with George, even the Santa Cruz City Council," joked Blum.</p>
<p>In fact, the City Council liked Blumenthal so much, it wanted to publicly express its support for him, said Santa Cruz Mayor Ryan Coonerty, who is also a UCSC lecturer in legal studies. But considering a history of friction on certain issues between the city and the campus, the council thought perhaps its backing could hurt Blumenthal's prospects, Coonerty said. It decided to take a strategic, quiet role in advocating for Blumenthal's permanent appointment as chancellor.</p>
<p>"This was no small task, as the Santa Cruz City Council has never been strategic nor quiet," he said to audience laughter.</p>
<p>Coonerty then proclaimed June 6, 2008, as "George Blumenthal Day" in the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's history and involvement on campus are what make the community enthusiastic about his taking the reins, said Assemblyman and UCSC alum John Laird.</p>
<p>"That is what is exciting," said Laird. "That it is George, someone who's been a neighbor and a scholar and a teacher."</p>
<p>Blumenthal is "as far from an administrative hired gun as one can get," added Quentin Williams, chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. "He knows us because he <em>is</em> us."</p>
<p>Blumenthal is the first UCSC chancellor to rise up through the faculty ranks, noted Blum.</p>
<p>Speakers detailed examples of how the chancellor listened to them when they came to talk to him, even if he wasn't well versed on the topic.</p>
<p>A loud protest held by a few hundred members of public employee and health care workers union AFSCME, which has been negotiating with UC officials for better contracts for 20,000 systemwide workers, briefly passed by the inaugural ceremony but did not interrupt the proceedings. Protestors also chanted and toted signs for a short time outside rope lines at the outdoor reception following the inauguration.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's inaugural address highlighted UCSC's distinctiveness as a major teaching and research university and outlined his vision for the campus.</p>
<p>"We developed a restless need to anticipate and innovate . We created new academic formulas. We pioneered interdisciplinary studies, long before it became a catchword. We embraced rigorous independent study, student-designed course work and majors. We personalized education with narrative evaluations," Blumenthal said. "We attracted a student body that grew to include young men and women ever more diverse ethnically, economically, and culturally."</p>
<p>Among his goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be a top-ranked research university, and the best public university for the quality of the education it provides students. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>To give UCSC undergraduates the knowledge and intellectual tools to prepare them for the world they will live and work in. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>To re-assert the prominence of the colleges in the campus's academic life. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>To give more undergraduates the opportunity to be actively involved in research and advanced critical study.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>To grow UCSC's graduate student population, which is already happening. New graduate enrollments this fall will be up 17 percent.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>To expand professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"And there may be others. There may be opportunities we can't yet see over that horizon," Blumenthal said. "So we will continue looking, as our mandate asks."</p>
<p>The inauguration was scheduled for June 6 to complement and call attention to the University's annual <a href="%20http://www.ucsc.edu/students/achievement_week/08/">Student Achievement Awards</a>, which took place later that day in the same venue. Several commencements the following weekend will also take place there.</p>

<p>The ceremony capped <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/students/achievement_week/08/">Student Achievement Week</a>, an annual showcase of undergraduate research, artwork, and performances. This year, the awards ceremony took place in a temporary East Field pavilion, which hours earlier on Friday served as the site of the inauguration of Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>UCSC alumnus Loren Steck was on hand to present the Steck Award, honoring the year's best senior thesis. Presentation of the Deans' and Chancellor's Awards was made by the leaders of each academic division.</p>
<p>The event included a welcome by Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger; William Ladusaw, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, served as emcee.</p>
<p>Awards and scholarships included:</p>
<p><strong>Loren Steck Award</strong>. The Loren Steck Award honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. Konstantin Batygin was selected for his thesis, "The Dynamical Stability of the Solar System." His faculty adviser is Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics. (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2268">See related story</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Deans' and Chancellor's Awards</strong>. These awards recognize outstanding achievements by undergraduate students. Ten Deans' Awards are awarded to students within each division (Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Social Sciences). Of those students, up to three in each division can be selected to receive a Chancellor's Award. Students as well as their mentors were recognized at the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>Strauss Award</strong>. Each year, the Strauss Scholarships fund at least 14 public-service projects proposed by college juniors in California. The late Donald Strauss of Newport Beach demonstrated a strong commitment to public service. His widow, Dorothy M. R. Strauss, established the foundation in 1997 as a tribute to her husband. This year's Strauss Award winner, Lillian Wilson, will be working with the Ella Baker Center in Oakland on their newest initiative "Green Collar Jobs Campaign." The campaign plans to roll out a national model that will help 250,000 disadvantaged Americans out of poverty by creating jobs installing solar panels, making biofuels, and glazing windows to make them more efficient. More workers are needed in these areas, and therefore have the potential to create net new jobs for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship</strong>. Professor emeritus of biology at UCSC Kenneth Thimann and his wife, Ann (both now deceased), established this pledge of support to UCSC in recognition of future UCSC graduate science scholars. The scholarship award of $2,000 is intended for use in graduate studies. Scholarships were awarded to chemistry major, Katherine Nelson, and to Jedediah Pixely majoring in both Physics and Mathematics.</p>

UC Santa Cruz received a "Statement of Intent to Register" from 4,573 prospective freshmen by the May 1 deadline, according to systemwide SIR numbers released today by the University of California.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Actual freshmen enrollments at UCSC this fall are expected to be between 3,700 and 3,850, campus admissions officials estimate.</p>
<p>"We are excited to welcome the Class of 2012 to the University of California, Santa Cruz, and we're very gratified by the strong interest they have shown in our campus," said Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The upward trajectory in our enrollment numbers affirms that UCSC is being recognized for top-quality teaching and unparalleled opportunities for undergraduates to participate in cutting-edge UC research."</p>
<p>UC also today released enrollment projections for community college students who have been admitted to UC's nine general campuses. UCSC has admitted 3,275 transfer students from community colleges throughout California, an increase of more than 200 from the previous year. UCSC expects to enroll between 850 and 950 transfer students this fall.</p>
<p>At UCSC, the numbers in this year's freshman admissions cycle reflect the campus's increasing popularity:</p>

<ul>
<li>In January, officials announced that more high school seniors than ever applied to UCSC for fall 2008, a one-year increase of 13.8 percent in freshman applications, compared to a 9.2 percent increase for UC systemwide. During the university's "priority filing" period last November, a total of 27,810 prospective freshmen applied to UC Santa Cruz, compared with 24,436 a year earlier.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>UCSC's admission rate dropped 7 percent for fall 2008, compared to 2007. "In the course of one year, that's a significant reduction, reflecting our increasing selectivity," says Michael McCawley, acting director of admissions at UCSC.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>McCawley said the academic profile of the incoming freshman class also increased, both in average GPA and standardized test scores.</p>
<p>UCSC's incoming class of frosh also will be the most ethnically diverse in its 44-year history, more closely reflecting the demographics of California. "Chicano and Latino students, for example, comprise 20 percent of the entire class, up from 18 percent a year ago," McCawley noted.</p>
<p>McCawley said UCSC's admissions officers had sensed increasing excitement about UCSC before the final numbers were tallied. "In the weeks leading up to the SIR deadline this spring, interest in our campus seemed very high. We heard this from many of the thousands of students and families who visited the campus; we also heard it from high school counselors, who often reflect student interest in a campus," he said.</p>
<p>Admissions receptions featuring Chancellor Blumenthal also helped get the word out about UC Santa Cruz, McCawley said. "We saw SIR increases from each of the regions of California where we held receptions."</p>
<p>McCawley says several factors explain the difference between the number of SIRs submitted and the estimated class size: some students accept offers of admission at multiple universities; economic factors, including increasing student fees, may preclude some students from enrolling; and some students do not fulfill all the conditions of their admission, including academic performance in their senior year of high school.</p>

<p>Students from associate linguistics professor Beth Ann Hockey's <em>Language Engineering</em> class showed visitors how to make robots move with the sound of their voice, learn English through immersion in a virtual world, and use a telephone reminder system to manage school tasks and aid in memory retention.</p>
<p>"The students used the same Open Source tool kit to build their projects that we used to build the Clarissa system for the space station," said Hockey-who led the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/02-19/nasa.asp">Clarissa Project at NASA</a>, which developed the first spoken dialogue system ever used in space. The technology allows astronauts to have their hands and eyes free to concentrate on completing tasks in space, which are more complicated due to zero gravity.</p>
<p>Hockey said that although her students all had a solid background in linguistics, many of them began her class with no experience in computer programming. She noted that the students were given the opportunity to work with academic and commercial partners who volunteered their time to assist.</p>
<p>The partners included Chris Kitts, a professor at Santa Clara University and director of the Center for Robotic Exploration and Space Technologies (CREST) at NASA's Research Park; Sunil Vermuri of Q-Tech, which is known for its voice-based telephone reminder system; and Matthew Fuchs of Paideia's virtual language learning program.</p>
<p>Hockey's <em>Language Engineering</em> is the only class of its type offered at UCSC. The course is designed to give students the opportunity to learn computational linguistics-the study of building computer programs to use natural language. This is the second time Hockey has taught the class, and this marks the first year that students were able to create dialogue systems in collaboration with project partners.</p>
<p>Attendees at the demo included Anthony Shore, an alumnus who graduated from UCSC in 1990 with a B.A. in linguistics. Shore now works for the San Francisco branding agency Landor Associates. "We're actually using linguistics in the world for business applications," Shore noted. "I'm here to tell the students that there's life after receiving a linguistics degree; I've found that studying linguistics at UCSC has been absolutely invaluable for my career."</p>

The goal? To learn firsthand about the challenges facing U.S. manufacturing today, including how to reduce energy usage, consumption of raw materials, and pollution while competing in fierce markets with China and other developing nations.</p><p>And learn they did. </p><p>"It's a whole different level of learning to actually go there and to apply what we'd written about to things we were seeing," said Nicole Nakagawa. "To learn about policy from industry leaders--that's something you can't get out of a book."</p><p>Press, chair of the Environmental Studies Department, selected 11 undergraduates for the senior seminar from among the highest-performing students in his National Environmental Policy class, which set the stage for the in-depth exploration of the steel, glass, aluminum, and pulp and paper industries. Students met with plant managers, corporate officials, union representatives, environmental regulators, and others as they explored the forces shaping U.S. industry. Students chose the topics of their term papers, and all agreed that the "field trips" took their understanding to new levels. </p><p>"When you sit in class and learn all the acronyms of environmental regulations, it's abstract," said John Prager, who is graduating with a combined major in environmental studies and economics. "But when you go out and see the mills and you see the three-story piece of machinery they installed to comply with air-quality regulations, and you hear that it cost $40 million to implement, well, it brings everything into the real world." </p><p>"It changed my view of environmental regulations. It seemed like they had more teeth, actually," added Prager.</p><p>In her final paper, Nakagawa analyzed the environmental implications of a new trend: U.S. companies are selling used industrial equipment to developing nations where regulations are less stringent, or perhaps nonexistent. Entire factories are being dismantled, transported, and reassembled overseas. "The biggest buyers are in Asia, Southeast Asia, South America, and Central America, but there's no oversight, so there's no way to track all of it," she said.</p><p>For many students, the class broadened their understanding of industry's contributions to environmental stewardship. They were impressed by state-of-the-art operations like a waste-reduction program at a paper-making facility in Wisconsin that transforms waste into a landscaping product while also capturing methane gas that is used to help power the facility. </p><p>"That was all completely their idea," noted Nakagawa. "We saw all these great ideas that weren't prompted by the need to comply with regulations. Their main motivation may not be environmental sensitivity, but it saves them a lot of money."</p><p>On another visit, a Pepsico manager made a strong case for building a plastics recycling facility in California--a development that would certainly enhance his company's bottom line but would also have enormous environmental benefits because the only recycling facilities now are on the East Coast and in China. "The carbon footprint of all those shipping miles is huge, and who knows what processes are used in China," said Nakagawa.</p><p>In her paper, graduating senior Hannah Buoye, who majored in literature and environmental studies, explored the relationship between industry and regulatory agencies. "They work more closely than I thought they did," she said. "Industry is going in the right direction by incorporating environmentalism into their business planning."</p><p>"It was amazing to see all the stuff I've read about, and to actually walk on the factory floor and interact with the people at the facility," she said. "It's the experience I've learned the most from, because what I was witnessing was enhanced by everything I've learned during the past four years. I have a whole new perspective. It was like going on a school field trip but ten times better."</p><p>Graduating senior Anthony Tomasello, majoring in environmental studies and economics, said the trip opened his eyes, too.</p><p>"Before this class, my ideas about manufacturing were skewed, I'd say. You really don't get a full sense of how much these people are trying to work on the environment and reduce pollution until you get out there and see the magnitude of some of these plants," said Tomasello. "You see how complex and intricate it is, and how many factors go into the calculus of trying to do business."</p><p>The class made a lasting impression on students on a purely sensory level, as well. Tomasello likened the tour of a steel mill in eastern Iowa to "the last scene of <i>Terminator 2</i>."</p><p>"Sparks were flying everywhere, it was dark, there was smoke, and all around were these vats of what looked like molten lava," he recalled. "You get a sense of how big and hot and heavy these things are when you're a little afraid for your safety."</p><p>Press, who had dreamed of offering the class for years, wanted to give students a multidimensional understanding of U.S. manufacturing that would help prepare them for the tough decisions they'll confront in the workplace, whether in industry, regulation, government, law, or a related field. A grant from the Henry Luce Foundation made it possible. Students visited factories in Iowa, Indiana, and Wisconsin, as well as Fresno and Hayward.</p><p>"This class was the culmination of my entire college career, and it has been great to have Daniel Press as a mentor," said Prager.</p><p>Nakagawa, who majored in environmental studies and biology, began working with Press as his research assistant last year. She and Press coauthored a chapter of a forthcoming book about open-space preservation, and she credits him with convincing her to go to graduate school. "He really has a passion to teach students everything he knows," she said. "Of all my professors, he's the most amazing." </p><p>For everyone, the trip to the Midwest was the highlight of the class. "Before the trip, I was under the impression that U.S. manufacturing was being outcompeted by China and India, and all the jobs were being outsourced," she said. "It was the most gratifying thing for me to see that American industry is still surviving, it's still thriving."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915732d78072704601a012ffd1158eb3"><name>2281</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EVC urged support for people affected by fire in Bonny Doon</title><start-date>1213254000000</start-date><display-name>EVC urged support for...</display-name><path>/2008/06/2281</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/06/2281</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338665121</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338665121</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As you presumably know, a wildfire in the Bonny Doon area northwest of campus has been burning since Wednesday afternoon.

McCabe.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Arboretum at UC Santa Cruz will institute new admission fees effective July 1, 2008. Admission will continue to be free for Arboretum members and UCSC students, and there will be one free Community Day each month. </p><p>The change is necessary to provide adequate funds for maintaining the plant collections and gardens, according to the Arboretum's development director Tad Sterling. The Arboretum features 120 acres of gardens and natural areas with spectacular views of the Monterey Bay and the largest collections of Australian and New Zealand plants outside of those countries. It contains significant collections of conifers and rare and extraordinary plants from California and South Africa.</p><p>The Arboretum has been supported primarily by donations, memberships, dedicated volunteers, grants, and contracts. Support from the University has accounted for 12 to 20 percent of the Arboretum's annual funding. Voluntary donation boxes have raised some support, but not enough to offset inflation and the costs of an increasing number of visitors.</p><p>"We are asking visitors to help share some of the costs of the visitor services they receive," Sterling explained.</p><p>Admission will continue to be free for school groups on field trips, and there will be no charge to access the areas and trails of the Arboretum outside of the main fences. The fees for commercial bus tours will be raised to match the new garden admission fees. </p><p>The changes came about after a long organizational-effectiveness planning process that compared the Arboretum with other public gardens and included input from hundreds of members of the public, Arboretum members, and the campus community. </p><p>"While we would prefer to have free admission, in the current economic conditions this is not possible," said Arboretum director Daniel Harder. "It would take a little over $100,000 per year in new donations to offset the costs of providing visitor services such as maps, signs, brochures, school tours, student weeders for the high visitor-use areas, answering phone questions, and maintaining clear paths." </p><p>Charging admission fees is one of several ways the Arboretum is working to meet the challenge of raising most of its operating and education budgets each year. It is also renting facilities for meetings and events, expanding publicity for the gift shop, and seeking sponsorships for events and garden projects. Casualties of the recent budget challenges include the cancellation of the popular Arboretum Music Series and a reduction in the number of students hired.</p><p>Arboretum admission fees as of July 1, 2008, are as follows:</p><p>   . $5 for adults</p><p>   . $2 for children (6 to 17 years old)</p><p>   . Free to children under 6 years old </p><p>   . Free to those going only to Norrie's Gift Shop</p><p>   . Free to Arboretum Associates members and Arboretum volunteers</p><p>   . Free to UCSC students</p><p>   . Free to members of the American Horticulture Society</p><p>   . Free on Community Day, the first Tuesday of each month.</p><p>Members of the Arboretum will now get in free at more than 100 gardens nationwide that participate in the American Horticulture Society Reciprocal Admissions program. A <a href="http://www.ahs.org/events/reciprocal_events.htm">list of participating gardens</a> is available online. Memberships are available for purchase at the Arboretum. </p><p>Norrie's Gift Shop is a volunteer-run store that gives all of its proceeds to the maintenance of the gardens and collections. Some of that funding supports student interns and student workers. Norrie's is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Christmas and Thanksgiving.

<p>Since then, the campus Housing Office has identified two contact phone numbers for employees displaced from housing by the fire:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employees may contact the Faculty and Staff Housing Office for assistance at (831) 458-3506.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>There may also be vacancies available at the University Inn &amp; Conference Center, at 611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz. The number there is (831) 426-7100.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In other fire-related news:</p>

<ul>
<li>The UCSC crew and engine that had been dispatched to the fire in Bonny Doon were released from that duty earlier today. The crew and engine have returned to campus.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The campus has been asked to provide temporary housing on Friday night and possibly Saturday night for approximately 50 firefighters currently assigned to the Martin Fire in Bonny Doon. The preliminary plan is to house these firefighters in recently vacated units at the Crown-Merrill Apartments. This request will result in a number of fire engines from various agencies driving onto campus tonight, and possibly staying Saturday night as well. The engines would be stationed on campus between the hours of 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. This activity is not expected to impact scheduled commencement activities, which will occur as planned. If you have any questions, please contact the campus Fire Department at 459-3473.</li>

The event takes place at the UC Santa Cruz Farm on Saturday, June 21 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>

She adds, "All flowers are lovely and all bouquets can be lovely too -- it's really about having fun with flowers."</p>
<p>Organically grown flowers from the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden will be provided, and participants are asked to bring a vase so that they can take home their creations.</p>

Rubin will receive a $240,000 award over four years to support his research on the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of cancer.</p>
<p>The Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, supports young investigators of outstanding promise in the basic and clinical sciences relevant to the advancement of human health. Nominations for the awards are invited from a limited number of institutions selected on the basis of the scope of their work in biomedical research.</p>
<p>Rubin is among 20 exceptional researchers chosen this year and the third UCSC faculty member to recieve this prestigious award. Previous UCSC recipients are Doug Kellogg, professor and chair of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology, and Hinrich Boeger, assistant professor of MCD biology, who won the award last year.</p>
<p>"The impressive number of UCSC faculty selected as Pew Scholars speaks to both the high quality of our faculty and the value of our uniquely interdisciplinary approach to basic science that advances human health," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Rubin studies the molecular processes that control cell division and how those processes go awry in cancer cells. In particular, he studies the control mechanism involving the retinoblastoma protein, which in normal cells serves as a molecular "gate" that keeps cells from proliferating until they receive the proper signals.</p>
<p>Understanding how these control mechanisms work requires a detailed molecular picture of the interactions between proteins and how those interactions are affected by modifications of protein structures. For example, the addition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) controls the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, opening the gate and allowing cell division to proceed.</p>
<p>"The opening of the gate by phosphorylation is highly upregulated in many cancers," Rubin said. "The retinoblastoma protein is named for the rare childhood eye tumor in which its gene was originally found mutated. Now the same protein is thought to be involved in a diverse set of tumors."</p>
<p>Rubin's lab uses powerful techniques such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the structures of protein complexes and to learn in molecular detail how structural changes and chemical modifications affect the biological functions of the proteins. Ultimately, this information may be used by pharmaceutical companies to design better drugs for fighting cancer.</p>
<p>The Pew Scholars selection process is rigorously competitive, as all applicants are highly talented researchers in their fields. Applicants must be nominated by an invited institution and must demonstrate excellence and innovation in their research. This year, 149 institutions were invited to nominate a candidate in basic biomedical research, and 117 eligible nominations were received. The scholars are selected by a distinguished national advisory committee, chaired by Torsten Wiesel, president emeritus of Rockefeller University and a 1981 Nobel laureate.</p>

Known as marine bycatch, this problem is an ongoing challenge to the fishing industry, regulatory agencies, and conservationists. One recent proposal would compensate for bycatch by reducing other impacts on affected species, but a new analysis suggests that this strategy could end up doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>A paper published last year in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</em> made the case for "compensatory mitigation" of fisheries bycatch, using seabird deaths caused by a longline fishery as an example. The authors suggested that eradicating rats from an island with seabird nesting colonies could have more benefits for a population of shearwaters than efforts to reduce bycatch in the longline fishery.</p>
<p>A number of seabird experts, however, were skeptical of the paper's findings. Given its potential influence on fishery policies, they decided the proposal warranted a careful evaluation.</p>
<p>"There are so many complexities involved in fisheries bycatch, we felt compelled to thoroughly examine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and establish the criteria that would have to be met for it to work," said Myra Finkelstein, a postdoctoral fellow in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Finkelstein is the lead author of a paper published June 18 in the journal <em>PLoS ONE</em> that evaluates the potential effectiveness of compensatory mitigation for marine bycatch. She worked with a dozen coauthors whose areas of expertise include seabird conservation and ecology, marine bycatch, and mathematical modeling of wildlife populations. The researchers concluded that compensatory mitigation could only rarely succeed in reducing or offsetting the effects of marine bycatch.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult to make this work," Finkelstein said. "Most of the species threatened by bycatch evolved to live long and reproduce slowly. When bycatch kills adults, these populations just aren't capable of making up for it through increased reproduction. It really is about the bycatch."</p>
<p>Another major stumbling block is that bycatch typically involves a large variety of nontarget species, whereas compensatory mitigation actions are likely to affect only one or a few of those species.</p>
<p>"Marine bycatch is not a single-species problem," Finkelstein said. "So many nontarget species are caught in a given fishery that mitigating the effects on one species could lead to a bigger impact on other species."</p>
<p>The researchers also found flaws in the case study of flesh-footed shearwaters used to support the compensatory mitigation strategy in the original paper. But the bulk of the new paper is devoted to a set of five criteria for evaluating any proposals to implement such strategies. The researchers found that compensatory mitigation for marine bycatch is likely to be successful only in a limited number of situations. In many cases, they said, it has the potential to accelerate declines of marine species currently threatened by fisheries bycatch.</p>
<p>"These are complicated situations. We have to be very cautious, especially with critically endangered species, before we adopt a policy that allows continued mortality from bycatch," Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>The coauthors of the paper include Victoria Bakker, William Satterthwaite, and Robert Henry of UCSC; Daniel Doak of the University of Wyoming; Ben Sullivan and John Croxall of the BirdLife International Global Seabird Programme; Rebecca Lewison of San Diego State University; Peter McIntyre of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Shaye Wolf of the Center for Biological Diversity; David Priddel of the Australian Department of Environment and Climate Change; Jennifer Arnold of Pennsylvania State University; and Paul Sievert of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p>

<p>National Internet Safety Month is an opportunity to increase awareness about the risks we and our families face on the Internet, and to promote information and resources to help us stay safe online.</p>
<p>Some important Internet safety tips from Information Technology Services (ITS) to keep in mind:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Always remember: The Internet is not private.</strong></p>
<p>Don't reveal personal details or confidential information online. Assume that anything you post online is public and could potentially be used against you. Help your family members understand this, as well. What they do online can affect your whole family.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Keep in mind that once you post something online, it can be very difficult to take it back.</strong> Even if you delete the information, copies can still exist on other computers, web sites, or in search engines.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Protect your personal information.</strong></p>
<p>Don't give out personal or sensitive information to anyone you don't know or who doesn't have a legitimate need for it. Also, be sure you are using a trusted, secure web page before entering personal or sensitive information online.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Protect your passwords.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure your passwords are complex and hard to guess, and keep your passwords secret. ITS staff will not ask you to tell them your password and neither should anyone else. See UCSC's <a href="http://security.ucsc.edu/policies/password.shtml">Password Standards</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>See the following ITS computer security tutorials for additional information:</strong></p>

<p>Now the campus can also boast that it has a tree-climbing champion.</p>
<p>Staff tree trimmer Jessica Petrini won the women's division of the Western Chapter International Society of Arboriculture Tree Climbing Championships, held June 13-15 in Elk Grove.</p>
<p>"I was totally amazed," said Petrini, 34, of her win. "But really, it was just icing on the cake for me, because regardless of the outcome, I learned so much."</p>
<p>Contestants competed in five timed events:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work climb: Contestants must climb to five stations in the tree, performing a different task at each station.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Aerial rescue: Contestants must reach and safely lower an injured climber (in this case, a life-sized mannequin).</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Throwline: Tests contestants' ability to accurately place lines in a tree at heights ranging from 40 to 60 feet.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Belayed speed climb: Contestants ascend a predetermined route from ground to about 60 feet.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Secured footlock: Measures climbers' ability to perform 40-foot vertical ascent using double-climbing line.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Petrini's supervisor, Roger Edberg, assistant superintendent of Grounds Services, said her win was exciting.</p>
<p>But, he said, "I wasn't too surprised. She's motivated and pretty tough."</p>
<p>Climbing speed isn't so much a factor for Grounds Services, but many of the skills involved in the competition carry over into the tree-trimming job, said Edberg.</p>
<p>Having won her chapter's competition, Petrini is now preparing for the organization-wide International Tree Climbing Championship, which will take place July 26-27 in St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p>She thinks the international meet will prove far more challenging than the regional one, where she competed against only two other women.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get smoked," Petrini laughed, while taking a break from trimming dead wood out of a coast live oak at Stevenson College on a recent weekday. "These women I'm going to be competing against in St. Louis are pretty much the who's-who in women's tree climbing."</p>
<p>There's a who's-who in women's tree climbing?</p>
<p>Indeed. Men have been competing in the event since it started in 1976, and women began in 2001.</p>
<p>The International Tree Climbing Championship was initially proposed in 1975 by Dick Alvarez of Atascadero, owner of Arbor Tree Surgery. Alvarez began running a number of events in his own company, with the intent to preserve classic tree-climbing skills. The competition grew as Alvarez invited other companies to attend his annual company picnic. Eventually, it became a chapter-sanctioned event.</p>
<p>This year's regional competition was the first Petrini had competed in, but she's been in the landscaping and tree-care field for quite awhile.</p>
<p>Her interest started in high school when she joined the Student Conservation Association, a nonprofit that offers conservation internships and summer trail crew opportunities to more than 3,000 people each year. She volunteered on a wilderness trail crew, then was hired onto a crew in Idaho.</p>
<p>She worked as a gardener at the University House from 2000-2006. But her goal is to become a registered consulting arborist with American Society of Consulting Arborists. To that end, in 2006 she earned an arborist certification, which requires passing a 200-question written exam. In 2007 she earned her tree-worker certification, for which she had to demonstrate climbing and knot-tying skills.</p>
<p>Mom to three boys--Venny, 9, Anthony, 6, and Niccolo, 4--Petrini also owns a landscaping maintenance business and an artificial lawn businesses with husband Wade.</p>
<p>She also serves on the board of the Central Coast Chapter of the California Landscape Contractors Association.</p>
<p>Petrini is one of four staff tree trimmers on the UCSC campus. Her colleagues are Stan Higgins, Dave Kapellas, and Sam Pumroy.</p>
<p>Tree crew operations include routine maintenance, safety trimming, emergency response, planting, and consulting with construction projects, according to Edberg.</p>
<p>The tree-trimmers maintain about 6,000 trees in the landscaped areas of campus, said Edberg, as well as provide varying levels of management in the more-wooded zones.</p>
<p>For Petrini, tree work is a labor of love, but also provides a certain level of job security.</p>
<p>"Trees are taken for granted," she said. "People depend on trees for shade, air quality, and food. There's always going to be the need for people who can consult and provide guidance on the best way to care for them."</p>

For Liu, a professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it was a major milestone in two decades of work on an artificial retina to restore vision to the blind.</p>
<p>Ten patients are now enrolled in a clinical trial of the device based on Liu's microchip at four leading ophthalmic centers in the United States. Patients are also enrolled in trials in Mexico, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Developed through a large collaborative effort involving biomedical researchers nationwide, the retinal prosthesis is an implantable electronic device intended for patients blinded by diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p>These diseases destroy the light receptors in the retina, but not the nerve fibers that connect the eye to the brain. The implanted microchip stimulates the neurons in the retina, relaying visual signals that are transmitted to the chip from a tiny video camera integrated into a pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>"This chip is very different from those seen in typical electronics because it is implanted in the body and directly interfaces with a human organ. There is very little margin for error in such a system," Liu said.</p>
<p>The chip is a core component of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System, produced by Second Sight Medical Products, the commercial partner of the Artificial Retina Project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science. Liu's work on the chip was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and later by DOE for further developments.</p>
<p>Liu's pioneering work on the retinal prosthesis began in 1988, when he teamed up with Dr. Mark Humayun, an ophthalmologist and bioengineer now at the University of Southern California. The DOE Artificial Retina consortium now coordinating the project involves three universities, six national laboratories, and a private company (Second Sight).</p>
<p>A first-generation device (Argus 16, also from Second Sight) delivered electrical impulses through an array of 16 electrodes attached to the retina. It was tested on six patients with retinitis pigmentosa between 2002 and 2004, giving them the ability to see patterns of light and dark, perceive motion, count discrete items, and locate and differentiate large objects in their environment. The second-generation Argus II features an array of 60 electrodes and other technological refinements. And Liu is already working on a third-generation device.</p>
<p>Although the Argus 16 delivered only 16 "pixels" of visual information, the remarkable plasticity of the human brain enabled patients to make sense of the signals from the implant and derive meaningful, if quite limited, perceptions of their environment. The Argus II is expected to provide patients with a rudimentary form of sight, better than the earlier version, yet still short of the ultimate goal. The dream that Liu and his collaborators are working toward is an implant that enables patients to move independently, recognize faces, and read large print.</p>
<p>The implanted electronic chip that drives the Argus II is a highly sophisticated system that balances size, power, and safety requirements to enable an electrical interface with the retina. Wireless transmission of power and data between the implant and the external video system eliminates any need for wires penetrating the skin, which would raise the risk of infections. The implant is about one-fourth the size of the first-generation device, while providing nearly four times as many electrodes to stimulate the retinal neurons.</p>
<p>"The development of this chip was a great challenge, but one that is fulfilling when you see the life-changing benefit it can have. I am proud of our work," Liu said, adding that the success of the project owes much to the foresight of agencies such as NSF, DOE, and the National Institutes of Health, which provided long-term funding for it.</p>
<p>The three-year clinical trial of the Argus II is the only long-term study of a retinal prosthesis currently under way anywhere in the world. Ten subjects have been recruited for Phase I of the trial at four leading ophthalmic centers in the United States. According to Second Sight, although it is too early to comment on the clinical data, each device continues to function as expected, and all participants are using their systems at home daily.</p>
<p>Liu's group is now designing the microelectronics and wireless link for the next-generation implants, which will be even smaller and more sophisticated, with more electrodes interfacing with the retina to provide higher resolution.</p>
<p>"Minimizing the size and power requirements of the implanted device, optimizing power delivery, and managing reliable communication and data transmission between implanted and external components are the major challenges," Liu said.</p>

One of the proposed explanations--a massive asteroid impact--now has strong support from computer simulations carried out by two groups of researchers. Planetary scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were involved in both studies, which appear in the June 26 issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>"It's a very old idea, but nobody had done the numerical calculations to see what would happen when a big asteroid hits Mars," said Francis Nimmo, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC and first author of one of the papers.</p>
<p>Nimmo's group found that such an impact could indeed produce the observed differences between the Martian hemispheres. The other study used a different approach and reached the same conclusion. Nimmo's paper also suggests testable predictions about the consequences of the impact.</p>
<p>The so-called hemispheric dichotomy was first observed by NASA's Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s. The Viking spacecraft revealed that the two halves of the planet look very different, with relatively young, low-lying plains in the north and relatively old, cratered highlands in the south. Some 20 years later, the Mars Global Surveyor mission showed that the crust of the planet is much thicker in the south and also revealed magnetic anomalies present in the southern hemisphere and not in the north.</p>
<p>"Two main explanations have been proposed for the hemispheric dichotomy--either some kind of internal process that changed one half of the planet, or a big impact hitting one side of it," Nimmo said. "The impact would have to be big enough to blast the crust off half of the planet, but not so big that it melts everything. We showed that you really can form the dichotomy that way."</p>
<p>Nimmo's group includes UCSC graduate student Shawn Hart, associate researcher Don Korycansky, and Craig Agnor of Queen Mary University, London. The other paper is by Margarita Marinova and Oded Aharonson of the California Institute of Technology and Erik Asphaug, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>The quantitative model used by Nimmo's group calculated the effects of an impact in two dimensions. Asphaug's group used a different model to calculate impacts in three dimensions, but with lower resolution (i.e., less detail in the simulation).</p>
<p>"The two approaches are very complementary; putting them together gives you a complete picture," Nimmo said. "The two-dimensional model provides high resolution, but you can only look at vertical impacts. The three-dimensional model allows nonvertical impacts, but the resolution is lower so you can't track what happens to the crust."</p>
<p>Most planetary impacts are not head-on, Asphaug said. His group found a "sweet spot" of impact conditions that result in a hemispheric dichotomy matching the observations. Those conditions include an impactor about one-half to two-thirds the size of the Moon, striking at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees.</p>
<p>"This is how planets finish their business of formation," Asphaug said. "They collide with other bodies of comparable size in gargantuan collisions. The last of those big collisions defines the planet."</p>
<p>According to Nimmo's analysis, shock waves from the impact would travel through the planet and disrupt the crust on the other side, causing changes in the magnetic field recorded there. The predicted changes are consistent with observations of magnetic anomalies in the southern hemisphere, he said.</p>
<p>In addition, new crust that formed in the northern lowlands would be derived from deep mantle rock melted by the impact and should have significantly different characteristics from the southern hemisphere crust. Certain Martian meteorites may have originated from the northern crust, Nimmo said. The study also suggests that the impact occurred around the same time as the impact on Earth that created the Moon.</p>
<p>This research was funded by NASA.</p>

The grant funds Zehr's ongoing research as a Moore Foundation investigator in marine science. In May, the foundation also provided $4.8 million in new funding for the marine microbiology research facility (MEGAMER) that Zehr oversees.</p>
<p>Both grants are renewals of earlier ones made as part of the Moore Foundation's Marine Microbiology Initiative, which aims to discover important new knowledge about the distribution, function, and ecological role of marine microbes.</p>
<p>"This is a wonderful opportunity and an exciting time for the marine microbiology field," Zehr said. "With new technologies making it possible to sequence the DNA of microorganisms and communities of microorganisms, we are poised to learn some of the fundamental processes that control the habitability of the oceans and the planet itself."</p>
<p>Zehr's research focuses on microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). His discoveries in this area have implications for understanding the ecology of the open ocean, the cycling of nutrients, and how the oceans might respond to global warming.</p>
<p>In the MEGAMER facility supported by the other grant, Zehr and his collaborators at UCSC and other institutions are focusing on the development of methods and instruments needed for the collection of real-time data in the ocean via remote processing (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2203">earlier press release</a>).</p>

<p>"The study shows that the warmer the temperature, the greater the advantage of the new strain. It also indicates that increases in temperatures due to global climate change would have major effects on transmission of the virus," said A. Marm Kilpatrick, first author of the paper and a senior research scientist for the <a href="http://www.conservationmedicine.org">Consortium for Conservation Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick, now an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, joined with Laura Kramer and others at the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Center to conduct the study, which examined the effects of different temperatures on the transmission of two strains of West Nile virus.</p>
<p>The first occurrence of West Nile virus in North America was in New York City in 1999, when it caused a die-off of crows and other birds and 62 reported cases of human infections, including 7 deaths. In the two years after the introduction of the virus, the rate of transmission was relatively low. As it spread along the Atlantic seaboard, there were only 21 reported human cases in 2000 and 66 in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2002, however, a new strain of the virus emerged and rapidly spread throughout North America, completely displacing the old strain by 2005. Coincident with the spread of this new strain were two of the largest epidemics of West Nile virus recorded to date in North America, with 4,582 cases reported in 2002, 11,356 cases in 2003, and more than 270 deaths in both years. Since then, the number of reported cases per year has ranged from 2,500 to nearly 6,000, with more than 100 deaths each year.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick and Kramer set out to determine how the new strain of West Nile virus had displaced the first strain, and what effect temperature had on transmission by mosquitoes. They used laboratory tests to determine how soon mosquitoes are capable of transmitting the virus after feeding on infected blood. The results showed that the new strain is more efficiently transmitted than the older strain, and the advantage of the new strain increases with higher temperatures.</p>
<p>For both strains, increases in temperature greatly accelerated transmission by increasing the efficiency of viral replication in the mosquitoes. As a result, temperature increases of just a few degrees due to global warming could sharply accelerate transmission of the virus and possibly lead to more severe epidemics of West Nile virus in some cooler regions, Kilpatrick said. The researchers used the results to develop a model to predict the impact of increasing temperatures on West Nile virus transmission by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>"A previous study in our lab demonstrated that the new strain of the virus was more efficient at replicating in mosquitoes, which may have increased the intensity of epidemics in the field," Kramer said. "We wanted to examine whether temperature might have played a role in the invasion of the new strain, and whether its success may have been related to increasing temperatures."</p>
<p>Kramer's lab performed a series of studies that involved infecting one group of mosquitoes with the introduced 1999 strain of West Nile virus and siblings with the recently evolved strain. After holding the mosquitoes at different temperatures and for different lengths of time, researchers determined what fraction could transmit the virus. They found that the new strain was more efficient than the introduced strain at nearly all temperatures and time points after infection.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick, who analyzed the data and developed models to predict the impact of temperature on transmission, said the results provide a striking example of how climate and evolution can interact to increase the transmission of this virus. "These results also suggest that relatively small increases in temperature can have large impacts, due to the nonlinear acceleration of transmission with temperature," he said.</p>
<p>"This study shows how direct the impacts of climate change could be for us all," said Peter Daszak, executive director of the Consortium for Conservation Medicine, based at Wildlife Trust in New York. "It isn't just about a rise in sea level or the melting of a glacier in Alaska--it's about our health and our welfare."</p>
<p>In addition to Kilpatrick and Kramer, the coauthors of the paper include Mark Meola and Robin Moudy of the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health. The study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the National Science Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

Sutter Maternity and Surgery Center is part of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and the Central Coast Alliance for Health (CCAH).</p>
<p>Witt will receive a $10,000 scholarship to help pay for medical school fees and tuition.</p>
<p>The award was established in conjunction with the University of California, Santa Cruz, Foundation in 2007 by SMSC and CCAH to help carry out the Alliance's mission to provide high quality primary care to Central Coast Medi-Cal patients.</p>
<p>"I've decided to pursue a medical degree due mostly to my family's personal experience of having wonderful doctors and being taken care of in our times of most need," said Witt, a resident of Aptos. "I'm very honored to receive this award and look forward to caring for patients in our community."</p>
<p>The award supports a graduating senior with a major in Health Sciences at UCSC who will be entering an accredited medical school soon after successfully completing his or her bachelor's degree. The recipient's medical training must result in an M.D. or D.O. degree and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast to practice in the area of primary care and serve Medi-Cal patients.</p>
<p>"As a non-profit health plan that serves over 85,000 members we see the overwhelming need for more physicians who see Medi-Cal patients in our area," said Alan McKay, executive director of CCAH. "This is an excellent way to support the education of physicians who can return and help fill this need."</p>

This program provides eligible staff and academic employees an opportunity to voluntarily reduce their working time and corresponding pay in exchange for a number of advantages described in the START Program Guidelines. The reduction in time and pay will help the University achieve temporary salary savings during this period of budgetary shortfall.</p><p>All regular status (non-probationary career) staff employees and all academic personnel (except those in faculty and student academic titles and Postdoctoral Scholars) with appointments of at least 60 percent time are eligible to participate in START.</p><p>For exclusively represented employees, participation in START is subject to collective bargaining. Currently, we have agreement with UPTE for the participation of employees in the Research Support Professional (RX), Technical (TX) and Residual Health Care (HX) bargaining units. All other exclusively represented employees are not eligible to participate at this time.</p><p>The START Program is a tool that department heads, with approval from their respective Principal Officer, may choose to make available to their employees during the period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2010. This will give Principal Officers and their departments the potential to implement START within the context of their missions, operational needs, service requirements, and budgets. Please be advised that department heads and their associated Principal Officers may elect to offer the program for the entire 24-month period; others may elect to offer the program only during certain months such as the summer months; and some may elect not to offer the START program in their unit at all.</p><p>In units that have elected to offer START, employees who want to participate in the program must request the department head's approval to voluntarily reduce their working time, within specific limits, from a minimum of one month to a maximum of 24 months. In considering whether to approve an employee's participation in START, it is important that department heads and Principal Officers evaluate priorities and workloads to ensure that functional objectives continue to be met.</p><p>Additional information regarding the program guidelines, program brochure describing the features of START, including useful questions and answers, and START contract forms are available online at: <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/">http://shr.ucsc.edu/</a></p><p>For staff employees requesting participation in START effective July 1, 2008, completed and approved START contract forms must be received by the appropriate HR Service Team no later than July 9, 2008. Questions about the program should be directed your HR Service Team Representative, <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/hrst/hrst_locate-team.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/hrst/hrst_locate-team.htm</a></p><p>For academic personnel requesting participation in START effective July 1, 2008, completed and approved START contract forms must be received by the appropriate divisional academic personnel coordinator by July 9, 2008. Questions about the program should also be directed to your divisional academic personnel coordinator.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Willeen McQuitta, Director of Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91575d348072704601a012ff5578e2c9"><name>2314</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gerhard Ringel, professor emeritus of mathematics, dies at age 88</title><keywords>Gerhard Ringel</keywords><start-date>1214809200000</start-date><display-name>Gerhard Ringel, professor emeritus...</display-name><path>/2008/06/2314</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/06/2314</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338675964</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338675964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/06/images/ringel_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/06/images/ringel_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ringel_200.jpg</name><file-size>41125</file-size><width>200</width><height>285</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gerhard Ringel</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is with sadness that I inform you of the death of Professor Gerhard Ringel. Gerhard came to UCSC as Professor in 1970. He was one of the world leaders in the fields of Combinatorics and Graph Theory and was much honored for his seminal work including the solution (with J.W.T. Youngs) of the famous Heawood Conjecture in genus p greater than one. This conjecture gave a formula for the minimum number of colors H(p) needed to color a map on a surface of genus p, namely</p>
<p>H(p) = [ 1/2( 7 + √( 48p + 1)) ]</p>
<p>The only exceptions in their proof were the Sphere , Plane and Klein Bottle.</p>
<p>He was awarded two honorary degrees, one from Karlsruhe and the other from Berlin, and served on several distinguished editorial boards. In 1988, he was honored by the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate by his selection as Faculty Research Lecturer.</p>
<p>Gerhard served as our Chair for thirteen years and was admired and liked by his colleagues. A memorial service is being planned for the Fall.</p>
